Menopause transition (MT) is a hormonal imbalance in women starting at the age of 40 that elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. The decline in estrogen during menopause increases the risk of CVD. In racial and ethnic minority groups, this risk is higher, particularly among Blacks (58.5%), Hispanics (42.7%), and Asians (42.5%). (American Heart Association, 2021). The study analyzes the demographic data of CVD-related medical conditions and their relationship with MT, which highlights the importance of addressing CVD health during menopause.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
The study examines sex, age, race, and cardiovascular disease-related conditions (hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) in a sample of 372,380 participants from the National Institute of Health (NIH) All of Us Data Browser and Workbench. The data was analyzed to raise awareness of CVD risk in women. The All of Us Research Data Browser was used to obtain information regarding age and sex, whereas the data collected from the All of Us Workbench was regarding race and ethnicity. The racial and ethnic categories include Asian, Black, White, Hispanics and Latinos, and Other (which contain the subcategories ""I prefer not to answer,"" ""None Indicated,"" ""None of these,"" and ""Skip”). This study analyzed data using descriptive and explanatory statistics using Microsoft Excel frequency measures.","Anticipated Findings
Women tend to have a higher incidence rate of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia compared to men which suggests an increased risk of developing CVD.
The All of Us Research Data Browser highlights the disparity in CVD incidence rates between different racial and ethnic groups. The All of Us data helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between age, gender, and race in the prevalence of CVD-related conditions. Finally, we anticipate women to have a greater risk of acquiring CVD-related conditions during menopausal transition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Noncoding regulatory elements, such as enhancers, act as regulators of gene expression. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project and other studies have identified millions of regulatory elements in various tissues. The roles of noncoding regulatory elements in many human diseases have acquired considerable attention, including in cancer, cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disorders. GWAS studies in understanding the genetic basis of these diseases has also identified many noncoding regulatory variants responsible for genetic risk, yet the mechanisms behind these risk variants remain poorly understood. Recent integrating multidimensional genomic data, such as expression, methylation, histone modification, chromatin accessibility and three-dimensional organization data, have enhanced interpretation of noncoding risk variants in human diseases.  However, systematic analysis multidimensional genomic data make things more complex and has become a big challenge in the field.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we will develop novel and powerful computational methods to systematically discover the potential biomarker and drug target in human diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, asthma, T2D, and many other metabolism diseases based on multidimensional genomic data. We first will identify molecular differences between healthy individuals and patients based on these sequencing data. The All of Us project provides a great resource of genomic data in well-phenotype, disease-relevant populations. We will identify differences between healthy individuals and patients based on All of Us sequencing data. And then using newly developed computational methods to systematically integrate multidimensional genomic data from other cohorts.","Anticipated Findings
In this study, we will develop novel computational methods to systematically discover these diseases causing changes in noncoding elements, which may be used as drug target in the future. Computational tools will be shared with all researchers.

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers. In response to FNIH RFP2 “GENERATION of New genetic, -omic, or biomarker data for Common Metabolic Diseases,” we propose to generate and discover novel genetic associations in the All of Us Research Program.","Project Purpose(s)

We will perform disease, disease-related trait, and covariate harmonization in the All of Us Cohort for diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease outcomes and hypertension), disease-related traits (glycemic traits, CVD risk factors, blood pressure), and important covariates (adiposity traits, smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). We will report counts and power calculations that describe the genetic associations that could be discovered in the All of Us Cohort. We will explore the availability of additional common metabolic diseases and complications and perform power calculations for these traits. We will perform genetic association analyses with each disease and outcome (type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and NAFLD).","Anticipated Findings

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex cardiovascular disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, leading to impaired cardiac function and an increased risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Despite extensive research, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms contributing to HCM remain incompletely understood. Integrating genomic and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data can provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of HCM, aiding in the development of more accurate diagnostic tools and targeted therapeutic strategies.

Gout is an inflammatory metabolic disease affecting > 4% of US adults, including > 9% of those over age 65.  People with gout can experience very painful and disabling attacks (flares) in their joints and are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.
Gout results from high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricaemia) and studies by our group and others have identified many environmental, clinical, and genetic factors associated with gout. These include diuretic medications (increased risk), and coffee and vitamin C (decreased risk).  However, despite evidence that gout is having a greater impact on men and women in non-White racial groups in the US, most factors were identified in people of self-reported White race.
To address these gaps, we are exploring the AllofUs data to plan future studies on the environmental, genetic, and clinical factors associated with gout (or worse gout outcomes) in women and men of different racial/ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate using the EHR data and self-reported survey data to classify participants’ gout status and uric acid levels.

We anticipate using logistic regression models to evaluate the association between exposures and the risk of gout or hyperuricemia, adjusting for well-established gout risk factors such as overweight/obesity and use of diuretic medications.  We will also assess for joint effects and interactions between exposures, including genetic exposures drawn from the Genomics dataset.  For example, our prior analysis of a different cohort of mainly White adults found that excess BMI can exacerbate the impact of carrying certain hyperuricemia genes on the risk of gout.  Mediation analysis will be performed to quantify factors influencing sex- or racial differences in the burden of gout.","Anticipated Findings

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects women, or people with ovaries, worldwide. Because non-female identifying people with ovaries are a population of interest in this study, the proposed study will not exclude those who identify as another gender but were assigned the female sex at birth. People diagnosed with PCOS, typically via sonogram or ultrasound, also present with numerous other health issues. Being diagnosed with PCOS is also linked to reproductive irregularity, insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, and many more. These different aspects of health are issues known for being further affected by minority identities such as non-white Race and sexual/gender minorities. Not having enough power, or a large sample size, may be adversely affecting the associations among people with PCOS and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although, there seems to be inconsistency among studies finding statistically significant relationships between CVD risk and PCOS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The overall study design will consist of a cross-sectional case control where age, sex, and race will be matched between cases and controls.  The main outcome variable is CVD risk, which will be measured as a score of 3 levels: ideal, average, and poor. This score is taken from the American Heart Association’s guidelines on assessing and preventing cardiovascular disease. This is known as the Life’s Simple 7 score and is compiled through covariates of heart disease like smoking status, BMI, exercise, cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose, and diet. In addition to those covariates, demographic information, which is also collected by All of Us, will be included in the analysis. There will be an attempt to keep many diverse racial and gender/sexual minorities (assuming sample sizes are adequate). Statistical analysis plans will consist of logistic regression on a three-level factored outcome variable (Simple 7 score).","Anticipated Findings
The researcher anticipates interpretable findings from this study. Because the research question is presented as an investigation of a relationship, there is no anticipation of whether the CVD risk among PCOS populations will sway one way or the other. Previous literature and research has shown that there may be an increased risk of CVD among these populations, which may be exacerbated by the presence of other determinants of health like race, assigned sex at birth, and many more. Overall, the purpose of the study is to add validated and sound research to the body of literature with All of Us data, specifically.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question
What is the incidence of heart failure or adverse cardiac events in Black/ African American women who are long-term (5 years or more) survivors of breast cancer?
Why is this question important?
African American (AA) breast cancer survivors may have elevated risk for cardiovascular disease because of the high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in this population.
Primary Objective
The primary objective is to quantify both cardiovascular risk and adverse cardiac events in long-term (five years or greater) breast cancer survivors, and determine how cardiovascular risk prior to diagnosis, during treatment, and after completion of treatment affects health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare multi-system disease which arises from a chromosomal microdeletion of 7q11.23, comprising 25 to 27 genes, including the elastin gene. The defects in the elastin gene, leading to elastin haploinsufficiency, underlie the arteriopathy in WBS, although alternate genes are known to modulate cardiovascular phenotypes. Cardiovascular problems are the main cause of morbidity and mortality and occur in 80-85% of all WS patients. Great vessel diseases are the most common cardiovascular abnormalities in WBS, however any artery can potentially be involved due to elastin haploinsufficiency.  Sudden cardiac death is also a prominent feature that is the leading cause of death among WBS patients. Recent studies pointed out the autonomic and heart rate dysregulations in WBS. Based on this, we would like to investigate the heart rate and sleep patterns among WBS patients.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the genetics and associated information in the All of Us research dataset to analyze genetic contributions to bipolar disorder, its comorbidities and treatment response, in racial and ethnic minority populations. Specific questions we will ask are:
1. Are the genetic associations for bipolar disorder previously identified in white populations also associated with Black and Latino populations?
2. Are genetic associations between biopolar disorder and cardiovascular disease (or metabolic syndrome) observed in white, Black, and Latino populations?
3. Are there unique genetic polymorphisms in Black populations associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder treatment?
We hypothesize that genetic associations with bipolar disorder in racial and ethnic minority populations will partially overlap with genetic variation previously identified in white populations, but that there will be unique population-specific variation as well, particularly for lithium response.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Bipolar Disorder)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use PLINK and/or other GWAS tools within the All of Us Research Workbench on whole genome sequence data. The population with bipolar disorder or manic episodes without a bipolar disorder diagnosis will be defined by ICD-10-CM codes of F31.x and/or F30.x respectively. Racial and gender self-identification will be used as primary covariates with other demographic variables (e.g., age) considered as confounding variables. Ancestry informative markers and whole genome PCA will be used to control for genetic ancestry and population substructure. We will also consider BMI and other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol diabetes). Lastly we will examine therapeutic doses of lithium and lithium response (where possible). Limitations include lack of specificity in diagnosis and/or presentation and incomplete or unclear data on efficacy of specific pharmaceutical therapy.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate confirming that genetic variation associated with bipolar disorder in white populations is similar, though not necessarily identical, in racial and ethnic minority populations. We also anticipate identifying genetic factors unique to these populations, particularly associated with lithium response. Trans-ethnic studies are important, even as validation studies, because they extend our understanding of disease to populations that have been traditionally underserved in medicine. Further, these studies will elucidate differences in response to lithium that have hindered proper access to treatment.
Because the intersection of mental health, genetics, and racial disparities can be stigmatizing, we surveyed the patient community and developed a community advisory board (CAB) of stakeholders (including patients) focused on bipolar disorder and genomics for regular feedback. This is in addition to more general CABs and collaborative efforts towards mental health literacy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

I have developed a method called SLAC-Time, which utilizes a self-supervised learning approach for clustering multivariate time series data with missing values. I intend to apply SLAC-Time to group patients with cardiovascular diseases using the data from the All of Us dataset. This is fitting, as these patients are represented through clinical multivariate time-series data. Therefore, this context presents a suitable scenario for evaluating the effectiveness of SLAC-Time. In this research, I will investigate if SLAC-Time provides clinically meaningful clusters of cardiovascular patients and if there is a significant difference between the clusters. We are going to identify the feature profile of the cardiovascular patient phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular diseases)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
The scientific approaches I plan to employ in this study mainly revolve around the utilization of SLAC-Time, a self-supervised learning-based method I have developed. This approach is tailored for clustering multivariate time series data, even in instances where certain values may be missing.
The primary dataset I intend to work with is the All of Us dataset, which contains a wealth of health data from diverse individuals. This dataset is particularly useful for my study, as it includes a rich set of clinical multivariate time-series data that represents patients with cardiovascular diseases.
Lastly, the tools I will use for this study are likely to be a combination of machine learning frameworks, statistical analysis software, and data visualization tools. They will be used to implement SLAC-Time, analyze the results, and visually represent the clusters of cardiovascular patients and their defining features.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study will hopefully reveal that SLAC-Time can effectively cluster cardiovascular patients in a manner that produces clinically meaningful clusters. Additionally, we expect to find a significant difference between these clusters, which will give us insights into the various phenotypes of cardiovascular patients.
These findings will contribute to the body of scientific knowledge by providing a new perspective on patient grouping based on time-series data. Moreover, the application of SLAC-Time on cardiovascular disease data could help in personalized treatment approaches, understanding disease progression patterns, and potentially uncovering new subtypes of cardiovascular diseases. The ability to handle missing data will also provide a more robust tool for real-world clinical data, which often contains gaps. This can potentially lead to more accurate disease prediction and patient management strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is a key enzyme in the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and is associated with ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Knockout rats for SphK1 gene exhibited heightened susceptibility of the myocardium to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, which impaired protective effects of IPC (PMID: 17610857). S1P exerts its protective function by binding to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). A specific genetic variant of S1PR1 (rs41287280, c.37C>T, p.R13G) has previously been identified as a potential protective factor against coronary artery disease (PMID: 25293589). However, the impact of this genetic variant on cardiovascular outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI) patients remains uncertain. Hence, this study aims to investigate the independent association between the rs41287280 genetic variant and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in patients with MI.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective community-based cohort study will be conducted enrolling all genotyped patients who had myocardial infarction (MI). All demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will be collected. Patients will be stratified into two subgroups according the harboring of the genetic variant. A propensity score matching method will be used to match patients by their clinical variables at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression will be applied to assess the independent association between the rs41287280 genetic variant and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (primary: 3-point MACE; secondary: CV death, non-fatal MI, hospitalization for heart failure). Bonferroni's p-value correction method will be applied to prevent false-positive associations.","Anticipated Findings
If our findings corroborate previous evidence, individuals with the rs41287280 genetic variant are expected to experience significantly fewer cardiovascular events compared to those without the variant. This is the first study to date to reveal the influence of this genetic variant on cardiovascular outcomes in individuals who have experienced myocardial infarction (MI). The research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge regarding the impact of genetics on the individual variability of cardiovascular outcomes in those with similar clinical characteristics. Furthermore, it may unravel the significance of protective metabolic pathways, such as SphK1-SP1, in activating ischemic preconditioning, which holds immense therapeutic potential.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Primary headache disorders, including migraine, are debilitating neurological conditions, managed with acute and preventive treatment, with and without medications.  Aerobic walking has several health benefits, it is included as one of non-pharmachological treatment strategies. Counting steps during walking is a method of evaluating daily activity, and may help individuals achieve physical activity goals. A higher number of steps per day has been associated with reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, GERD,  but limited information is available for migraine and other headache disorders.

All participants with FitBit data will be included in this study. Our data set will include demographic information, history of medical conditions (cardiovascular, obesity, depression), headache disorders diagnosed by eletronic health records and by self-report diagnosis at the patient provided information medical history questionnaire,  mean blood pressure, height, weight, mean waist circumference, mean hip circumference, mean heart rate, and daily summary activity Fitbit data. Mean number of steps per day will be illustrated with descriptive statistics. We will analyze differences in mean steps per day for our subgroups of interest  with t-tests, and plot daily step counts with incident risk of headache disorders.","Anticipated Findings
The goal of this project is to describe physical activity in individuals diagnosed with headache disorders by quantifying the amount of steps taken per day. We also aim to understand if steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex in headache patients versus matched controls without pain conditions and any other disease. Based on prior literature, we predict a mean number of steps per day of approximately 5,000. Migraine individuals may have lower mean steps compare to controls.  Additionally, we predict mean steps per day will be higher in male and white participants.
Further, we expect the relationship between steps per day and migraine is inverse and linear.  The findings may provide a real-world evidence-base for clinical guidance regarding activity levels that are necessary to reduce the disease burden of headache disorders.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mosaicism of chromosomes is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. While this age-related phenomenon has been known for many years, awareness of the potential role of mosaicism in human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancers, and cardiovascular disease, is a more recent development. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mosaicism in hematopoietic cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Based on prior studies, cardiac (atrial) inflammation, and fibrosis can result in disruption of normal atrial conduction and is a powerful predictor of risk for the development and progression of atrial fibrillation. In the current study, we aim to better understand the association of mosaicism with the development and progression of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to characterize a spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 genetic variants. More than a decade after the discovery of the trypanolytic missense variants in APOL1, it is now known that APOL1 high-risk variants are relatively common in individuals with sub-Saharan ancestry and are associated with higher risk of progressive chronic kidney disease. Although associations with cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, and preeclampsia have been reported, these associations warrant replication. Considering the expression of APOL1 in a wide range of cell types and that it is found as both a circulating and intracellular protein, it is likely that other diseases may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants and that these associations may be missed due to study design and statistical power. We plan to conduct a phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) using All of Us datasets to shed light to possible undetected diseases and phenotypes that may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Since APOL1 is exclusively found in individuals with sub-Saharan African ancestry, we plan to create a cohort of individuals who self-identify as Black (including Hispanic, African, African American, and Caribbean individuals and assess corresponding genomics data (for APOL1 genotyping), electronic health record (EHR) data of AoU datasets including diagnosis (ICD) and baseline demographics and measurements (BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, clinical chemistry data, and hormone levels). We will classify individuals into three groups based on the number of risk alleles carried: 0 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G0 genotype), 1 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G1, G0/G2), and 2 APOL1 risk alleles (G1/G1, G1/G2, G2/G2). Then, we will conduct a phenome-wide association study, to define the spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 high-risk variants using PheWAS R package.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases, creatinine and albuminuria measurements will show association with APOL1 high-risk genotypes that are consistent with previous reports, but given the size of the All-of-Us cohort, should narrow the confidence interval giving a more precise odds-ratio and a relative risk. Similarly, we can confirm (or not) the previously reported associations of sepsis, preeclampsia, and cardiovascular diseases with APOL1 high-risk genotypes, which would bring additional evidence that the association between these conditions and APOL1 high-risk genotypes. If novel phenotypes are found to be associated with APOL1 high-risk variant this will open new areas for investigation of APOL1-associated phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research team focuses on establishing genotype-phenotype relationships in cardiovascular diseases, as well as exploring gene-first screening strategies. We aim to combine mixed methods of Mendelian with polygenic and expand beyond the exome using whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. Establish genotype relationships with known phenotypic traits including cardiovascular diseases.
Aim 2. Combine genotype and phenotype relationships to predict outcomes.
Aim 3. Use gene-first screening in large scale biobanks to test the utility in predicting new incident disease as well as outcomes (such as mortality, sudden death risk, heart failure, arrhythmia).","Project Purpose(s)

Our usual approach is phenotype to genotype in classic Mendelian disease. This has poor yield and is being challenged with the role of other effect modifier genes or SNPs. Thus, we will annotate variants using our established pipelines using whole genome sequencing within All of Us and test phenotypes, development of disease and complications. We will also conduct time-to-event analyses to determine if genotype can affect outcomes (such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, need for device, ablation, as well as mortality).
We will require access to:
- Whole genome sequencing
- Physical measurements and wearables
- EHR domains for conditions, drug exposures, labs and measurements, procedures
- Surveys (all)
Validating findings in our internal (Helix) and other databases (UK Biobank) will be crucial to show reproducibility.","Anticipated Findings
1. We will report genetic yield in white and non-white participants , as well as differences, with established CVD (cardiomyopathy, inherited arrhythmias, dyslipidemias, aortopathies) to validate our pipelines.
2. We will test gene-first approaches by annotating variants in all those with WGS and compare outcomes in those deemed to be carrying a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant. We predict that these will show penetrance for 10% or less, but will predict likelihood of developing heart failure, atrial fibrillation, need for cardiac device and mortality vs. wild-type carriers.
3. We will determine the effects of SNPs combined with known Mendelian (usually monogenic disease).
4. We will test penetrance of ACMG-78 actionable genes of which <50% are cardiovascular.

A leading cause of death and disability, there has been increasing interest in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke etc.) earlier in life using genetic information to appropriately identify individuals who are most at risk. These predictions are based on using multiple genetic markers and are called polygenic risk scores.
Individuals with chronic kidney disease are particularly at risk of cardiovascular disease, with risk increasing as kidney function declines. Given kidney function changes over the course of an individual’s life, predicting events in this population may be more difficult.
We would like to assess how existing polygenic risk scores perform in the kidney disease population and if this can help target treatments to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (kidney disease)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use existing polygenic risk scores and assess their performance in the chronic kidney disease population. It is well established that existing genetic risk scores perform poorly in populations with different ancestry from which they were developed. Given measurable disparities in kidney disease and associated cardiovascular disease, we hope to assess performance stratified by genetic ancestry.
Prior to using genetic data, we are going to study the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in AllofUs stratified by self-reported ethnicity and assess whether there are enough cardiovascular events to perform the analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that polygenic risk scores generated in a predominantly European ancestry populations will perform poorly in individuals with kidney impairment, particularly when applied to individuals with different and diverse ancestry.
Although impairments of kidney function are common, repeated measures of kidney function are often lacking in the general population. We can use this to understand to what extent the change in kidney function over time is contributing to differences in performance. This latter aspect has not been addressed in prior work.
This work will provide valuable insights into utility of genetic scores for cardiovascular disease in the kidney disease population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease risk is known to be influenced by both the severity of a risk factor and the duration of exposure. However, this concept has been largely neglected within the obesity literature. While obesity severity has been closely linked with cardiometabolic diseases, the risk of developing these conditions among those with obesity may be augmented by greater obesity duration over the lifespan. Few longitudinal or contemporary studies have investigated the influence of both factors in combination – cumulative obesity exposure – instead generally focusing on obesity severity, often at a single time point, given ease of use and lack of established methods to encapsulate duration. We aim to assess the influence of obesity duration on the incidence of a variety of CVD diagnoses within AllofUs.","Project Purpose(s)

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in Americans, but certain minority groups are more affected, one being African Americans. Heart disease is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle. African Americans with heart disease were also impacted by Covid-19. Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During the Covid-19 pandemic, African Americans who had heart disease developed a condition called myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the middle layer of the heart. It can cause a weakened heart, heart failure, abnormal heartbeat, and sudden death. There seemed to be a link between myocarditis patients and people who tested positive for Covid-19. This research showed that cardiovascular disease was found in African Americans more after they had been impacted by Covid-19, which led to myocarditis because of their dietary habits, physical inactivity, and stress.","Project Purpose(s)

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease. Thus, the purpose of this workspace is  to develop internal methods for examining the association between polygenic risk scores of unique intermediate phenotypes derived in diverse  population based cohorts, and overt cardiometabolic disease within All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will leverage whole genome sequencing data from multiple, diverse, population based cohorts to derive polygenic risk scores for a variety of novel phenotypes using multiple methods such as: clumping/pruning and thresholding (PRSice), LDpred2, and PRS-CS. Validated scores will then be constructed for each All of Us participant and the association between polygenic risk and cardiometabolic diseases will be examined.","Anticipated Findings
The current workbench serves as a first step toward identifying novel pathways linking intermediate phenotypes available in our diverse population based cohorts to cardiometabolic disease risk in All of Us. Furthermore, there is considerable interest in developing and validating polygenic risk scores in diverse populations to shrink gaps in clinical care across ethnic and socioeconomic groups. We aim to work toward precision medicine that is applicable to all populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population. Mounting evidence indicates that this impact disproportionately affects minority populations. Most factors underlying these health disparities pertain to the social determinants of health, but it is unclear how biological factors play a role or interact with these social determinants. The main questions of this study are: (1) can we use All of US to identify novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are specific to a given minority group? (2) Are existing risk factors for CVD shared across all minority groups? (3) Can we disentangle the contributions of social determinants of health and biological factors contributing to cardiovascular disease? These questions are important to develop precision medicine strategies to identify high-risk individuals across underrepresented groups for tailored diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the All of US dataset V5. We will identify variables that represent (1) cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke); (2) all the known risk factors for each of these conditions; (3) physiological variables that either define a risk factor or are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A1C); (4) polygenic risk scores for these conditions and their corresponding risk factors; and (5) identify the underrepresented groups of interest. We will use linear and logistic regression to test for association between risk factors, social determinants of health, genomic risk scores, and the conditions of interest, and product terms to test for effect modification between contributor variables.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that: (1) a substantial number of the known vascular risk factors increase risk of cardiovascular disease across all evaluated groups; (2) both social determinants of health and polygenic susceptibility are independently associated with these cardiovascular conditions; and (3) there are interactions between the effect of social determinants of health and polygenic contribution to disease. These findings will help us develop and test precision medicine strategies to identify high-risk individuals across underrepresented groups for tailored diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Aim 1. Examine if physical activity measured with FitBit is associated with four cardiovascular diseases (AFIB, MI, stroke, heart failure). This first aim will determine if FitBit, a commercially available product with over 30 million users, is able to measure PA with the same accuracy as current standard measurement technologies. This will be accomplished by demonstrating the same pattern of association as previously established literature.
Aim 2. Determine if heart rate, stratified by nicotine use, is associated with four cardiovascular diseases.The second aim will quantify heart rates patterns which are associated with CVD. These heart rates will be stratified by four tobacco use groups to allow examination of tobacco use as a potential moderator of the relationship between heart rate and CVD.","Project Purpose(s)

Logistic models, both stratified by tobacco and not stratified, will examine the association between PA and CVD.","Anticipated Findings
This research will advance the science of CVD in two ways. First, if FitBit data is shown to be an accurate method for collecting PA data will allow researchers to access historical data on research participants as well as have accurate real-time measurements. Second, this study will determine if ECIG use confers the same increase in odds of CVD as CIG use.

I want to use Artificial Intelligence to predict at what age a person is most likely to develop moderate to severe heart disease based on a variety of inputs, including their age, family history, other medical conditions, and lifestyle. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, based off of data from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Our training data will be the group of people who have already been diagnosed with a form of heart disease, and at what age they were given this diagnosis. Our inputs to the model will include traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease, such as age, height, and weight of a person, if they’ve already been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes, family history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and/or diabetes, their smoking and drinking habits, and their physical lifestyle. We will also explore various other inputs included within the All of Us dataset to investigate whether there are additional inputs which may be a significant indicator of developing heart disease. Modern machine learning methods such as supervised classification algorithms and supervised regression algorithms will be implemented using Python. Our output will be a potential age range of when they are likely to develop a moderate to severe diagnosis of heart disease.","Anticipated Findings

Can deep learning be applied to ECG data to detect those with arrhythmias of monogenic inheritance? Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for around half of cardiovascular deaths in the United States (US). SCD heritable risk factors contribute to the risk of SCD through monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS). However, routine clinical genomic testing of arrhythmias is inaccessible by its undetermined timeline for large scale employment, complicated by cost and requirement of expert interpretation at large scale. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical modality used to measure electrical activity of the heart, serving as a first-line diagnostic touchpoint for patients, with and without suspected cardiac abnormalities. This study proposes to leverage DL to identify ECG features that indicate monogenic risk of SCD using electronic health record (EHR) and ECG data.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Monogenic arrythmias)","Scientific Approaches
To improve the identification of monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes in individuals of diverse ancestry, I will use a deep learning architecture to classify those with genotype-positive disease using clinical and ECG data. This will require use of genomics, electronic health records (EHR), and ECG datasets and coding with SQL and Python in the Research Notebook. While models have been created to classify these different conditions independently, an algorithm has yet to be developed that will classify monogenic predisposition to arrhythmia, with appreciation for ancestry diversity. To determine algorithm utility, I will determine the proportion of individuals with a monogenic inherited arrhythmia diagnosis in their EHR to ascertain new detected cases.  I hypothesize that by integrating data from All of Us, this algorithm will apply widely to diverse populations.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to find a model that can increase selection of patients of diverse ancestry who are genotype positive for monogenic IAS. I will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine missed diagnoses not captured by EHR and number of averted SCD with earlier diagnosis. With access to longitudinal medical record information, I am well positioned to discover non-traditional ECG signatures of patients with monogenic IAS before episodes of SCA through explainability analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.

There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Second, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions.

These facts indicate that Hispanic or Latinos may face more physical inactivity related CVD problems in the future.","Project Purpose(s)

Step 1: Identifying differentially expressed SNP signatures associated with CVD.
We will use GENESIS R package to identify the differentially expressed SNP signature patterns. The signature patterns identified from CVD will be taken to generate an overlapped pattern as one of the inputs for step 2.

Structure question models (SEM) will be applied to examine the association among stress, overall GRS from SNPs, PA, CVD, and other cardiovascular risk factors.","Anticipated Findings
Neither ongoing nor published studies focused on the network involving SNP, PA, stress and CVD. Therefore, by using structural equation model (SEM), the goal of this study is to expand previous studies to reveal the moderating effect of PA and SNP on the association between stress and CVD (hypothesized model is shown in a separate figure file).

Metabolic syndrome is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which has been identified as one of the major contributors to the 10-25 year decreased life expectancy in schizophrenic patients. Compared to the general population, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is five times greater in people with schizophrenia.
Scientific questions that we would like to study is as follows:
1) Is prevalence of metabolic syndrome higher in patients with schizophrenia compared to general participants in All of Us dataset?
2) Is metabolic syndrome associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and T2DM in schizophrenia patients?
3) Do schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome report worse qualify of life or perceive their health status to be worse than schizophrenia patients without the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome?
4) What are the risk factors of having metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (schizophrenia)","Scientific Approaches
In this study, we will include participants from All of Us dataset version 6. Schizophrenia cohort is defined as having at least one ICD-9/10 diagnosis code for schizophrenia. Metabolic syndrome cohort will be defined as having any 3 or more of the following conditions: 1) waist circumference more than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women, 2) elevated triglycerides 150 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL), 3) reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) less than 40 mg/dL in men or less than 50 mg/dL in women, 4) elevated fasting glucose of l00 mg/dL or greater, 5) blood pressure values of systolic 130 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic 85 mmHg or higher. Analysis will be performed in the web-based platform Jupyter Notebook using programming language R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to have higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia compared to general participants in All of Us dataset. Metabolic syndrome is anticipated to be associated with higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and T2DM in schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome is expected to report worse quality of life, mental or physical well-being. Smoking, excessive drinking, family history of diabetes, use of clozapine or olanzapine are expected to be associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients. These have been reported in various studies but data from larger national sample would contribute to the growing evidence the anticipated findings stated above.","Demographic Categories of Interest

To complete my MPH degree, I plan to use this dataset for my capstone project. I plan to research the association between perceived neighborhood safety and cardiovascular disease among AoU participants. I plan to see if renting or owning a home has any additional effect and after, if having a condition of a mental health diagnosis. I plan to do a cross-sectional analysis with the dataset.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (heart disease)","Scientific Approaches
The dependent variable was incidence of the condition cardiovascular disease, which would include at least one of the following diagnoses – heart disease, congenital heart disease, coronary arteriosclerosis. The condition was evaluated as a nominal variable. The main independent variable was perceived neighborhood safety which was derived from the survey prompt, “My neighborhood is safe.” There were 4 Likert scale responses: agree, strongly agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. I will consider the covariates of housing ownership and mental health and use logistic regressions to run analyses between these variables and covariates.","Anticipated Findings
I hypothesize that a lower perception of neighborhood safety will be a significant factor of cardiovascular disease among participants. This would be very helpful when considering social determinants of health and could assist with policy design and community interventions. Previous studies have looked at perceived neighborhood safety and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and have found significant results. This would take it a step further to make a direct connection between neighborhood safety and CVD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Scientific Questions: (1) How SDOH impact gender disparities in hazardous alcohol use and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  (2) How are diagnosis and access to treatment for CVD among women who are hazardous alcohol users impacted by SDOH.
We anticipate to find a relationship between  SDOH and gender and the outcomes: hazardous alcohol use and co-occurring CVD. This is an understudied area with public health implications as women are less likely to seek treatment for alcohol use and CVD is the No. 1 killer of women, causing 1 in 3 deaths each year. The impact of SDOH on these outcomes are underexplored.","Project Purpose(s)

We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Previous research has demonstrated a connection between chronic stress and health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. Chronic stress is also known to associate with inflammation and other markers of biologic dysfunction. We seek to investigate the relationship between chronic stress and lipid levels in All of Us participants. These findings have relevant public health and clinical implications. By better understanding the connection between individual- and neighborhood-level stressors and lipids, work can be done to tailor stress-reduction and community-based interventions to improve health outcomes. Additionally, addressing chronic stressors can be incorporated into clinical practice to prevent cardiovascular disease and poor outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health

We plan to use “Social Determinants of Health ” survey data, neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation data, and lipid, statin therapy, and demographic data from the controlled tier. We will use linear regression modeling and other statistical methods to examine the relationship between chronic stressors and lipid levels, explore effect modification by race/ethnicity and gender.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that individual- and neighborhood-level chronic stressors, such as discrimination or neighborhood disorder, will associate with lipid levels in All of Us participants, with race/ethnicity and gender potentially impacting these patterns. These findings will provide insight into the biological impact of the social determinants and how these changes might play a role in cardiovascular disease disparities.","Demographic Categories of Interest
