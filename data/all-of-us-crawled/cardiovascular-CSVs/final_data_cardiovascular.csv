Many women experience a worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors (such as blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body fat quantity/localization) around midlife. The menopausal transition, and its associated hormonal changes, may contribute to some of this increased cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk. Each individual woman can react differently to menopause, and studies by SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) and others have shown that different women experience different trajectories of hormonal and cardiometabolic changes around the time of the final menstrual period.
I would like to identify genetic and other factors that are associated with cardiometabolic risk factor trajectories in midlife women. This could help to better understand how menopause impacts cardiometabolic health and could help to predict how individual women may respond to menopause and perhaps help to tailor lifestyle interventions, treatments, etc. to each woman (precision medicine).","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Disease and Menopause)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The first step will be to extract the timing of the final menstrual period (FMP) from the dataset, if available, for each woman participant. If that is successful, I will then proceed to extract longitudinal values of relevant cardiometabolic traits (LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, BMI, etc.) for each woman, and calculate the timing of each value relative to the FMP. Then, women will be categorized based on the trajectory of each cardiometabolic trait around the time of menopause. Finally, we will search for genetic and covariate associations with each trajectory category.","Anticipated Findings
If successful, this study could take a step towards understanding how and why different women react differently to menopause, in terms of their cardiometabolic health. This could help to identify women who may be likely to experience particular cardiometabolic risk factor trajectories before they even enter the menopausal transition, potentially allowing for early intervention and more effective prevention of disease. It could also help to better understand why menopause affects cardiometabolic risk factors through identification of particular genes that could contribute to the mechanism.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program. Chronic disease is a rising contributor to mortality and morbidity, and many chronic disease risk factors are modifiable. Learning how we can more effectively prevent and control chronic disease among diverse patient populations will be essential for population health improvement. We specifically plan to study the intersection between different chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that interact with one another and cause progressive disability.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use a combination of descriptive tools (e.g. estimating prevalence, incidence of various conditions) and modeling tools to model the accumulation of disease risk factors and mortality. Our work will be performed primarily using All of Us data with additional work performed in other population-based data sources including EHR data, UK Biobank, and other large studies.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our study will document the prevalence and risk of developing various types of multimorbidity and chronic disease burden over time and will identify novel risk factors for multimorbidity which could be targeted both to improve population health and to improve health equity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question: Is there a significant association between race/ethnicity, allostatic load, perceived stress, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among breast cancer survivors?
Racial disparities persist in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive research and intervention strategies. Examining stress and allostatic load is crucial in understanding and addressing these disparities. Chronic stress and allostatic load, which encompasses the cumulative physiological toll of stress on the body, have been linked to both CVD and breast cancer outcomes. Moreover, racial and ethnic minorities often face disproportionate levels of stress due to social determinants of health, including systemic racism, socioeconomic disadvantage, and limited access to quality healthcare. These stressors can contribute to the development and progression of both diseases and exacerbate existing health disparities.","Project Purpose(s)

It is hypothesized that there will be a significant relationship between race/ethnicity, allostatic load, perceived stress, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among breast cancer survivors. Specifically, it is expected that racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black and Hispanic individuals, will exhibit higher levels of allostatic load and perceived stress and experience poorer cardiovascular disease outcomes compared to White individuals.

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1- Can we use All of Us data to calculate the cardiovascular pooled score? We want to use and utilize the unique data collected by the All of Us program including smoking information, underrepresented race data, and  measurement values such as blood pressure and cholesterol to calculate the score.
2- Can we identify the scores that we calculate within a year of enrollment? We wanted to know the participants who might have cardiovascular risk score within the time enrollment. This will help the program quantify the importance of collecting longitudinal data for participants.
3- Will the risk score per race group be different? We compared the risk scores in each racial groups to quantify if some racial groups have higher or lower risk scores.

For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity and importance of the data collected by the program and can be challenging to extract from medical records (smoking status) by showing by calculating the cardiovascular risk within 10 years. We expect to find: 1) the easiness in using data from different sources (EHR and survey data) to build a model or calculate a risk. 2) the heterogeneity in All of Us population where underrepresented population in clinical trials or clinical data set are more present in the All of Us  3) the cardiovascular risk score is different in racial groups.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers. In response to FNIH RFP2 “GENERATION of New genetic, -omic, or biomarker data for Common Metabolic Diseases,” we propose to generate and discover novel genetic associations in the All of Us Research Program.","Project Purpose(s)

We will report counts and power calculations that describe the genetic associations that could be discovered in the All of Us Cohort.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition consisting of lifelong elevated LDL cholesterol levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Variants in three genes involved in LDL receptor function, LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, account for most cases. Among Western populations, the prevalence of FH has been reported to be between 1:212 to 1:331.  African ancestry individuals are underrepresented in submissions to genetic resources used to determine variant pathogenicity and there are no known reports on the prevalence of FH in those populations. Therefore, the study aims to create an African ancestry cohort to assess frequency of FH variants and outcomes such as LDL levels, use of lipid-lowering medications, and ASCVD risk among individuals in this cohort to better understand the burden of FH in this population.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to run ADMIXTURE on  genetic data from  All of Us  and other large multi-ethnic cohorts to create an African ancestry cohort. We then will assess sequence variants in the three FH genes from this cohort for pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Finally we will compare outcomes such as lipid levels , use of lipid lowering medications, and ASCVD risk  among those with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, a VUS, and without any such variant.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate finding several variants in the three known FH genes that are rare and/or poorly characterized in primarily European ancestry cohorts that confer increased risk for high LDL levels and ASCVD risk. We expect that many of the individuals with these variants will have not been adequately screened and treated for FH, and thus represent a population that could see benefits in care and lifespan with increased testing for FH variants and LDL cholesterol levels earlier in life.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In recent years, the biomedical research community has become more aware of the potential influence that a set of non-medical factors have on health outcomes (Marmot et al. 2008). Such social determinants of health (SDOH) are comprised of the conditions in which people work and live, including income, education, food security, early childhood development, social inclusion, etc. Recently, an association was observed between SDOH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients (Vinter et al. 2022). However, whether the link between SDOH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is causal and, in which direction, remains to be seen. This study is important because a statistical correlation between two variables can be explained by multiple underlying causal networks and knowledge of the causal network can help focus research and healthcare delivery.","Project Purpose(s)

We will develop a list of confounders, SDOH exposures of interest and outcomes of adverse cardiovascular conditions / events, based on a literature review and evaluation of the data available to us. We will formulate these into a series of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) per exposure-outcome model.
We will begin transforming and building our analytic dataset. We will make use of the various tools AllOfUs provides via Workbench platform. These tools include: Workspaces, R and Python, Dataset Builders and Cohort Builders.
We will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA).
We will then calculate propensity score models and employ inverse probability weighting (IPW) to weight regression models. Doubly robust methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) can be explored. Alternative to TMLE, a factor analysis can be performed on various SDOH and demographic survey measures available. These aggregate factors could then be utilized as exposures in our IPW regression models.","Anticipated Findings
Ideally, this study will answer the following question: What is the strength and direction of the causal relationship between multiple SDOH exposures and adverse cardiovascular outcomes? Currently, many SDOH exposures are associated with a variety of poor medical outcomes. We expect our models to show that some SDOH exposures do not causally influence adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and that other factors do have a causal influence and to what magnitude. Knowledge of the underlying causal structure can help focus public policy and healthcare delivery on SDOH factors that really matter to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease(s).","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to investigate and compare the contribution of cardiovascular disease risk factors on CVD outcomes among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that premenopausal women who are non-diabetic are protected against CVD in comparison to age-matched males. But the differences attenuated among post-menopausal women who were not on hormone replacement therapy. Menopause is associated with high blood pressure, high BMI, dyslipidemia and cholesterol accumulation and also associated with decrease in estrogen indicating that menopause and hormone status can account for the observed sex-differences. Here, we will explore the age-related differences in contributions of CVD risk factors among women. This will inform and support clinicians, scientist and public health professionals on clinically meaningful age-related differences and create awareness for prevention of CVD.","Project Purpose(s)

Treatment outcomes for cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are disproportionally poorer among racial and ethnic
minority patients. Black/African American (BAA) hypertension patients are less likely to have their blood pressure
controlled as compared to non-Hispanic White (nHW) patients. Nonadherence to the medications used for
treating CMDs is one of the major reasons for these observed disparities because optimal adherence to CMD
medications (antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic) is associated with 20-38% lower risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. BAAs, compared with non-Hispanic Whites (nHWs), are 37-80% less likely to
fully adhere with these CMD medications. The public health and economic burden of nonadherence to CMD
medications is steep. Thus, nonadherence is a major determinant of the disproportionately high burden of CVDs
among racial and ethnic minority populations in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.

Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Statins are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications that significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk patients. However, medication nonadherence, often attributed to reported side effects such as muscle pain, remains a significant barrier to their effectiveness. Genetic variations in the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene, responsible for encoding organic anion transporter polypeptide 1b1 (OATP1B1) and facilitating statin uptake into tissues, may impact statin efficacy and safety. Decreased statin concentrations can lead to reduced effectiveness in lowering LDL-C levels, while increased systemic exposure increases the risk of muscle-related symptoms. This study seeks to assess the influence of the rs4149056 (SLCO1B1*5) genotype on statin switching, discontinuation, and the incidence of clinical events such as myopathy and major adverse cardiovascular events.","Project Purpose(s)

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concern. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications for CKD and DM. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities. The study will also use predictive tools such as machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes in diabetes patients such as Uncontrolled Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications. particularly, the level of glycemic control will be predicted using machine learning approach.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced. The early prediction of glycemic level will also help to prevent complications and to improve quality of life of diabetes patients.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Up to 1 in 12 people worldwide is estimated to suffer from hearing loss, with 38 million Americans among them. Currently approved therapy for hearing loss in all its varieties is limited to sound amplification or surgical implants for those with more severe hearing loss. The effect of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockade, a target of anti-hypertensive medications, in human hearing loss has not been extensively explored. Age related hearing loss, or presbycusis, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, with hypertension serving as a predictor of faster rates of hearing decline. RAS-targeted treatments have the potential for system-wide vasoprotective effects and thus preserve hearing. To establish the RAS as a therapeutic target, we propose to examine the effect angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on development and progression of hearing loss using the AllofUs patient database.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Explore for an association of treatment with RAS-blockers and rates of hearing loss diagnoses among all patients who underwent treatment with anti-hypertensive medications. This query will compare two groups with otherwise similar baseline characteristics: 1) patients with a hypertension diagnosis who underwent pharmacotherapy for the treatment of hypertension with one or more of several common medication classes (diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers), versus 2) patients with hypertension who underwent treatment with ACEis or ARBs. These groups will be assessed for differences in the frequency of diagnostic codes for hearing loss (e.g. ICD 9 code 389.1 and 389.2), levels of hearing loss defined by audiometry (mild, moderate, severe, or profound), and for frequency of cochlear implantation (e.g. ICD 9 codes 20.96 to 20.98).","Anticipated Findings
We expect these comparisons to provide important information regarding the protective benefits of agents targeting the classical RAS as a novel otoprotective approach. These studies will have a positive impact and clinical relevance since they will inform future animal studies and human clinical trials regarding the use of existing, well-established medications for a novel indication of the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. They may also provide more substantial evidence of the benefit of these established pharmacologic strategies in treating other common microvascular and macrovascular diseases. Additionally, they may spur further investigation into novel therapies targeting the protective axis within the RAS (e.g. ACE2 activators, Ang-(1-7) or AT2R agonists). This is consistent with our long-term goal to aid in the translation of research of the ear’s endogenous protective systems into bedside therapeutics for patients at risk of hearing loss.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment. As predicting treatment response is complex and involves multiple different factors, the All of Us cohort provides a unique opportunity to study all these factors and use them to create a ML algorithm.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I plan on exploring the All of Us dataset to identify the number of participants taking antipsychotics, and the ways in which drug response can be defined for them. It will be important to have long-term response data for the participants. Once a cohort has been created, I will analyze it using machine learning tools such as support vector machines and random forest, which are supervised machine learning methods. Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups. We will explore to what extent there is a shared genetic basis for the cooccurrence of heart and brain disease, and whether this persists across ancestries.","Project Purpose(s)

We will conduct ancestry specific genome-wide association studies of heart and brain traits, and apply genetic colocalization to identify genetic mutations which may be a common cause of these diseases. We will consider straightforward case control analyses, as well as analyses accounting for age of onset, and disease trajectories considering the order of events. We will not exclude individuals based on sex, race, or ancestry, and rather determine consistence across these subgroups.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify genetic loci associating with heart and brain traits, aiming to uncover potential novel biological pathways which may put people at risk of early worsening of heart and brain health.

We are interested in identifying possible health disparities related to the onset of cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke) and socioeconomic variables that induce or contribute to acute and chronic stress. It is well established that the environment plays a role in the maintenance of cardiovascular function and possible dysfunction due to physiological and inflammatory responses to stressors.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population. Mounting evidence indicates that this impact disproportionately affects minority populations. Most factors underlying these health disparities pertain to the social determinants of health, but it is unclear how biological factors play a role or interact with these social determinants. The main questions of this study are: (1) can we use All of US to identify novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are specific to a given minority group? (2) Are existing risk factors for CVD shared across all minority groups? (3) Can we disentangle the contributions of social determinants of health and biological factors contributing to cardiovascular disease?

We will use the All of US dataset V5. We will identify variables that represent (1) cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke); (2) all the known risk factors for each of these conditions; (3) physiological variables that either define a risk factor or are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A1C); (4) polygenic risk scores for these conditions and their corresponding risk factors; and (5) identify the underrepresented groups of interest. We will use linear and logistic regression to test for association between risk factors, social determinants of health, genomic risk scores, and the conditions of interest, and product terms to test for effect modification between contributor variables.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that: (1) a substantial number of the known vascular risk factors increase risk of cardiovascular disease across all evaluated groups; (2) both social determinants of health and polygenic susceptibility are independently associated with these cardiovascular conditions; and (3) there are interactions between the effect of social determinants of health and polygenic contribution to disease.

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment. As predicting treatment response is complex and involves multiple different factors, the All of Us cohort provides a unique opportunity to study all these factors and use them to create a ML algorithm.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry
Other Purpose (I will be using genetic, lifestyle and clinical data from participants taking antipsychotics to develop a machine learning algorithm that can combine the effects of these factors to predict drug response and side effects)","Scientific Approaches
I plan on exploring the All of Us dataset to identify the number of participants taking antipsychotics, and the ways in which drug response can be defined for them.  It will be important to have long-term response data for the participants. Once a cohort has been created, I will analyze it using machine learning tools such as support vector machines and random forest, which are supervised machine learning methods. Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We wish to investigate what are there are genetic determinants or risk factors of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is a common infertility disorder affecting approximately 8-13% of women who are of reproductive-age. While common, PCOS is also a complex and multifactorial disease without a clear genetic cause. PCOS overlaps with other diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndromes. It is not clear if these associated diseases are caused by or are consequences of PCOS, or if PCOS and these other disease collectively have a common cause. In addition, women with PCOS have negative body image perceptions, low self-esteem, depression, and decreased quality of life. There is a need to increase knowledge surrounding the risk factors and determinants of PCOS to improve risk identification, disease diagnosis, and disease treatment and management options.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (polycystic ovary syndrome)

In order to determine what genetic risk factors are contributing to PCOS, we plan to explore genetic variants in women with PCOS to women without PCOS. After identifying any genetic variants, we will look at candidate genes more closely and see if there are any functionally relevant mutations when comparing the two groups. We will explore PCOS correlations in different cohort groups such as age, genetic ancestry, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, geography, if applicable. We will also look at correlations of the genetics between PCOS and other diseases starting with known associated diseases such like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. We plan to create summary statistics and graphical visualizations of our results to include in research presentations and peer-reviewed research articles.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate that our findings will identify candidate genetic determinants of PCOS in women with PCOS overall and will help us identify subpopulations of PCOS. Current clinical practices for predicting and treating PCOS are limited and we hope that knowledge gained from our study with All of Us data will lead to an increased understanding of PCOS etiology. By working with the All of Us data, we hope to identify genetic risk factors and possibly other risk factors (hormonal, lifestyle, and environmental) for women with PCOS in order to predict risk and improve diagnosis.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Obesity is a growing national epidemic that is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular mortality and disability. Studies have shown that dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis is related to metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. We are interested in the role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex in obesity. The MCU complex is the key regulator of mitochondrial calcium signaling; functional defects of MCU causes dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis.

The conditions in these subpopulations are often reported more when it comes to drug and/or alcohol abuse or mental illnesses. But why? Why isn't the playing field leveled to where all people can have access to information that may be vital to their health if not access to insurance and the proper care?

This study will primarily investigate whether a multidimensional whole health index, integrating measures of physical, mental, social, environmental, and financial well-being, offers a more robust prediction of chronic disease risk – including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers – within the ""All of Us"" cohort compared to traditional risk models that often rely heavily on clinical factors. Additionally, the research will explore if and how disparities across demographic groups (age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) are reflected in variations in these whole health metrics and whether these variations potentially explain differences in chronic disease burden.   A successful outcome could enhance chronic disease prediction capabilities, empowering healthcare providers with more accurate tools for early intervention and personalized prevention strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
My research methods will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation matrices to gain a comprehensive understanding of data distributions and relationships among variables.  Operationalizing whole health domains into quantifiable metrics will be crucial (for example, using survey scores validated for mental health assessment ). Factor analysis will be employed to reduce dimensionality within the dataset. Regression analysis will then determine the relationships between the whole health index and chronic disease outcomes while controlling for confounding factors. Finally, I'll leverage machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks, to enhance predictive capabilities, identify key features, and effectively model complex interactions","Anticipated Findings
The overarching hypothesis is that the multidimensional whole health index will significantly outperform traditional risk models for chronic disease prediction. Additionally, it's anticipated that certain whole health domains might emerge as particularly strong predictors for specific chronic diseases (e.g., the role of social isolation in cardiovascular health). Crucially, the study aims to unveil how variations in whole health metrics align with patterns of chronic disease distribution across demographic groups, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms driving health disparities. These findings have the potential to revolutionize how we approach chronic disease risk assessment, going beyond isolated risk factors to a more holistic and personalized framework. The identified key whole health metrics will pinpoint crucial areas for targeted interventions at both the individual and population health level.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The association between participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and improved cardiovascular outcomes, including reductions in recurrent cardiovascular events, readmissions, mortality, and depression and anxiety is well described. Previous studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic differences in CR participation, as well as the influence of socioeconomic factors on differences in participation in CR between racial and ethnic groups. Few studies have explored racial differences in CR outcomes, as well as the impact of other social factors, including household composition, primary language, health literacy, and employment status, on CR participation. Identifying these factors can allow for the timely and targeted development of interventions to increase initiation of CR, especially among minority populations, and improve long term outcomes of cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
I plan to perform a retrospective cohort study on adults ≥18 years with first time CR-qualifying diagnoses per ICD coding, with qualifying individuals grouped into CR initiation and non-initiation groups. Bivariate associations will be made between the two groups based on characteristics including race, copayment, primary language, household composition, and employment status, with a t test used for continuous variables and a chi-square test for categorical variables. Groups will be compared CR initiator and non-initiators will also be compared for overall survival, and then stratified by racial differences. A logistic regression model will also be constructed to to predict CR initiation as a function of variables including race, copayment, primary language, household composition, and employment status.","Anticipated Findings
Given that participation in CR has been historically and significantly lower in Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations compared to White individuals, further exploration into the socioeconomic factors that influence racial differences in utilization of CR services and their possible ramifications on long-term mortality and other clinical endpoints is urgently warranted.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Objective: To investigate whether neighborhood-level measures of socioeconomic status, built environment, social cohesion, and access to resources are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse cardiovascular outcomes among pregnant women.
Data Sources: We will leverage multiple data sources from the All of Us research program:
Participant surveys, Electronic health records, Census and administrative data linked at the census tract level
Outcomes: Primary - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia)
Secondary - Peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, stroke, myocardial infarction
Analysis Plan: We will use multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations between quartiles of neighborhood-level variables and cardiovascular outcomes, adjusting for individual confounders. Interaction terms will assess effect modification by individual-level socioeconomic status.","Project Purpose(s)

Descriptive Analysis: We will examine the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors, conditions, and outcomes among pregnant women in the cohort using summary statistics. These will include body mass index, chronic hypertension, diabetes, smoking, insurance status and others.
Outcomes: The primary outcome will be hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes are peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, stroke, and myocardial infarction.
Main Analysis: We will fit logistic regression models to estimate the associations between neighborhood-level economic, social, and environmental exposures (independent variables) and cardiovascular outcomes (dependent variables), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity and other relevant confounders. Effect modification by individual SES will be assessed.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show treatment patterns using data and electronic health records from different sites across the country. We expect to find (1) variation in the medication sequences prescribed to treat All of Us participants who have type 2 diabetes and hypertension; (2) the most common medication used to treat participants as the first line therapy for type 2 diabetes and hypertension; (3) a trend or change over time in what is/are the most common medication(s) prescribed first over the study period; and (4) trend or change overtime for the percentage of participants who were treated using only one medication class (monotherapy). Importantly, the detailed code developed will be made available within the Researcher Workbench, so other researchers may more easily extract medication data and class information using a common medication ontology.

Are there specific genetic variants associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients with diabetes?
What is the prevalence of cardiovascular genetic risk factors among the diabetic Hispanic population?
Studying genetic variations linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes individuals, especially in the Hispanic community, is essential for progressing personalize care and improving health outcomes. Identifying distinct genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is the first step in developing personalized prevention and treatment approaches, especially in minority groups like US Hispanics. Further, a better understanding genetic predisposition may improve our biological understanding of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and facilitate specific therapies to lessen the burden of cardiovascular problems in this at-risk population.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Cohort selection: Create cohort of diabetic patients in the All of Us program. We will then identify patients who develop the outcome of interest (the presence of cardiovascular disease [CVD]).  Data collection: Data will be collected from the All of Us database. The data should include demographic details, clinical parameters, individuals' genetics and outcomes related to diabetes and CVD.
Generating Descriptive statistics of the population:
Statistical Analysis: The use of statistical software (eg. Python) to generate descriptive statistics for the diabetes cohort. It will include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
Candidate gene study to identify if candidate SNPs (rs6923761, rs57922, rs9299870) are associated with risk of CVD in diabetes patients. This will involve the association of these SNPs within cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings: Specific genetic variations, interacting with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling system, provide a complex risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We anticipate that genetic variations in the GLP-1 signaling system may impact the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists by affecting insulin production, glucose metabolism, and atherosclerosis as well as overall cardiovascular risk. The study's findings are anticipated to improve our comprehension of why specific diabetes patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and how their reaction to therapy can differ depending on genetic factors. This method not only seeks to enhance scientific understanding but also strives to tackle healthcare inequalities and enhance public health results by customizing interventions to suit the unique requirements of individual patients, according to their genetic makeup.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is crucial for effective intervention and personalized medicine. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged as a promising tool for identifying individuals at high risk of developing CVD and other complex diseases. However, challenges exist in the utilization of PRS. Most PRS studies primarily focus on common variants, overlooking the potential contributions of rare variants, especially in intron and regulatory regions. Moreover, the portability of PRS to other ancestral populations, beyond European descent, is limited. To tackle these challenges this study will explore the impact of rare variants in the exon, intron and regulatory regions and its addition to PRS. By addressing these limitations, this study aims to improve prediction and risk assessment, thereby facilitating advancements in precision medicine and early intervention strategies.","Project Purpose(s)

Gout is an inflammatory metabolic disease affecting > 4% of US adults, including > 9% of those over age 65.  People with gout can experience very painful and disabling attacks (flares) in their joints and are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.
Gout results from high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricaemia) and studies by our group and others have identified many environmental, clinical, and genetic factors associated with gout. These include diuretic medications (increased risk), and coffee and vitamin C (decreased risk).  However, despite evidence that gout is having a greater impact on men and women in non-White racial groups in the US, most factors were identified in people of self-reported White race.
To address these gaps, we are exploring the AllofUs data to plan future studies on the environmental, genetic, and clinical factors associated with gout (or worse gout outcomes) in women and men of different racial/ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate using the EHR data and self-reported survey data to classify participants’ gout status and uric acid levels.

We anticipate using logistic regression models to evaluate the association between exposures and the risk of gout or hyperuricemia, adjusting for well-established gout risk factors such as overweight/obesity and use of diuretic medications.  We will also assess for joint effects and interactions between exposures, including genetic exposures drawn from the Genomics dataset.  For example, our prior analysis of a different cohort of mainly White adults found that excess BMI can exacerbate the impact of carrying certain hyperuricemia genes on the risk of gout.  Mediation analysis will be performed to quantify factors influencing sex- or racial differences in the burden of gout.","Anticipated Findings

Another hypothesis is that more complex machine learning methods such as GBM will have a better performance than traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression, without compromising scientific rigor.

The relationship between common behavioral risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and physical activities with cardiovascular diseases has been well described. However, it is noted that the higher misclassification and missingness on those factors from self-report source is observed, compared with demographic factors or biomarkers. There has been numerous methods developed to account for these measurement error such as imputation and re-classification based on clustering method. In this study, we aim at investigating the whether the use of polygenic risk score of behavioral risk factors could help refine the prediction of cardiovascular diseases, with or without controlling for self-reported data of those risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

For this project, behavioral risk factor measurements, basic demographic variables,  biomarker covariates such as blood pressure and BMI and history of cardiovascular - related disease would be needed. Also, we would need information on the genotype.
We would first construct a sparse polygenic risk score for various types of behavioral risk factors based on significant loci found in the All of US population and/or previous genome-wide association studies. Lasso regression and random survival forest would be applied to select the best set of PRS. Then we would apply PRS in the prediction of CVD along with other covariates, to investigate the improvement of prediction brought by the inclusion of behavioral risk factor PRS, in multi-ancestry population.","Anticipated Findings
We assume that the inclusion of behavioral risk factor PRS could help refine the prediction of the cardiovascular diseases, especially for behavioral traits that has relatively high heritability pattern.

We aim to assess metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity among minoritized groups and if patterns of severity are different between sub-groups, to derive separate severity scores by group. We will further assess roles of SDOH in worsening severity between groups and evaluate long-term risk prediction for future CVD—all with the goal of providing detailed guidance for researchers and healthcare providers for CVD preventative care.
To these ends, we aim to answer the following questions:
-	Are there differences in MetS manifestation among marginalized groups?
-	If there are differences, how do severity scores derived within a group compare to those previously derived?
-	What are the relationships between MetS severity and SDOH?

Using the Controlled level v7 data to access EHR data from each participant, we will use confirmatory factor analysis of MetS components among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender sub-groups and assess how these differ from prior estimates, deriving group-specific MetS z-scores. Sub-groups will be assessed for differences in correlations between SDOH data and MetS severity. Finally, we will assess CVD and T2D, including new diagnosis and mortality relative to MetS z-scores at multiple time points.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that MetS manifests differently among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender subgroups, warranting derivation of separate MetS-Z scores to guide identification and treatment for MetS-related risk. We further hypothesize that a large portion of this risk is related to SDOH burden in minoritized groups. In all sub-groups, we expect that higher scores will predict new disease outcomes. Deriving MetS-Z scores for each sub-group would enable more specific clinical assessment of future disease risk by sub-group.

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the industrialized nations. Countries with emerging economies are also facing increasing burden of cardiovascular disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) shares many common traditional risk factors with CVD.  These risk factors are growing in the community along with increasing burden of CVD and CKD.
Several predictive models are in clinical practice to stratify cardiovascular risk in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple studies suggest chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes and increased rate of cardiovascular events. However, there is a lack of consensus in using renal impairment as one of the predictor variables in assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with CVD. We propose to develop a comprehensive model incorporating renal function as one of the predictor variables which may improve the predictive accuracy of existing cardiovascular risk prediction models.","Project Purpose(s)

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, affecting an estimated 75 million people. This number is expected to increase to 110 million by the year 2040. Both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the two most common forms of glaucoma, disproportionately affect racial minorities in comparison to Whites in the United States. Allostatic load is a measurement that draws upon multiple bodily systems (cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, neuroendocrine) to estimate a person’s physiologic stress and allostatic coping mechanisms. Drivers of allostatic load include any chronic stressors, such as occupational stress, social isolation, and racial discrimination. Prior studies have linked other systemic diseases to allostatic load, but specific association between allostatic load and glaucoma has only been inferred.

The objectives of this study are to assess trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) and trajectories of physical activity separately among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) of color, heterosexuals of color, in comparison to White sexual and gender minorities, as well as White heterosexuals.
A secondary aim of this study is to assess how trajectories of physical activity are associated with changes in HRV among SGM and heterosexuals of color. SGM are shown to have higher rates of harmful cardiometabolic health behaviors when compared to cisgender heterosexuals.
The final aim of this study is to cross-sectionally investigate if physical activity mediates the association between discrimination and HRV among SGM and heterosexuals. Exposure to discrimination may lead to increased cardiovascular risk through behavioral and physiological pathways such as unhealthy coping behaviors or blunted diurnal cortisol slopes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The present study plans to utilize most of the data available through All of Us which contains electronic health records, biological specimen measurements, and Fitbit measurements. This also includes demographic characteristics of participants such as age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race. Survey measurement data will also be included such as depressive symptoms, and discrimination. Covariates of cardiovascular disease will also be investigated such as familial history of a heart disease, tobacco use, alcohol use frequency, and other substance use. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured through the Fitbit data available and will be treated appropriately with established methods. HRV will be explored through multiple measures such as resting heart rate (interbeat interval), differences between heartbeats, low-frequency (LF) power, and high-frequency (HF) power.
Researchers will investigate trajectories with a longitudinal perspective.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that SGM of color will have faster decreasing trajectories of HRV and physical activity compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Additionally, we predict that decreasing trajectories of physical activity will be associated with poorer trajectories of cardiometabolic health, with associations pronounced for SGM of color compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Lastly, we hypothesize that greater exposure to discrimination will be associated with decreased physical activity which results in lower HRV among SGM, especially those of color.
The findings of this study will contribute to the current emerging field of sexual and gender minority health. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and this effect is more pronounced for individuals in possession of a minority identity. Findings will provide an additional look into how discrimination affects CVD risk among racial and ethnic groups of SGM.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose of this proposed study is to examine the association between lifetime Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and overall cardiovascular health, including prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). There is a growing amount of data that suggests a long-term relationship between PTSD and cardiovascular health, cardiovascular risk factors, risk for CVD events, and CVD prognosis. However, most studies investigated the association between PTSD and an individual CVD risk factor or behavior separately, and few studies investigated overall cardiovascular health. As a result, the evidence of the association between PTSD and overall cardiovascular health, including all major CVD risk factors and behaviors, has not been reported. Therefore, this study aims to answer if PTSD is related to increased overall cardiovascular risks.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (PTSD and cardiovascular diseases)","Scientific Approaches
For defining groups, we will use the ICD-10 codes for PTSD and CVD. We will also utilize some relevant variables to generate cardiovascular health, comprising four risk factors and behaviors. The overall cardiovascular score is the unweighted average of the 8 component metric scores, ranging from 0 to 100. For analysis, compare overall cardiovascular health scores between PTSD and non-PTSD groups.","Anticipated Findings

We will evaluate the general epidemiology for e-cigarette use and we will study the relationships with other key variables having to do with life stressors of other lifestyle habits.  Besides, we will explore whether e-cig use can lead to cardiovascular health effects.
E-cigarette use has gained popularity, with the patterns of use changing rapidly, raising concerns about its potential health consequences. By studying the current epidemiology and investigating the relationship between e-cigarette use and other lifestyle traits, we can shed light on the overall health implications of e-cigarette use. Moreover, exploring the association between e-cigarette use and incident hypertension is critical due to the growing prevalence of both e-cigarette use and hypertension, particularly in young individuals. Understanding this potential link can guide public health policies, healthcare strategies, and health education efforts to mitigate hypertension-related risks among e-cigarette users.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the extensive All of Us dataset as our primary data source. With its diverse participant pool and comprehensive data on demographics and health-related variables, the dataset offers a robust foundation for our research. We intend to utilize relevant baseline variables, including e-cigarette use, lifestyle variables including psychological stressors, and baseline hypertension status. The analyses for our first aim will be cross-sectional, employing logistic regression and related methods. For the second aim, we will ascertain incident health status – specifically incident hypertension – from the data derived from linked EHR files. These analyses will employ Cox proportional hazards regression and related survival analysis techniques. Our team's multidisciplinary expertise equips us to conduct and oversee rigorous analysis. In addition to our primary research questions, we will broaden our analysis to encompass other health outcomes related to e-cigarette use.","Anticipated Findings
The study aims to explore plausible associations between e-cigarette use, and other lifestyle patterns including other tobacco use and illicit drug use, psychosocial stressors, and incident hypertension, leveraging the All of Us dataset. The anticipated outcomes may unveil correlations and associations between e-cigarette use and heightened psychosocial stress levels, coupled with an increased risk of developing hypertension. These findings could expand our current understanding of the health implications of e-cigarettes, potentially guiding proactive strategies and targeted interventions. The results have the potential to enhance scientific insights by untangling the intricate pathways linking e-cigarette use, psychosocial determinants, and the occurrence of hypertension. As a result, this contribution could inform evidence-driven approaches in public health, potentially stimulating further exploration within this rapidly evolving research domain.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1) What is the prevalence of different types of cardiovascular disease in people with cancer?
2) What types of cardiovascular disease are associated with specific types of cancer treatment?
3) Are there genetic variants associated with cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease?
These questions are important because the number of cancer survivors is projected to reach 30 million by 2030 and there are increased rates of cardiovascular disease in patients treated for cancer compared to patients who were not treated for cancer. Capability to identify which patients are at risk of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease would allow early intervention with cardioprotective strategies. If there is a genetic component to cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease, genetic profiling could be used to 1) Identify at risk patients prior to treatment; 2) Better understand the the mechanism of toxicity, 3) Develop new cardioprotective drugs.","Project Purpose(s)

I intend to uncover genomic variants that are linked to cardiac shape measuerements. My primary purpose is to investigate quantitatively how changes in heart shape affect different patients' cardiovascular disease outcomes. Are these changes in heart shape also explained by genomic variants? Exploring these differences can aid in diagnosis and treatment of diffeerent cardiovascular disease phenotypes. For example, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients have markably different symptoms. A major difference in diagnosis can be due to a patient's underlying genetic makup of the heart. This connection is something we also hope to look into further.","Project Purpose(s)

I plan to use the whole genome sequencing datasets. I plan to use plink and structural variant callers to impute genomic SNPs and SVs that are correlated to shape measurements. I believe AllofUs has shape measurement data out there, including mass, volume, and ejection fraction measuremnts of the heart. If MRI data is also available, I plan to analyze images of the hearts. We have a pipeline developed to take several different guide points and landmarks in MRIs to characterize heart shape. We use the basic measurements and then use dimensional reduction to get a set of normalized principal components for each patient. I will then use a sort of GWAS or some other association method to correlate the genomic variants and heart shape measurements.

The primary scientific inquiry we aim to investigate revolves around ascertaining whether the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents yields additional cardiovascular benefits in comparison to the inhibition of either target in isolation, particularly in high-risk patients.
This research question holds significant importance as prevailing guidelines advocate for a more intensive management approach for type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. However, a substantial number of these patients struggle to attain the recommended treatment targets, even with maximal therapy. By examining the combined effects on blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation through the inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents , as demonstrated in this study, we intend to establish a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of a combined inhibitor approach.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes and CVD)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Dataset:
Utilize individual-level data from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD. Identify those at high risk who fail to achieve target blood glucose levels despite being on the maximum tolerated therapy for blood glucose reduction.
Methods:
Stratify participants based on genetic variants that are predictive of higher or lower levels. Subsequently, compare the rates of blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular events.
Analyses:
Utilize linear regression models to quantify the differences in blood glucose levels based on specific genotypes. Additionally, employ Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with different genotypes.
Test for interactions between genetic variants and the treatment effects of inhibitors on both blood glucose levels and clinical events.","Anticipated Findings
If genetic proxies confirm greater blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular benefit from blood glucose lowering variants, it would provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting combined pharmacological as a novel strategy for incremental risk reduction in high-risk patients, not at blood glucose goal. This would genetically validate the approach and inform the design of an outcomes trial directly comparing dual inhibition to individual inhibition alone","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will aim to identify the social service and support needs of individuals living in rural areas who have a history of CVD, or who are considered to be at high risk of developing CVD (i.e., hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, etc.). We will utilize a combination of survey questions and procedure concepts to identify rurality, while social needs will be identified using survey questions that relate to social determinants of health, healthcare access and utilization, lifestyle, and demographic indices. CVD and associated conditions will be identified using the EHR ""conditions"" domain (i.e., hypertensive heart disease, neurocirculatory asthenia, and ""at increased risk of cardiovascular disease""), the Labs & Measurements concept, and procedure concept ""Annual, face-to-face intensive behavioral therapy for CVD..."".

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow acquire somatic mutations that lead to overgrowth of a genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells. The prevalence of CHIP detectable through next-generation sequencing of blood DNA is up to 10% of adults >70 years and nearly 20% of adults >90 years.

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Aging-Related Diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians. The Li Lab here at UC Irvine uses a variety of computational methods to find different types of genomic patterns in an unbiased manner. With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging. Also, if we can find genetic reasons that explain why supercentenarians avoid aging-related diseases, we may even be able to identify therapeutic targets and treatments for these diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) has traditionally been viewed as a disease of men, new evidence suggests the existence of distinct differences in the risk factors, development, and outcomes between the two sexes.  For example, our recent studies have revealed that the genetic factors for several intermediate cardiometabolic traits, represent potentially novel sex-specific mechanisms for CVD. In addition to sexually dimorphic associations, we intend to build upon our research on variants specifically associated with myocardial infarction. This project proposes to build on our observations using genetic and clinical cardiometabolic phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (coronary artery disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
A series of analyses will be sex-stratified genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) for CVD-related binary traits in the full dataset.  For GWAS of discrete traits, we are interested in coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) as clinical outcomes. We will be using unbiased genetic analysis using whole genome sequencing data with statistical genetic analyses to uncover common and rare variants associated with discrete cardiometabolic clinical traits.","Anticipated Findings
Our previous studies have identified potentially novel sexually dimorphic mechanisms for the development of CVD. Although these results support the concept that the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease in women may differ from men, they also raise several important unanswered questions from a genetics perspective such as what are the mechanisms by which other loci in the genome influence plasma levels of metabolites and lipid species of interest and do they exhibit sexually dimorphic associations with CVD phenotypes?  Similarly, little is known about the genetic determinants that are specifically associated with MI among patients with CAD compared to those that drive atherogenesis. Although previous studies of ours have identified novel variants associated specifically with MI, we believe there are additional loci that are MI specific. Thus, identifying genes involved in the complex pathological processes leading to MI/plaque rupture could have important clinical implications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We Intend to study and understand the association of physical activity with cardiovascular diseases in participants with Fitbit data. There is a critical need to understand whether physical inactivity contributes to the disparity in cardiovascular disease in individuals of different racial/ethnic and sexual orientation/gender identity (SOGI) groups. By exploring the Fitbit data on AoU, we are aiming: 1) to see if there are ways we can use the Fitbit data to support the early detection of disease, such as early detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib); 2) to determine whether intense exercise can improve the resting heart rate; 3) to determine if the Fitbit data can be used to quantitively study the length of sleep; 4) to understand whether the heart rate and exercise level varies by race after adjusting for the social determinant of health (SDOH), lifestyle as well as demographic characteristics; 5) to investigate the interplay of physical activity, RHR and cardiovascular outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
There are four datasets we will use: EHR domains, physical measurement, Fitbit, and survey (lifestyle, family history, SDOH). Below are key research methods and tools: 1, To assess the association between the intensity of physical activity and resting heart rate (RHR), we will include all participants who shared Fitbit data. To predict the proportion of maximum heart rate on minute-level, we will use an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). To balance the interpretability and overfitting, we will conduct machine learning models, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive LSTM to estimate the outcome as secondary analysis. 2, To investigate the interplay of physical activity, RHR and cardiovascular outcomes, we will use Cox proportional hazard regressions to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary outcomes, MACE, among participants by intensity groups, adjusted for confounders at the index date.","Anticipated Findings
First, through this study, we can standardize the data collection process, which fills a gap on how to handle Fitbit data in retrospectives studies. Next, we might discover some specific heart rate patterns that are associated with the increase in AFib, which could lead to early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Furthermore, our study will provide a better understanding of disparities in cardiovascular diseases in vulnerable individuals with varied backgrounds, such as elderly, cancers, which may in turn, lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AFib, thus leading to further studies. With these potential findings, we could advance our understanding of the progression of CVD, and have the potential for clinical translation to precision CVD prevention, and reduce cardiovascular disparities in individuals in a personalized manner.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), encompassing conditions like stroke and heart attack, remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While traditional risk factors such as diet, exercise, and genetics are well-documented, the potential impact of novel environmental exposures, particularly lithium and pesticides, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge presents an urgent need for comprehensive research to understand these relationships better.
This research is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses a relatively unexplored area of environmental health. Understanding the role of lithium, commonly found in water supplies and used in various industries, and pesticides, widely used in agriculture, in the development of heart attacks and strokes could be significant in reducing the global burden of these diseases. Furthermore, this study could inform policy makers, guiding regulations on environmental exposures and public health advisories.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cerebrovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The study will employ an epidemiological approach, analyzing data from diverse populations to establish correlations between CVD incidence and levels of lithium and pesticide exposure. This will involve detailed environmental assessments, comprehensive medical histories, and possibly biomarker analyses to accurately quantify exposure levels. Advanced statistical methods will be used to control for confounding variables, ensuring the validity of the findings.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study could range from establishing a clear correlation between these novel exposures and increased CVD risk, to identifying no significant relationship. In cases where a positive association is found, the results could pave the way for further research into mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic interventions, and targeted public health strategies. Even in the absence of a significant association, the findings would be valuable in ruling out these exposures as major risk factors, refining the focus for future CVD research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Epidemiological evidence has shown climate change (including extreme heat and elevated temperature) and air pollution have adverse effects on population health, especially cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases.

The overall aim of this project is to investigate how climate change, air pollution and lifestyle are affecting cardiometabolic diseases among representative US population in the All of US program. First, we will investigate how climate-related extreme events and air pollution together impact cardiometabolic disease incidence and mortality.

Do higher rates of chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases in Black participants account for higher rates of pneumococcal vaccination among this group? Are there disparities among people with chronic diseases with regards to vaccination rates?
Immunizations are one of the most important and effective preventative health measures available, but relative to public health goals, are underutilized in adults. Developing a better understanding of how vaccines are used positions us to develop strategies to mitigate modifiable risk factors and improve vaccination rates. Results from our study will address a knowledge gap in understanding data characteristics available in the All of Us dataset for younger adult participants who have received pneumococcal vaccines. Results from this study is intended to provide us with stronger justification for access to medical and pharmacy claims data to develop prediction models on which variables have the highest amplitude of impact.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
The All of Us database will be used as a source population for a convenience sample in this cross-sectional study to characterize the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of adults who receive pneumococcal vaccines as adults.  These categories of factors will also be used to compare groups of participants who completed the hepatitis B and HPV vaccine series with those who started, but did not complete these vaccine series. Descriptive statistics, correlations and cross-tabulation will be used to describe specific differences in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, gender-based, and health- and lifestyle-related determinants of the use of vaccines in patients included in this unique database. Inferential analysis, including an emerging methodology intended to reduce the biasing effects of missing data will also be applied.","Anticipated Findings
This proposed study provides a cross-sectional evaluation of the All of Us program data to develop a baseline understanding of the relevant and available vaccination data. Most existing literature describing adult vaccination rates are based on self-reports and few focus on correlating health data. Comprehensive data regarding vaccination rates exist, but lack investigation to specific health, and sociodemographic characteristics. More importantly descriptions of vaccine studies have been mainly limited to individual vaccine types. This analysis is a follow up study of previous work utilizing the All of Us database which identified vaccination disparities consistent with the published literature. The use of bias reduction methods also has important implication for a variety of other research questions applied to large EHR databases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Heart failure (HF) is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease. It significantly reduces quality of life, results in frequent hospitalizations, and causes many deaths. Access to care is therefore critical for patients with heart failure in preventing morbidity and mortality. However, research on barriers to care in patients with heart failure is limited, especially for minority groups (sex and gender minority, racial and ethnic minority). This is an important area of study as addressing these disparities can lead to improved outcomes for heart failure patients.
Specifically, the questions are:
What are the barriers to healthcare access for minority groups with heart failure?
How do these barriers contribute to the disparities in heart failure outcomes among these groups?
What interventions can effectively reduce these barriers and improve access to care for all patients with heart failure","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
Our study will utilize a dataset of patients with heart failure, identified using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes. We will categorize these patients into two groups: those belonging to sex and gender minorities (SGM) — defined as individuals with one or more minoritized identities in relation to their sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or sexual orientation — and those identified as racial and ethnic minorities, based on self-reported race and ethnicity (e.g., American Indians, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders; Blacks; Hispanics). To analyze the data, we will employ multivariable logistic regression to explore the association between minority status and the experience of barriers to care.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate discovering that minority patients with heart failure face more substantial barriers to care, particularly in specific areas we aim to pinpoint. By identifying these critical zones, our findings will enable healthcare practitioners to target interventions more effectively and shed light on broader systemic issues affecting minority patients at both individual and institutional levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We aim to validate a new algorithm for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk within the All of Us research dataset. Specific questions we will ask are:
1. How does the new risk prediction algorithm perform regarding the calibration and discrimination among All of US dataset? Calibration refers to the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, while discrimination refers to the algorithm's ability to distinguish between individuals who will experience a CVD event and those who will not.
2. How does the performance of the new self-report algorithm compare to previous commonly used prediction models, such as the Framingham Risk Score, which require more measurements.
We hypothesize that the new algorithm for CVD events prediction will have good calibration and discrimination. Furthermore, we anticipate that the predictive capacity of this novel algorithm will be non-inferior to the traditional Framingham score.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
In this study, we will assess the predictive capability of a new algorithm developed by Huma Therapeutics Limited (London, United Kingdom) within the UK BioBank by using the All of Us dataset. To evaluate its performance, we will exclude participants who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. CVD in our study is defined as a composite outcome including myocardial infarction, heart failure, angina pectoris or other chronic ischemic disease, stroke, and transient ischemic attack.
To assess the predictive accuracy of the new algorithm, we will employ Cox's proportional hazards model and calculate the C-index and ROC AUC in STATA. Furthermore, we will conduct a comparison between the performance of the new algorithm and the Framingham score, a commonly used prediction model for CVD. This comparative analysis will provide insights into the relative effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to the established Framingham score.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we will evaluate the performance of the new algorithm. We expect to evaluate the calibration and discrimination of the new algorithm when applied to the All of Us dataset. By comparing the new algorithm's performance with the widely used Framingham score, we aim to determine if the new algorithm is non-inferior to the traditional prediction model in terms of prediction accuracy. This comparison will provide insights into the effectiveness and potential advantages of the new algorithm.
These findings of this study would contribute to the prediction of CVD by providing a potentially reliable tool for assessing CVD risk in the general population, and serving as an alternative or complementary tool for clinicians and researchers in assessing CVD risk. The progression in CVD prediction will assist in improving early recognition of CVD risk, enabling early interventions, and promoting","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the United States. Many cardiovascular diseases initiate with dysfunctional blood vessels leading to blockages, or occlusions. Our research group studies how dysfunction of the cells that line the inside of blood vessels, endothelial cells, can lead to the development of diseased blood vessels. We have previously identified a list of candidate proteins which we hypothesize may be important in regulating vessel health. While we study the role of these proteins using cell culture models, we plan to use the All of Us database to identify population-level genetic variations in our candidate proteins which lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases. By learning more about how genetics can change the function of endothelial cells and therefore blood vessel health, we can identify potential targets for pharmaceuticals to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Once we identify a correlation between a genetic mutation and a disease, we will validate that the mutation causes disease using cell culture and animal models.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to determine whether persons who carry mutations in our candidate proteins are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease in their lifetime.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in the United States. Despite this, only 44% of women surveyed in a 2019 American Heart Association survey were able to correctly identify CVD as the leading cause of death among women. Recently, there is growing recognition that sex-specific and reproductive factors including premature menopause and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase risk of CVD. This acknowledgement highlights the importance of CV risk modification and counseling in a population of women who were previously considered to be low risk for future CV events.

Do providers prescribe statins for hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 DM less often in patients with NASH than those without NASH?
PCP's are reluctant to prescribe statins to patient's with abnormal liver function tests because of the known risk of hepatotoxicity associated with statin use. However, statins have not only been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and type 2 Diabetes, but have also been proven to have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic properties and may thus inhibit progression from simple steatosis to fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
The goal of this study is to look at a diverse panel of patients to evaluate the prescribing patterns for statins in patients both with and without NASH and hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

Our goal is to examine differences in cardiovascular (CV) health between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM adults (ages 18 and over). Our primary aim is to assess differences in CV risk behaviors (such as tobacco use and physical activity), health factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol), and CV diagnoses (such as heart attack and stroke). We will also explore potential racial, ethnic, education, income, and geographic location differences CV health within SGM individuals. This project is led by Dr. Billy Caceres who is a CV nurse scientist and a nationally recognized expert on the CV health of SGM individuals. There is growing evidence showing that SGM adults are at greater risk for CV disease than non-SGM individuals. However, potential reasons for these differences are not understood. Findings of this analysis will inform future research and interventions that will focus on specific CV risk factors to improve the CV health of SGM adults.","Project Purpose(s)

Further, we hypothesize that these differences will be greater among SGM racial and ethnic minorities. We expect this work will inform future research that focuses on specific subgroups of SGM individuals that are most at risk for CV disease (such as bisexual or transgender individuals).

Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity. Despite the increasing use of GLP-1 RA, their impact on diabetic retinopathy remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence on the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most of this evidence stems from the multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs, which have defined DR differently. Most of the other studies have not been large enough to adequately answer this question. This study aims to investigate the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and DR and diabetic macular edema progression via the All of Us research database. We will also determine whether lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse access to GLP-1 RA and thus worse DR.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
To determine if there is an association between use of GLP-1 RAs and progression/presence of diabetic retinopathy (none/NPDR/PDR) or diabetic macular edema that required treatment in the form of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or corticosteroid (i.e., triamcinolone) injection, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Two cohorts: One on GLP-1 RA therapy and the other not on GLP-1 RA therapy. Only patients with type 2 DM. Patients should not have PDR prior to initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy. Patients should be treatment-naive (no prior intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy).
Covariates: Age at diagnosis of DM, sex, birth country, race/ethnicity, education level, insurance status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, smoking history, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI).
Multivariate logistic regression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that GLP-1 RA therapy is not associated with progression or presence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema that requires treatment in the form of intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy. As the literature currently has conflicting evidence on this question, we hope this study will provide further guidance on this matter. Additionally, we hope that this study will encourage primary care physicians and endocrinologists to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus aggressively to minimize all the associated systemic complications of diabetes mellitus including worsening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema from worsening control of blood glycemic levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Datasets: Fitbit accelerometry data; data regarding diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, blood glucose metrics, cholesterol metrics, and blood pressure.
Methods: We will use machine learning and statistical analysis methods for time-series data for this task
Tools: Python and R programming language, and relevant data analysis packages in these languages.","Anticipated Findings
Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will explore machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are at substantially increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.  A reliable predictive model could be very helpful for identifying individuals at the greatest risk so that they can modify lifestyle and health habits and their physicians can consider pharmacologic interventions and closer monitoring.
We are particularly interested in determining whether the model is as effective for historically underrepresented groups as it is for historically well represented groups.  Historically, medical studies examining prognostic predictors, including for cardiac health have focused on predominantly Caucasian populations and might not be as applicable to underrepresented minorities.

Can deep learning be applied to ECG data to detect those with arrhythmias of monogenic inheritance? Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for around half of cardiovascular deaths in the United States (US). SCD heritable risk factors contribute to the risk of SCD through monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS). However, routine clinical genomic testing of arrhythmias is inaccessible by its undetermined timeline for large scale employment, complicated by cost and requirement of expert interpretation at large scale. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical modality used to measure electrical activity of the heart, serving as a first-line diagnostic touchpoint for patients, with and without suspected cardiac abnormalities. This study proposes to leverage DL to identify ECG features that indicate monogenic risk of SCD using electronic health record (EHR) and ECG data.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Monogenic arrythmias)","Scientific Approaches
To improve the identification of monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes in individuals of diverse ancestry, I will use a deep learning architecture to classify those with genotype-positive disease using clinical and ECG data. This will require use of genomics, electronic health records (EHR), and ECG datasets and coding with SQL and Python in the Research Notebook. While models have been created to classify these different conditions independently, an algorithm has yet to be developed that will classify monogenic predisposition to arrhythmia, with appreciation for ancestry diversity. To determine algorithm utility, I will determine the proportion of individuals with a monogenic inherited arrhythmia diagnosis in their EHR to ascertain new detected cases.  I hypothesize that by integrating data from All of Us, this algorithm will apply widely to diverse populations.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to find a model that can increase selection of patients of diverse ancestry who are genotype positive for monogenic IAS. I will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine missed diagnoses not captured by EHR and number of averted SCD with earlier diagnosis. With access to longitudinal medical record information, I am well positioned to discover non-traditional ECG signatures of patients with monogenic IAS before episodes of SCA through explainability analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question: Is there a difference in antihypertensive drug usage among Black Americans and White Americans in the United States?
Null Hypothesis: There is a difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans in the United States?
Alternate Hypothesis: There is no difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans?
Methodology:
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants' demographics and T-Test will be used to determine the difference between Black Americans and White Americans and antihypertensive drugs.
The researcher planned to access data on ethnic groups diagnosed with hypertension and the usage of antihypertensive drugs. Numerous studies have indicated that black Americans die from hypertension more than white Americans and are diagnosed with the condition more than other races. The Researcher planned to investigate barriers that prevented blacks from using antihypertensive drugs.","Anticipated Findings
If blacks have knowledge about hypertension (knowing the appropriate blood pressure parameters, disease duration, and modifiable factors required for hypertension control) they may adhere to antihypertensive medications with the support system. Finding barriers that contribute to nonadherence to antihypertensive medications may help clinicians to adopt strategies to improve patients' care and well-being. Due to the racial disparities in healthcare and utilization of insurance, the researcher anticipates that Black Americans will not adhere to antihypertensive medications. The social determinants of health can also play a significant role and this can have a major impact on participant’s health, well-being, and quality of life.

Research Questions: What are the demographic features of individuals with elevated total homocysteine levels (tHcy)? What medical co-morbidities are associated with elevated tHcy? Are there genetic variants in the genes of homocysteine metabolism that play a role in plasma hyperhomocysteinemia?
Elevated tHcy is a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, thromboembolism, and neuropsychological symptoms. It can be caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, renal insufficiency, or rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMS). Rare IEMs involving homocysteine metabolism can remain undiagnosed due to limitations in newborn screenings, variable clinical presentations, and overall lack of awareness. This study will identify clinical characteristics of individuals with elevated l tHcy, and identify genetic variants in homocysteine metabolism. This can improve medical care.","Project Purpose(s)

In order to address these research questions, we will build two cohorts – one of individuals with elevated tHcy levels (defined as greater than 30 micromole per liter), and one of individuals with normal tHcy levels (defined as less than 15 micromole per liter). The dataset will include demographic information, dietary information, medical history, imaging data, surgical history, lab values, and DNA sequence data for each participant. The dataset will first be analyzed in R using linear and logistic regression analysis to determine if there is an association between these clinical variables and tHcy, which will serve as the predictor variable. If the cohort for individuals with elevated homocysteine is robust, we will proceed to conduct genetic variant analysis. This will be done using Python and assistance from the Research Hub.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that the prevalence of medical co-morbidities will increase with increasing homocysteine levels and that lab values will be more clinically severe with increasing homocysteine levels. These findings will help characterize the clinical presentation of individuals with elevated tHcy levels. Having a better understanding of the population-level characteristics of those with elevated tHcy will help raise awareness of and increase education on the clinical features and outcomes associated with varying levels of tHcy. This, in turn, could help improve detection and diagnosis of elevated tHcy and its underlying causes, thus promoting better prevention and treatment management for the associated clinical outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Neither genomics or environmental factors alone are sufficient for complete understanding of complex diseases, or adequately address health conditions or inequalities in health. All of Us with rich and high-quality data on genomics and environmental exposures provide opportunities to understand the interactions between genes and environment on health. Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.  Song and Zhang (2014) developed tree-based analysis of rare variants (TARV) to construct super-variants which combine genetic markers in any loci. With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find novel gene-environment interactions for complex diseases, and some examples of their implications/contributions include:
• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations. Using the measures of discrimination and/or racism in All of US, we can assess not only how the race may affect genetic-health associations, but also the role of racism, and broadly, the culture and social environments.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. As accessibility to molecular testing increases, genetic arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy conditions are increasingly diagnosed within families. Data on how individuals with genetic cardiac conditions fare during pregnancy is limited. We seek to address the following aims in order to improve prenatal counseling and pregnancy care of this group of patients.
1) In those individuals that develop peripartum cardiomyopathy, what proportion have a genetic predisposition for developing cardiac dysfunction.
2) How do pregnancy outcomes of individuals with genetic cardiomyopathy syndromes compare to the general population

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease.

Arab-Americans experience similar barriers in healthcare access as other ethnic minorities in the US, and tend to have worse health outcomes than caucasian patients. Moreover, Arab-Americans tend to experience a higher burden of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, unlike other minorities, Arab-Americans are classified as ""White"" on US census data as well as in most nationally representative health databases.
Given the unique challenges faced by Arab-Americans, this misguided data aggregation represents a costly missed opportunity to elucidate insights about the health status of Arab-Americans.
We intend to study the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases amongst Middle Eastern and North African identifying individuals, and contrast that with non-hispanic caucasian individuals, in order to elucidate differences in health status and ultimately demonstrate the importance of deaggregating MENA demographics data within healthcare system and databases.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
we will use epidemiological tools to assess whether there is a meaningful difference between MENA-Americans and non-hispanic white individuals in terms of baseline health status, burden of disease, access to healthcare, and health outcomes.
We will perform a retrospective cohort study, and run appropriate statistical analyses while controlling for potential confounding variables.","Anticipated Findings
We except to find a higher burden of disease amongst MENA-identifying individuals compare to non-hispanic white individuals, worse access to healthcare, and worse health outcomes. There is plenty of evidence within the MENA community about these disparities, yet the lack of a ""MENA"" demographic category has prevented these disparities from being validated through large, nationally representative databases. The ""All of Us"" database provides a unique opportunity for the MENA-identifying community to validate the challenges and struggles they have experienced for decades. This visibility and proper representation will be impactful in advocating healthcare systems and large public health databases to include a MENA demographic category, and will help the MENA-identifying community to advocate for and receive federal and local funding as well as appropriate public health interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are exploring the AllofUS data for correlations between Fitbit data (specifically, heart rate and steps) and cardiovascular outcomes. The initial question we pose is: Can Fitbit HR/step data and appropriate scaling of HR with activity be used as a predictor of CV disease and its complications? Participants will be grouped based on their HR at certain activity levels and whether HR is appropriately scaling with activity (i.e. low HR, low step count; low HR, high step count; high HR, low step count, etc.). Using EHR data, we plan to analyze which of these groups are at greatest risk for CV outcomes (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular hospitalization, death, etc.). Should this data be a predictor of the health outcomes described, this project may validate wearable technology's clinical utility in predicting/assessing CV disease. This will also answer a novel question regarding the appropriate scaling of HR with activity and its importance in cardiovascular health.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
To answer the question above, we plan to explore the Fitbit data, demographic data, and EHR data (including diagnoses, medications, hospitalizations, etc.) available in the AllofUS dataset to find associations with activity/HR and cardiovascular disease. Fitbit HR and step data will be linked, and participants' HR over various activity levels will be used to group them based on whether their HR is appropriately adjusting with activity level. Cardiovascular disease among these groups will then be compared. The availability/granularity of this data will ultimately determine the methods used to answer our question.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that certain groups from those above will be at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and complications from it. Specifically, we suspect that those who have inappropriately high HR without much activity, or those who have inappropriately low HR are at greater risk than those whose HR appropriately adjusts with activity. While other studies may have shown this, or similar correlations, seldom use data as granular as is possible with wearable fitness trackers. With these devices, minute-by-minute data is available for both steps and HR over the course of months to years. No other studies have used data this granular in examining appropriate HR rise/fall in response to activity and how this correlates with cardiovascular disease.

Lupus is an autoimmune disease when the body's immune system attacks its tissues and organs, causing widespread inflammation - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus became a global pandemic, and while there were many named co-morbidities- such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer, however, there was very little information about the association of COVID-19 and Lupus. Vaccines are well-studied medications to reduce and have even eliminated many diseases in the national population. As Lupus is an autoimmune disease, most medical professionals encourage their patients to get at least one of the available vaccines. Still, many African Americans, even those without Lupus, hesitated to get a vaccine. This study looks at the impact of Covid-19 infections on those diagnosed with Lupus and attitudes surrounding available vaccines.","Project Purpose(s)

The most common cause of death among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased cardiovascular risk in patients with SLE appears to be multifactorial. Traditional risk factors (such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and the inflammatory process intrinsic to SLE seem to contribute to the occurrence of arterial vascular events. Previous studies have performed cardiovascular risk stratification; however, the association by different ethnicities/races has not been evaluated.  We will use existing databases (OCHIN and local data) to generate harmonized datasets categorized by ethnicity to accomplish this. These datasets will be employed to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify combinations of factors (features) linked to CVD risk in patients with SLE among various ethnic groups, specifically for Caribbean Hispanics.","Project Purpose(s)

As a result, a list of factors (features) most relevant to CVD risk in SLE patients for each ethnicity/race group (including Caribbean Hispanics) will be obtained.  (To be completed by Q2 of the year)
In addition, several ML algorithms will be trained (i.e., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, others) to create models for predicting CVD risks in SLE patients grouped by ethnicity/race.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diseases of the heart and blood vessels, account for approximately 18 million deaths worldwide. Most genetic studies have disproportionately used individuals of European ancestry, leaving minority populations under-investigated. The increased availability of hyper-palatable foods, including foods rich in fat and sugar, is associated with the rapid rise in obesity, dyslipidemia, and CVD.  The present study attempts to 1) elucidate the potential dynamic biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to dyslipidemia and cardiometabolic diseases by combining genomics, exome, metabolomics, and phenome data and 2) identify if the dynamic biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to dyslipidemia are associated with taste-related genes and neural correlates of food preferences from neuroimaging data.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Demographic and covariate variables will include age, sex, race, education level, income, alcohol use, health history, physical activity, and smoking status. Health-related data will include anthropometric and adipometric data, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP in mm Hg), fasting glucose, insulin, weight, height, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). We will use diet, metabolomic profiles from serum samples, genetic data, and imaging data from large population studies. Linear/logistic regression models will be built to assess the gene-environment interactions.
According to Genet Epidemiol: 201-210, to detect an interaction effect size of 2.0 with 80% power, ~2500 samples (N1=N2=2500) are needed. When the interaction effect size is increased to 3.0, ~1800 samples are needed. However, larger sample sizes will allow higher power, which are desirable.","Anticipated Findings
Cardiovascular diseases are associated with disparities in morbidity and mortality rates. Precise screening tools for early detection of at-risk individuals is a priority in public health to address health disparities among individuals from diverse genetic ancestry populations. Considering that cardiovascular diseases have genetic components and associated clinical symptoms, the proposed study aims to elucidate gene-environment interactions contributing to dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases through genetic association analyses. The ultimate goal is to evaluate the possibility of developing predictive models to identify and characterize affected and at-risk individuals from diverse population ancestry.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Can mutations in PTC impact food preferences and lead to hypertensive disorders/hypertension? PTC, also known as phenylthiocarbamide, is a tasting phenotype that has been known to vary amongst human populations. PTC is associated with the ability to taste bitter substances, which has been a genetic, epidemiological, and evolutionary interest to many (Wooding et al., 2004). Since this phenotype varies from person to person, the presence in PTC reflects dietary preference. Per Wooding, PTC perception is capable of revealing the correlation to diet-related disease susceptibility in modern populations (2004). In which case, mutations in the PTC may contribute to the dietary risk factors of hypertension. Thus, the choices individuals with the SNPs that allow for tasting bitterness make about their diet have long term and cumulative effects on their health, specifically forms of cardiovascular disease like hypertension.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Criteria for the patient cohort includes those who have been diagnosed with hypertension. Possible inclusions are individuals with obesity over a reasonable number of pounds pertaining to average weight for a corresponding age range. Trends must be selected for the patient age range as cardiovascular decline is expected in older patients. In addition, a search criteria will be refined to individuals with ""tasting and non-tasting'' PTC mutations. Specifically regions on the TAS2R gene on chromosome 7q that codes for bitter taste receptors (Kim et. al, 2003). Search criteria may be refined to identify single polymorphism nucleotides (SNP) as well as mutations in base pairs that code for tasting and non-tasting respectively. Further research will be conducted to isolate specific base pairs. Several sets of data are necessary to plot statistical analysis of each patient.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that those with mutations in the PTC gene receptor that cause sensitivity to bitter taste, specifically tasters, will be at higher risk for develop hypertensive disorders due to their dietary preferences. Our findings will contribute to the body of scientific knowledge in the field by providing insight into reducing the risk of cardiovascular-related diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Social, Structural, and Environmental Determinants of Health (SSEDOH) influence cardiovascular health in the general population; however, the degree to which this occurs among historically underrepresented individuals is not well described. The purpose of this study is to compare cardiometabolic health (cardiometabolic disease and risks) among the All of Us Program cohort by intersectional identity. We will also compare group-level associations among social, structural, and/or built environmental characteristics and cardiometabolic health and risks.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Diseases (e.g. Diabetes, Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia))
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
A quantitative descriptive approach will be used to characterize ZIP3-level area deprivation and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors among the individuals in the study. Bivariate correlations, multivariable linear, and logistic regression models will be used to examine the relationships among area deprivation indices and cardiometabolic risk factors. We will also include physical activity with the covariates age, sex assigned at birth, sexuality, gender identity, and race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, health insurance status.  We will use logistic regression to determine the odds of hypertension, overweight and obesity , dyslipidemia, poor glycemia control, and also a CMD risk burden score. To assess exposure in the logistic regression model, overall ZIP3-level area deprivation will be dichotomized into two groups. Statistical significance will be set at p <.05. ZIP3-level area deprivation includes both the single factor and Berg 3-Factor area deprivation indices.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate there will be cardiometabolic health disparities (higher disease and higher risk) among sexual minority and gender diverse individuals, individuals from lower socioeconomic positions, historically marginalized populations (e.g. race, ethnicity, uninsured). Those living in areas with greater area deprivation measures will have higher odds of cardiometabolic disease and more risk factors.
Deprivation characteristics may serve to inform novel approaches to improve cardiometabolic health in diverse individuals. The high proportion of an increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiometabolic sequela make these types of social/environmental factors important targets for potentially reducing the disparities. Key stakeholders and policymakers should consider the characteristics of the areas in which people live as well as the characteristics of the people who live in those areas when developing policy and system-level interventional programs.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Background: Patients with prostate cancer (PC) face an elevated risk of both developing and dying from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Given the unique characteristics of this population, the American College of Cardiology Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for ASCVD predictions may lack accuracy.
Methods: Males ≥18 years, diagnosed with PC between 2005-2012 at a hybrid academic-community practice (Northeast Ohio, US) were included. Using XGBoost algorithm we developed using a training subset of the cohort (50% train + 25% test), ranked 33 covariates (including demographic, treatment-related and social determinants of health (SDOH) information) for ASCVD prediction using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The top 10 predictors were transformed in a predictive equation using logistic regression models. This equation was tested in the cohort validation subset (25%), and subsequently compared to the PCE risk score.","Project Purpose(s)

Results: We included 1,506 patients without prior ASCVD , with a median age of 67 (interquartile range 60-74) years, 13.8% had advanced stage disease (TNM III-IV), 1.5% had high risk PC (Gleason 8-10), and 20.5% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Of those, 10.4% had a 10-year ASCVD risk. The PCE had an area under the curve (AUC)=0.61 and underestimated ASCVD in 0.9% (mean risk=20.1% [95% CI 17.2-23.0] vs. mean predicted risk=19.2% [95% CI 18.6-19.8]).  The equation pooled from the top-10 predictors of the ML algorithm (C-index=0.78 [95% CI 0.75-0.81]) achieved an AUC=0.71.
Conclusions: Conventional ASCVD risk scores tend to underestimate the risk in males with PC. A cancer-specific model inclusive of SDOH exhibited good performance and generated a user-friendly equation for predicting ASCVD risk in this population.

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women over the age of 65 in the United States, men account for more than half of the deaths due to CVD. Moreover, evidence suggests that cardiovascular disparities exist among men, such that those who identify as sexual minorities are more likely to experience poor cardiovascular health as compared to heterosexuals. The objective of this proposal is to examine physiological and behavioral mechanisms linking self-reported PTSD to cardiovascular disease risk.

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is characterized by misfolding of the tetrameric transthyretin protein complex that accumulates as extracellular amyloid fibrils and results in polyneuropathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias. We have previously demonstrated that carriers of a genetic variation in the TTR gene (rs76992529; Val122Ile), which is seen more commonly among individuals of African ancestry, have a higher risk of incident heart failure and mortality (heart failure mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality). However, not all carriers of this genetic variant develop heart failure. We seek to pursue the clinical characterization of TTR V122I carriers among the participants of the All Of US to ascertain their clinical characteristics and the impact of environmental factors on the risk of heart failure or mortality.","Project Purpose(s)

The cumulative incidence and multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis with incident CHF & Mortality and adjusted for age, sex, 10 PCs, and study cohort will be analyzed.
3. Impact of Healthy Lifestyle on Risk of Heart Failure and Mortality
we will assess the cumulative incidence of heart failure and death among TTR V122I carriers stratified by a healthy diet and physical activity categories.

We will use multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis with incident CHF & Mortality and are adjusted with age,sex,PC1-10.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings include describing the prevalence of the TTR variant in the overall population and by race and ethnicity and assessing the association of cardiovascular outcomes with the presence of this variant. The results from this analysis may provide a genetic basis to understanding the disparity in cardiovascular disease by allowing identification of individuals at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Thus, the current study open avenues to reduce racial disparities in cardiovascular disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research focus is to investigate the phenotypic traits and health outcomes that associate with sleep deprivation. This is related to recognizing the health impacts and conditions that could be caused by sleep deprivation. We aim to determine whether or not health differences relate to inadequate sleep patterns.
We can also explore what genetic factors can be related to sleep deprivation-related health consequences. By researching the genetics of individuals, we can further understand what different responses they might have when it comes to sleep deprivation.
Most importantly, we want to work out the possible long-term health effects of sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep could possibly contribute to a variety of chronic disease examples like cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, or neurodegenerative conditions. Our research aims to clarify these critical health concerns linked to inadequate sleep.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Sleep deprivation)","Scientific Approaches
As a method for assessing the health effect of sleep deprivation on observed phenotypes, we perform a Phenome-Wide association study (PheWAS). PheWAS requires a group of association tests exhibiting an indexed summary of the human phenome. In our analysis, we will utilize PheWAS for EHR derived sleep deprivation included in the All of Us research dataset. We will be representing sleep deprivation in three formats: SNOMED code, ICD10CM code, and ICD9CM code. To perform PheWas, we will map ICD representations of disease to a common vocabulary of PheCodes. We then use Jupyter notebooks to create reusable functions to perform PheWAS and generate Manhattan Plots to summarize associations.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate that we will be able to replicate known disease associations with sleep deprivation. This will have a significant impact on demonstrating the quality, utility, and diversity of the All of Us data and tools as well as the power of gathering multiple data sources for a single phenotype, providing researchers options for study design and validation. Essentially, the entire PheWAS package is made available for reuse by researchers in the Workbench, ensuring the generation of newly discovered hypotheses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by lifelong elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and dramatically increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genetic studies now suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) encompasses five discrete subtypes based on LDL-c levels, 1) a monogenic FH variant, 2) a high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) polygenic score, 3) elevated lipoprotein(a), 4) elevated LDL-c polygenic score with elevated lipoprotein(a), and 5) a positive family history without an identifiable genetic cause, or true “phenotypic FH.” The primary question of this project is: Are there differences in treatment, comorbidities, and ASCVD outcomes between FH subtypes?","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to screen all individuals with whole genome sequences available for monogenic variants in an FH gene. We will calculate an LDL cholesterol polygenic risk score from each participant’s whole genome sequence. Using labs and measurements, we will identify individuals with an FH subtype.

We will primarily use regression analyses to compare ASCVD risk in those with each FH subtype to individuals without FH.","Anticipated Findings
We expect ASCVD risk to vary among FH subtypes and to be more pronounced in each of the subtypes, relative to those without FH. We also anticipate ASCVD risk and comorbidities to vary between individuals using lipid-lowering medication and those not using medication.

We have evidence to suggest that there is an association between inflammation and cardiovascular disease health. However, less is known about how social determinate of health, such as features of the built environment (e.g. neighborhood safety, urban vs. rural, etc.) are associated with cardiovascular health through inflammation. Moreover, it is unclear how these mechanistic pathways from social determinates of health, through inflammation, to cardiovascular disease risk vary by key sociodemographic features like race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. Thus, the following investigation 2 has research questions.
1. Are environmental features (e.g. housing instability, neighborhood features, etc.) associated with physiological deregulation as measured by inflammation (e.g. cytokines, Interleukin’s, and c-reactive protein, biological markers of inflammation) and thus cardiovascular disease risk?
2. Do these associations vary by race and/or sexual orientation?","Project Purpose(s)

For these analyses we will use the lab and survey data. We will specifically combine the data from 2017-2019 into one cross sectional dataset. Next, we will select the relevant variables and conduct descriptive statistics. For our formal analyses we will run structural equation models as well as a latent class analyses to better specify profiles of inflammation using cytokines, Interleukin’s, and c-reactive protein, and other biological markers of inflammation.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to;
a define meaningful profiles of inflammation;
b understand how social determinates of health are associated with cardiovascular disease through inflammation processes; and
c. understand how this process may vary by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and the intersection of them both.
We believe this is an important contribution to the field given the lack of mechanistic inquiries related to social determinates of health and cardiovascular disease risk particularly for sexual and racial minorities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Does higher visit-to-visit blood pressure predict risk of future cardiovascular diseases?
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and  mortality for the developed countries.
Elevated blood pressure is one of the well-established CVD risk factors.
Few population studies showed statistical associations between blood pressure variation and risk of future CVD.
However, the potential association has not been supported for all studies.
Accordingly, we propose to characterize distributions of blood pressure variations and potential association with CVD risks using the all of us resources.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular diseases)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
To characterize visit to visit variation of blood pressure, at least three blood pressure (BP) measurements at different time periods are required.
Therefore, we plan to acquire electric medical record files and capture participants with at least two  BP measurements those who also have physical measurement at study baseline.    We will identify BP-related information through the electric medical records and medication record files.
We will applied available R code for proportional hazard models.   The analysis models will treat CVD diagnosis of death as the outcome variable while BP variability will be the independent variable.   The regression models will include covariates: age,sex, total and HDL-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, BMI, cigarette smoking, as well as mean BP, and BP slope across all BP  time periods.
In the multi-variable regression model for mortality events, we adjusted CVD risk factors and diagnosis of CVD.","Anticipated Findings

Prevalence estimates with corresponding 95% CIs of the prevalence of CVD conditions, and demographic and clinical factors across AoU subcohorts will be calculated and compared with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression models will be estimated to identify factors associated with completing the personal medical history file among patients with IHD or stroke separately.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the prevalence of stroke and IHD will be lower among participants who responded to the personal medical history questionnairewith EHR release than among participants who responded to the basic survey with EHR release alone.

The aim of this study is to conduct a large-scale phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to explore the relationships between genetic variants in genes related to mitochondrial fission and fusion and a wide range of human disease phenotypes.
Mitochondria are important cellular structures that undergo processes like fission, fusion, and movement. Dysfunctions in these processes have been associated with various diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and aging. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies in large populations that investigate the associations between genetic variants in mitochondrial fission and fusion genes and different disease outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing combinations of genetic variants in these genes to better understand disease associations and gain insights into underlying mechanisms.","Project Purpose(s)

To study the effects of functional rare coding variants in mitochondrial fission and fusion genes, we will use a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) approach. PheWAS involves association tests over the human phenome using HER-derived medical conditions from All of Us research dataset. Additionally, we will adopt a pathway-centric approach that leverages biological pathway information to analyze these genes collectively, as traditional rare variant analysis may be underpowered. We will map ICD representations of diseases to PheCodes and use Jupyter Notebook to create reusable functions for PheWAS and generate Manhattan Plots summarizing associations. This research aims to identify genetic causes of diseases and advance our understanding of mitochondrial dynamic in human health.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate that we will be able to validate some known disease associations with dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion pathways. It is important to note that the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and diseases is multifaceted. While there is evidence implicating dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion in various diseases, the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets are not fully understood.

Menopause transition (MT) is a hormonal imbalance in women starting at the age of 40 that elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. The decline in estrogen during menopause increases the risk of CVD. In racial and ethnic minority groups, this risk is higher, particularly among Blacks (58.5%), Hispanics (42.7%), and Asians (42.5%). (American Heart Association, 2021). The study analyzes the demographic data of CVD-related medical conditions and their relationship with MT, which highlights the importance of addressing CVD health during menopause.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
The study examines sex, age, race, and cardiovascular disease-related conditions (hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) in a sample of 372,380 participants from the National Institute of Health (NIH) All of Us Data Browser and Workbench. The data was analyzed to raise awareness of CVD risk in women. The All of Us Research Data Browser was used to obtain information regarding age and sex, whereas the data collected from the All of Us Workbench was regarding race and ethnicity. The racial and ethnic categories include Asian, Black, White, Hispanics and Latinos, and Other (which contain the subcategories ""I prefer not to answer,"" ""None Indicated,"" ""None of these,"" and ""Skip”). This study analyzed data using descriptive and explanatory statistics using Microsoft Excel frequency measures.","Anticipated Findings
Women tend to have a higher incidence rate of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia compared to men which suggests an increased risk of developing CVD.
The All of Us Research Data Browser highlights the disparity in CVD incidence rates between different racial and ethnic groups. The All of Us data helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between age, gender, and race in the prevalence of CVD-related conditions.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects women, or people with ovaries, worldwide. Because non-female identifying people with ovaries are a population of interest in this study, the proposed study will not exclude those who identify as another gender but were assigned the female sex at birth. People diagnosed with PCOS, typically via sonogram or ultrasound, also present with numerous other health issues. Being diagnosed with PCOS is also linked to reproductive irregularity, insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, and many more. These different aspects of health are issues known for being further affected by minority identities such as non-white Race and sexual/gender minorities. Not having enough power, or a large sample size, may be adversely affecting the associations among people with PCOS and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although, there seems to be inconsistency among studies finding statistically significant relationships between CVD risk and PCOS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The overall study design will consist of a cross-sectional case control where age, sex, and race will be matched between cases and controls.  The main outcome variable is CVD risk, which will be measured as a score of 3 levels: ideal, average, and poor. This score is taken from the American Heart Association’s guidelines on assessing and preventing cardiovascular disease. This is known as the Life’s Simple 7 score and is compiled through covariates of heart disease like smoking status, BMI, exercise, cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose, and diet. In addition to those covariates, demographic information, which is also collected by All of Us, will be included in the analysis. There will be an attempt to keep many diverse racial and gender/sexual minorities (assuming sample sizes are adequate). Statistical analysis plans will consist of logistic regression on a three-level factored outcome variable (Simple 7 score).","Anticipated Findings
The researcher anticipates interpretable findings from this study. Because the research question is presented as an investigation of a relationship, there is no anticipation of whether the CVD risk among PCOS populations will sway one way or the other. Previous literature and research has shown that there may be an increased risk of CVD among these populations, which may be exacerbated by the presence of other determinants of health like race, assigned sex at birth, and many more. Overall, the purpose of the study is to add validated and sound research to the body of literature with All of Us data, specifically.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question
What is the incidence of heart failure or adverse cardiac events in Black/ African American women who are long-term (5 years or more) survivors of breast cancer?

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare multi-system disease which arises from a chromosomal microdeletion of 7q11.23, comprising 25 to 27 genes, including the elastin gene. The defects in the elastin gene, leading to elastin haploinsufficiency, underlie the arteriopathy in WBS, although alternate genes are known to modulate cardiovascular phenotypes. Cardiovascular problems are the main cause of morbidity and mortality and occur in 80-85% of all WS patients. Great vessel diseases are the most common cardiovascular abnormalities in WBS, however any artery can potentially be involved due to elastin haploinsufficiency.  Sudden cardiac death is also a prominent feature that is the leading cause of death among WBS patients. Recent studies pointed out the autonomic and heart rate dysregulations in WBS. Based on this, we would like to investigate the heart rate and sleep patterns among WBS patients.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the genetics and associated information in the All of Us research dataset to analyze genetic contributions to bipolar disorder, its comorbidities and treatment response, in racial and ethnic minority populations. Specific questions we will ask are:
1. Are the genetic associations for bipolar disorder previously identified in white populations also associated with Black and Latino populations?
2. Are genetic associations between biopolar disorder and cardiovascular disease (or metabolic syndrome) observed in white, Black, and Latino populations?
3. Are there unique genetic polymorphisms in Black populations associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder treatment?
We hypothesize that genetic associations with bipolar disorder in racial and ethnic minority populations will partially overlap with genetic variation previously identified in white populations, but that there will be unique population-specific variation as well, particularly for lithium response.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Bipolar Disorder)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use PLINK and/or other GWAS tools within the All of Us Research Workbench on whole genome sequence data. The population with bipolar disorder or manic episodes without a bipolar disorder diagnosis will be defined by ICD-10-CM codes of F31.x and/or F30.x respectively. Racial and gender self-identification will be used as primary covariates with other demographic variables (e.g., age) considered as confounding variables. Ancestry informative markers and whole genome PCA will be used to control for genetic ancestry and population substructure. We will also consider BMI and other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol diabetes). Lastly we will examine therapeutic doses of lithium and lithium response (where possible). Limitations include lack of specificity in diagnosis and/or presentation and incomplete or unclear data on efficacy of specific pharmaceutical therapy.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate confirming that genetic variation associated with bipolar disorder in white populations is similar, though not necessarily identical, in racial and ethnic minority populations. We also anticipate identifying genetic factors unique to these populations, particularly associated with lithium response. Trans-ethnic studies are important, even as validation studies, because they extend our understanding of disease to populations that have been traditionally underserved in medicine. Further, these studies will elucidate differences in response to lithium that have hindered proper access to treatment.
Because the intersection of mental health, genetics, and racial disparities can be stigmatizing, we surveyed the patient community and developed a community advisory board (CAB) of stakeholders (including patients) focused on bipolar disorder and genomics for regular feedback. This is in addition to more general CABs and collaborative efforts towards mental health literacy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

I have developed a method called SLAC-Time, which utilizes a self-supervised learning approach for clustering multivariate time series data with missing values. I intend to apply SLAC-Time to group patients with cardiovascular diseases using the data from the All of Us dataset. This is fitting, as these patients are represented through clinical multivariate time-series data. Therefore, this context presents a suitable scenario for evaluating the effectiveness of SLAC-Time. In this research, I will investigate if SLAC-Time provides clinically meaningful clusters of cardiovascular patients and if there is a significant difference between the clusters. We are going to identify the feature profile of the cardiovascular patient phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular diseases)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
The scientific approaches I plan to employ in this study mainly revolve around the utilization of SLAC-Time, a self-supervised learning-based method I have developed. This approach is tailored for clustering multivariate time series data, even in instances where certain values may be missing.
The primary dataset I intend to work with is the All of Us dataset, which contains a wealth of health data from diverse individuals. This dataset is particularly useful for my study, as it includes a rich set of clinical multivariate time-series data that represents patients with cardiovascular diseases.
Lastly, the tools I will use for this study are likely to be a combination of machine learning frameworks, statistical analysis software, and data visualization tools. They will be used to implement SLAC-Time, analyze the results, and visually represent the clusters of cardiovascular patients and their defining features.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study will hopefully reveal that SLAC-Time can effectively cluster cardiovascular patients in a manner that produces clinically meaningful clusters. Additionally, we expect to find a significant difference between these clusters, which will give us insights into the various phenotypes of cardiovascular patients.
These findings will contribute to the body of scientific knowledge by providing a new perspective on patient grouping based on time-series data. Moreover, the application of SLAC-Time on cardiovascular disease data could help in personalized treatment approaches, understanding disease progression patterns, and potentially uncovering new subtypes of cardiovascular diseases. The ability to handle missing data will also provide a more robust tool for real-world clinical data, which often contains gaps. This can potentially lead to more accurate disease prediction and patient management strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is a key enzyme in the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and is associated with ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Knockout rats for SphK1 gene exhibited heightened susceptibility of the myocardium to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, which impaired protective effects of IPC (PMID: 17610857). S1P exerts its protective function by binding to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). A specific genetic variant of S1PR1 (rs41287280, c.37C>T, p.R13G) has previously been identified as a potential protective factor against coronary artery disease (PMID: 25293589). However, the impact of this genetic variant on cardiovascular outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI) patients remains uncertain. Hence, this study aims to investigate the independent association between the rs41287280 genetic variant and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in patients with MI.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective community-based cohort study will be conducted enrolling all genotyped patients who had myocardial infarction (MI). All demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will be collected. Patients will be stratified into two subgroups according the harboring of the genetic variant. A propensity score matching method will be used to match patients by their clinical variables at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression will be applied to assess the independent association between the rs41287280 genetic variant and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (primary: 3-point MACE; secondary: CV death, non-fatal MI, hospitalization for heart failure). Bonferroni's p-value correction method will be applied to prevent false-positive associations.","Anticipated Findings
If our findings corroborate previous evidence, individuals with the rs41287280 genetic variant are expected to experience significantly fewer cardiovascular events compared to those without the variant. This is the first study to date to reveal the influence of this genetic variant on cardiovascular outcomes in individuals who have experienced myocardial infarction (MI). The research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge regarding the impact of genetics on the individual variability of cardiovascular outcomes in those with similar clinical characteristics. Furthermore, it may unravel the significance of protective metabolic pathways, such as SphK1-SP1, in activating ischemic preconditioning, which holds immense therapeutic potential.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Primary headache disorders, including migraine, are debilitating neurological conditions, managed with acute and preventive treatment, with and without medications.  Aerobic walking has several health benefits, it is included as one of non-pharmachological treatment strategies. Counting steps during walking is a method of evaluating daily activity, and may help individuals achieve physical activity goals. A higher number of steps per day has been associated with reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, GERD,  but limited information is available for migraine and other headache disorders.

Disease Focused Research (Headache Disorders, Migraine)","Scientific Approaches
All participants with FitBit data will be included in this study. Our data set will include demographic information, history of medical conditions (cardiovascular, obesity, depression), headache disorders diagnosed by eletronic health records and by self-report diagnosis at the patient provided information medical history questionnaire,  mean blood pressure, height, weight, mean waist circumference, mean hip circumference, mean heart rate, and daily summary activity Fitbit data. Mean number of steps per day will be illustrated with descriptive statistics. We will analyze differences in mean steps per day for our subgroups of interest  with t-tests, and plot daily step counts with incident risk of headache disorders.","Anticipated Findings
The goal of this project is to describe physical activity in individuals diagnosed with headache disorders by quantifying the amount of steps taken per day. We also aim to understand if steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex in headache patients versus matched controls without pain conditions and any other disease. Based on prior literature, we predict a mean number of steps per day of approximately 5,000. Migraine individuals may have lower mean steps compare to controls.  Additionally, we predict mean steps per day will be higher in male and white participants.
Further, we expect the relationship between steps per day and migraine is inverse and linear.

Mosaicism of chromosomes is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. While this age-related phenomenon has been known for many years, awareness of the potential role of mosaicism in human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancers, and cardiovascular disease, is a more recent development. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mosaicism in hematopoietic cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Based on prior studies, cardiac (atrial) inflammation, and fibrosis can result in disruption of normal atrial conduction and is a powerful predictor of risk for the development and progression of atrial fibrillation. In the current study, we aim to better understand the association of mosaicism with the development and progression of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to characterize a spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 genetic variants. More than a decade after the discovery of the trypanolytic missense variants in APOL1, it is now known that APOL1 high-risk variants are relatively common in individuals with sub-Saharan ancestry and are associated with higher risk of progressive chronic kidney disease. Although associations with cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, and preeclampsia have been reported, these associations warrant replication. Considering the expression of APOL1 in a wide range of cell types and that it is found as both a circulating and intracellular protein, it is likely that other diseases may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants and that these associations may be missed due to study design and statistical power. We plan to conduct a phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) using All of Us datasets to shed light to possible undetected diseases and phenotypes that may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Since APOL1 is exclusively found in individuals with sub-Saharan African ancestry, we plan to create a cohort of individuals who self-identify as Black (including Hispanic, African, African American, and Caribbean individuals and assess corresponding genomics data (for APOL1 genotyping), electronic health record (EHR) data of AoU datasets including diagnosis (ICD) and baseline demographics and measurements (BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, clinical chemistry data, and hormone levels). We will classify individuals into three groups based on the number of risk alleles carried: 0 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G0 genotype), 1 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G1, G0/G2), and 2 APOL1 risk alleles (G1/G1, G1/G2, G2/G2). Then, we will conduct a phenome-wide association study, to define the spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 high-risk variants using PheWAS R package.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases, creatinine and albuminuria measurements will show association with APOL1 high-risk genotypes that are consistent with previous reports, but given the size of the All-of-Us cohort, should narrow the confidence interval giving a more precise odds-ratio and a relative risk. Similarly, we can confirm (or not) the previously reported associations of sepsis, preeclampsia, and cardiovascular diseases with APOL1 high-risk genotypes, which would bring additional evidence that the association between these conditions and APOL1 high-risk genotypes. If novel phenotypes are found to be associated with APOL1 high-risk variant this will open new areas for investigation of APOL1-associated phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Individuals with chronic kidney disease are particularly at risk of cardiovascular disease, with risk increasing as kidney function declines. Given kidney function changes over the course of an individual’s life, predicting events in this population may be more difficult.
We would like to assess how existing polygenic risk scores perform in the kidney disease population and if this can help target treatments to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (kidney disease)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use existing polygenic risk scores and assess their performance in the chronic kidney disease population. It is well established that existing genetic risk scores perform poorly in populations with different ancestry from which they were developed. Given measurable disparities in kidney disease and associated cardiovascular disease, we hope to assess performance stratified by genetic ancestry.
Prior to using genetic data, we are going to study the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in AllofUs stratified by self-reported ethnicity and assess whether there are enough cardiovascular events to perform the analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that polygenic risk scores generated in a predominantly European ancestry populations will perform poorly in individuals with kidney impairment, particularly when applied to individuals with different and diverse ancestry.
Although impairments of kidney function are common, repeated measures of kidney function are often lacking in the general population. We can use this to understand to what extent the change in kidney function over time is contributing to differences in performance. This latter aspect has not been addressed in prior work.
This work will provide valuable insights into utility of genetic scores for cardiovascular disease in the kidney disease population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease risk is known to be influenced by both the severity of a risk factor and the duration of exposure. However, this concept has been largely neglected within the obesity literature. While obesity severity has been closely linked with cardiometabolic diseases, the risk of developing these conditions among those with obesity may be augmented by greater obesity duration over the lifespan. Few longitudinal or contemporary studies have investigated the influence of both factors in combination – cumulative obesity exposure – instead generally focusing on obesity severity, often at a single time point, given ease of use and lack of established methods to encapsulate duration. We aim to assess the influence of obesity duration on the incidence of a variety of CVD diagnoses within AllofUs.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to identify individuals with obesity and calculate their duration of time with obesity. and will assess HR for incident CVD with this variable.","Anticipated Findings

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in Americans, but certain minority groups are more affected, one being African Americans. Heart disease is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle. African Americans with heart disease were also impacted by Covid-19. Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During the Covid-19 pandemic, African Americans who had heart disease developed a condition called myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the middle layer of the heart. It can cause a weakened heart, heart failure, abnormal heartbeat, and sudden death. There seemed to be a link between myocarditis patients and people who tested positive for Covid-19. This research showed that cardiovascular disease was found in African Americans more after they had been impacted by Covid-19, which led to myocarditis because of their dietary habits, physical inactivity, and stress.","Project Purpose(s)

Our training data will be the group of people who have already been diagnosed with a form of heart disease, and at what age they were given this diagnosis.

We will also explore various other inputs included within the All of Us dataset to investigate whether there are additional inputs which may be a significant indicator of developing heart disease. Modern machine learning methods such as supervised classification algorithms and supervised regression algorithms will be implemented using Python.

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions.

Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.

Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Second, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions.

To complete my MPH degree, I plan to use this dataset for my capstone project. I plan to research the association between perceived neighborhood safety and cardiovascular disease among AoU participants. I plan to see if renting or owning a home has any additional effect and after, if having a condition of a mental health diagnosis. I plan to do a cross-sectional analysis with the dataset.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (heart disease)","Scientific Approaches
The dependent variable was incidence of the condition cardiovascular disease, which would include at least one of the following diagnoses – heart disease, congenital heart disease, coronary arteriosclerosis. The condition was evaluated as a nominal variable. The main independent variable was perceived neighborhood safety which was derived from the survey prompt, “My neighborhood is safe.” There were 4 Likert scale responses: agree, strongly agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. I will consider the covariates of housing ownership and mental health and use logistic regressions to run analyses between these variables and covariates.","Anticipated Findings
I hypothesize that a lower perception of neighborhood safety will be a significant factor of cardiovascular disease among participants. This would be very helpful when considering social determinants of health and could assist with policy design and community interventions. Previous studies have looked at perceived neighborhood safety and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and have found significant results.

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between dental infections (as consequence of dental caries and pulp necrosis) and additional diseases (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) although limitations of such studies hamper conclusive interpretations . We showed that apical periodontitis (pulp necrosis with bone resorption) was strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease; further, we identified an association between an established hypertension-associated gene with apical periodontitis in a well-characterized population. These findings strongly indicate that a shared genetic etiology could contribute to oral health-systemic health relationships. By using All of Us data, we hope to validate our previous findings and expand knowledge of the etiology linking oral health and systemic health. We will identify additional factors (social determinants of health) that may play a role in the interconnectedness between oral health and general health.","Project Purpose(s)

Data available via All of Us research workbench shows 20 dental infection conditions that reflect a continuum of dental infection (i.e., dental caries, pulpal and periapical conditions) of interest. We are interested to investigate if relationships exist between these dental infection conditions with type 2 diabetes, hypertensive disorder, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart murmur and cerebrovascular accident.
We will access demographic, clinical (dental and medical) and genetic data from individuals with the above conditions (no exclusions based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or genetic ancestry). We will test for association between a set of conditions, and will also identify potential genes/variants associated with a combined phenotype of dental infection + systemic condition using a variety of tools and statistical methods. All of Us data will allow us to identify a large sample of unrelated controls to increase confidence in the results.","Anticipated Findings
Much of the controversial findings in epidemiological and genetic association studies looking at oral/dental and systemic conditions is due to differences in populations studied, data ascertainment methodologies, but mainly due to limited sample sizes. This study will leverage high-quality demographic/clinical and genomic data of a large and diverse dataset that will allow the best (largest) evidence to date.

Individuals with complex diseases can have different mutations within a single gene or set of interacting genes, which predispose them to the same disease. To address this issue, we are developing a new statistical method that produces ""epistatic scores"" — summarizing how strongly genes and pathways interact and drive the broad-sense heritability of a phenotype or trait of interest. Our research will test several control condition phenotypes for traits that are supposed to be more heritable and less susceptible to environmental influences, to include less complex and more visible phenotypes such as height, as well as health-based phenotypes such as cardiovascular risk. Recent studies designed to estimate the effects of interactions on complex phenotypes have demonstrated that genetic and environmental factors both contribute significant marginal effects; however, the interaction between them has been consistently deemed non-significant to the broad-sense heritability of these traits.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The main statistical framework we will use is the ""MArginal ePIstasis Test"" or MAPIT (Crawford et al. 2017, PLoS Genet), a linear mixed modeling strategy for detecting genetic variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) involved in statistical epistasis in genetic mapping studies. In the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MAPIT estimates and tests the marginal epistatic effect or the combined epistatic effect between SNPs of interest and all other SNPs in the data. We propose to apply our method to multiple traits assayed in the AllofUs dataset, including Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Type 2 Diabetes, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Standing Height, and Body-Mass Index. Our research will yield new insight into the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying these traits.","Anticipated Findings
We aim to interrogate whether interactive effects between genes and different environments contribute to explanations of complex behavioral traits. For example, we can interrogate the interaction between genes that may contribute to the risk of depression and environmental modifiers. By extending the MAPIT framework, we will characterize the risk and measure how environmental and structural features (e.g., socioeconomic status, neighborhood, etc.) serve as statistical covariates. With regard to public health relevance, these novel sets of associations and actionable variables can influence how illnesses are diagnosed and treated. Statistics historically underrepresented the impact of environmental conditions on genetic outcomes; therefore, we aim to provide a more appropriate statistical test for interrogating gene-by-environment effects within and between populations regarding their impact on complex behavioral phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In order to understand the relationship of platelets and how abnormal counts can affect or lead to patients with diseases and disorders, we will be looking for relationships in various problems including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
Questions to be researched are as follows:
1. How do patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease compare to those without in the general population in relationship to platelet count?
2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures. The results will demonstrate whether COVID-19 infection increased economic, job, and health access disparities among Hispanic participants.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will define a cohort on All of Us that includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants who self-report COVID-19 infection, have record of a positive PCR test for COVID-19, or have COVID-19 antigens. We will produce data visualization of key results and build logistic regression models predicting ethnicity build using the selected variables of COVID-19 infection and related social determinants of health.  Appropriate interactions will be included to produce a model with explanatory power and parsimonious fit.","Anticipated Findings
1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one the leading causes of death in the world and rates can differ by ethnicity and race due to both genetics and environment. Cardiometabolic phenotypes such as lipid levels, blood pressure, BMI, and blood glucose levels are established CVD risk factors and are used clinically to define pre- and overt disease. Understanding the genetic architecture of these phenotypes within and between ethnic groups will provide a better understanding how genetic differences might shape differential CVD disease risk and prevalence.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Investigate the genetic architecture of cardiometabolic phenotypes contributing to CVD risk within and between ethnicities.
  
)","Scientific Approaches
We will use mixed model methods to estimate genetic heritability and genetic correlations of the cardiometabolic phenotypes and to perform genome-wide association. The models will include a genetic relationship matrix constructed using the chip data. Covariate adjustments will include age, sex, demographics, principal components, and others as identified as correlated with the phenotype. The model will include heterogenous error variances by ethnicity to account for differences in phenotype distributions.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the genetic architecture of cardiometabolic traits such as lipids, BMI, and blood pressure within and between ethnicities as measured by heritability, genetic correlation and genetic association will differ. The differences may provide a broader understanding of how these traits together with other non-genetic factors might contribute to differences in CVD disease risk and prevalence.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for nearly 30% of postpartum maternal deaths (PMDs) and 81% of CVD-related deaths occurred in postpartum. CVD-related PMDs are often associated with missed or delayed diagnoses, and most could be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. However, existing CVD risk assessment models such as Modified WHO classification, CARPREG II, and California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) algorithm are lack of sufficient ability to accurately predict postpartum CVD since (i) most postpartum CVD cases had no prior diagnosis of CVD, (ii) many symptoms of CVD overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms, and (iii) only a few risk factors were included in the models. Most importantly, no existing model has accounted for the complicated temporal dynamics during the pregnancy, which could serve as invaluable evidence for predicting the postpartum disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular system disease, long COVID, maternal health, etc.)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will (1) characterize the risk factors accounting for temporal variants for postpartum CVD using unsupervised ML techniques. Our working hypothesis is that account for temporal relationship will provide a novel and more comprehensive group of risk factors for postpartum CVD; (2) Develop predictive models for postpartum CVD using supervised ML algorithms and regressions. Our working hypothesis is that the novel ML models accounting for temporal dynamics will achieve better performance compared to the existing models; and (3) Assess the potential to reduce healthcare costs by the prevention and early diagnosis of CVD. Out working hypothesis is that the failure to predict postpartum CVD generates excessive and unnecessary health care cost.","Anticipated Findings
As the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified a comprehensive group of timely risk factor for postpartum CVD and developed a group of ML models that are able to forecast the onset of postpartum CVD. We also expect to have evaluated the potential healthcare savings brought by these predictive models. These results are expected to have and important positive impact because they will provide a strong and data-driven knowledge framework for further development and future clinical decision supporting system, ultimately providing new opportunities for the development of novel therapies to prevent and treat postpartum CVD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will conduct a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of family history of common chronic diseases in diverse All of Us participants. We will also investigate the risk of various chronic diseases based on reporting a  family history of the same disease or other diseases. We will investigate factors associated with increased familial risks such as age of onset of disease, number of affected relatives and other covariates. Family history is considered one of the most important risk factors for health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and other chronic conditions. Even though many researchers have studied risk of family history of few chronic conditions, the family history module of All of Us research data set contains 104 different conditions that can be analyzed to assess familial risk in more details.","Project Purpose(s)

Diabetes remains an overwhelming public health burden in the United States with the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes reaching an estimated 8.7% of the adult population in 2019. Among patient with DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Importantly, the burden of disease is not shared equally across the population; racial and socioeconomic disparities are evident in recent DM data.
The goal of this project is to use the All of Us Research Program database to explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in composite CVD risk factor control amongDM patients with and without CVD. We want to know 1. Among patients with diabetes mellitus with and without CVD, what is the extent of composite risk factor control (BP, HbA1c, LDL-C, BMI, tobacco status, activity level? 2. How is race, ethnicity, sex, income, and healthcare access associated with number of risk factors at target for control?","Project Purpose(s)

Demographic data will be compared in patients with and without CVD using a survey t test for continuous variables or Chi-squared test for categorial variables.

Multiple logistic regression will be used to identify if race, sex, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare are associated with individual and composite risk factor control.","Anticipated Findings

2. Why is the maternal mortality rate in the United States rising despite technological advancements?
3. What is creating the cardiovascular health differences between Black and white mothers that have traditionally been attributed to causing the maternal mortality racial disparity?
4. Are there genetic differences between races that causes a high maternal mortality rate in one but not another? What else could cause this difference?
5. What could be other causes of the racial disparity in maternal mortality aside from cardiovascular health differences? Do implicit bias, structural racism, or cultural differences play a role?
6. What can be done to remedy this disparity in maternal health outcomes, both for cardiovascular health differences and for any alternative explanations? Should we target improvements by the patient, the provider, or the entire healthcare system?","Project Purpose(s)

)","Scientific Approaches
The primary scientific approach of this work space is analyzing the data in the All of Us Database regarding maternal mortality, cardiovascular health, cardiovascular risk factors, and social determinants of health. We will be looking at the differences in maternal health outcomes between Black and white populations in the database, as they relate to differences in these cardiovascular and social metrics, along with genetic data. The primary statistical analysis will be T-tests that evaluate the impact of genetic influences on differences in maternal mortality, along with information about how the socioeconomic status of individuals can predispose them to a high mortality rate.","Anticipated Findings
Currently, much of the data collected suggest one reason for the high maternal mortality rate in African American women in the United States; cardiovascular-related complications. We hope to find potential alternative conclusions that suggest other causes for the high maternal mortality rate in African American women. We also anticipate demonstrating the fallacies in the current race-based  view of cardiovascular health differences and elucidate possible social determinants of cardiovascular health that are, in turn, affecting maternal mortality rates. The workspace will analyze all aspects that create a poor healthcare system, the long-term effects of systemic racism, and a cycle of neglect towards this population. The findings from the analysis will contribute in creating awareness of the true factors which contribute to maternal mortality, and how to identify and prevent such factors effectively.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Age related hearing loss, or presbycusis, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, with hypertension as a predictor of faster rates of hearing decline10. Impairments in cochlear microcirculation and perfusion have been identified in patients with presbycusis. RAS targeted treatments have the potential for system-wide vasoprotective effects with the potential to protect microcirculation within the inner ear and thus preserve hearing in such clinical conditions with significant vasculopathic contributions. We propose to query population databases to identify previously unexplored associations of RAS blockade and hearing loss.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Profound sensorineural hearing loss)","Scientific Approaches
This experiment will leverage the considerable power of population databases to identify previously unexplored associations between anti-hypertensive treatment with RAS inhibitors and surrogate measures of hearing decline, including hearing aid use, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, and progression to cochlear implantation. These retrospective epidemiological experiments will test the specific hypothesis that among patients who are treated for hypertension, those who are prescribed ACEis or ARBs will have a lower frequency of diagnostic codes for hearing loss (e.g. ICD 9 code 389.1 and 389.2) and of cochlear implantation (e.g. ICD 9 codes 20.96 to 20.98) than those patients on other antihypertensive treatments (e.g. diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers). We will test this aim via a database review of the All of Us database.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that findings from these studies may greatly aid in the translation of these therapies into the clinical realm.

Persons with bipolar disorder (BD) are at significantly increased risk of excess medical morbidity and early mortality.  To our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive descriptive epidemiologic paper of physical conditions in BD, the way there are descriptive epidemiologic papers of psychiatric comorbidity in BD.  The majority of research has focused on a particular physical system (e.g., cardiovascular), combined mood disorders or exclude BD entirely, or do not address comorbidity and disparities amongst conditions.  Most of the US national surveys with superb psychiatric phenotyping are aging.  Correspondingly, there has been a shift from survey research to secondary analyses of electronic health records, registries, and biobanks.  We will comprehensively describe burden, correlates and disparities, and multimorbidity of physical conditions amongst persons with BD in All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (bipolar disorder)","Scientific Approaches
In an effort to assess the utility and important differences in the shift from representative surveys to large-scale clinical registries, we will be conduct descriptive analyses of physical conditions in persons with BD in All of Us. Such analyses include calculating means and proportions of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and comorbidity assessed by calculating odds ratios between BD and physical conditions, as well as across sociodemographic strata.  We may further enrich our understanding of these associations by estimating population-attributable risk proportions and examining tetrachoric correlations.","Anticipated Findings
Comorbidity may be more common in clinical samples than representative epidemiologic surveys, although occasionally clinical biobanks have more healthy participants than observed in broader clinical datasets.  Additionally, the All of Us is contemporary whereas US nationally representative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys (e.g., the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication) are approximately 2 decades old.  For these reasons, we expect to observe differences in comorbidity between BD and physical conditions when comparing All of Us to prior surveys.  We expect to observe salient disparities that may suggest important follow-up research questions as well as potential opportunities to improve care/service.  This will be a contemporary resource on burden, correlates, and disparities in BD comorbidity that can inform future studies, and lend insight into the potential modernization of psychiatric epidemiology data.","Demographic Categories of Interest

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable cause of premature mortality globally.

Hispanic and Latino individuals are the largest minority population in U.S. and have a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular risk factors and chronic kidney disease. Despite this, the Hispanic and Latino populations have been under-represented among genetic studies, which have been massively conducted in samples with European ancestry. Although socio-economic factors, such as suitable access to health care, may play a role in the differences of the disease risks across diverse populations, a better understanding of the genetic determinants influencing cardiovascular risk factors and the chronic kidney disease risk in Hispanic or Latino individuals will allow for personalized medical treatments, contributing to mitigate the health disparities.

Aerobic walking has known health benefits and is one of the preferred methods of exercise given its low risk profile. Counting steps during walking is a method of evaluating daily activity, and with the rise of wearable technology, has become even easier. Additionally, studies have shown that counting steps may help individuals achieve physical activity goals. Further, a higher number of steps per day has been associated with reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Prior studies evaluating steps per day in the United States rely on data collected more than ten years ago. With the advent of new wearable technology, we aim to explore the more contemporary All of Us Fitbit data to assess the following questions:
1.	What is the average number of steps per day in all participants?
2.	Do average number of steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex?
3.	How do number of steps walked per day differ in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
All participants with FitBit data will be included in this study. Our data set will include demographic information, history of medical conditions and medications, mean blood pressure, height, weight, mean waist circumference, mean hip circumference, mean heart rate, and daily summary activity Fitbit data. Mean number of steps per day will be illustrated with descriptive statistics. We will analyze differences in mean steps per day for our subgroups of interest (age, race, sex, history of cardiovascular disease) with t-tests.","Anticipated Findings
The goal of this project is to describe physical activity in the US population by quantifying the amount of steps taken per day. We also aim to understand if steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Based on prior literature, we predict a mean number of steps per day of approximately 5,000. Additionally, we predict mean steps per day will be higher in male and white participants. Further, we expect those with cardiovascular disease to take less steps per day. Results from this study will help clinicians and public health experts better understand physical activity levels in a more contemporary sample of the United States.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Statins are a cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States. Despite the conclusive evidence to the reduction of mortality among ASCVD patients, adherence patterns to this treatment remain alarmingly low with rates of discontinuity approaching 50% in the US population. Current research investigating this pattern have elucidated the impact of clinic-specific factors and patient-physician interactions, but these studies have been limited in generalizability as a result of operating in isolated health care systems. I seek to implement novel computational techniques to analyze patient record data en masse and to uncover the epidemiology of treatment adherence and to address unmet clinical needs of particularly vulnerable patient populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze electronic health records in the aggregate. This will allow the identification of patterns of treatment adherence for statin medication across the population.","Anticipated Findings
Previous research has suggested that patient adherence is multilayer, affected by factors like differences in clinical systems, patient-physician interaction, and systemic inequality. However, the difficulty of parsing through unstructured clinical notes has reduced many study designs to look at single health care systems and introduce significant bias in the findings. This has limited a robust understanding of the epidemiology of statin use and have likely contributed to unmet clinical needs of patients particularly from high-risk and vulnerable communities. My work will fill gaps in the understanding of statin adherence to inform future policy changes and promote better access to care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose of this research is to establish whether it is feasible to study the pharmacogenomic determinants of antiplatelet therapy response in the AllofUs Program. We would like to estimate the number of participants who have been prescribed various antiplatelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel, ticagrelor, etc.) as well as the subset of individuals who have experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event during therapy. If feasible, ultimately we would like to identify genetic variants that impact the rates of on-treatment cardiovascular events.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We would like to define cohorts based on antiplatelet medication usage and relevant cardiovascular events using the Cohort Builder and Dataset Builder. Specifically, we will query the number of patients who have been prescribed antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, aspirin, etc. Furthermore, we would like to ascertain the number of patients who have experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event while on therapy. Assuming the sample size seems adequate, power analyses may be performed to determine if genetic analyses are warranted. If it is deemed feasible, a robust analytical strategy will be developed to test for association between genetic markers and related clinical phenotypes in patients who have been prescribed antiplatelet therapy.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the AllofUs dataset will contain an adequate number of data points to assess the association between genetic variants and cardiovascular endpoints in those prescribed antiplatelet therapy...at least for those medications that are more commonly prescribed. Assuming the dataset is sufficiently powered, we anticipate that we would be to identify genetic variation that influences antiplatelet therapy response.
Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Antiplatelet therapy is routinely used to reduce the rates of recurrent cardiovascular events in those who have suffered an initial event. Understanding the factors that influence response to treatment not only allows us to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of variable antiplatelet response but may also lead to more personalized strategies to reduce adverse clinical outcomes in those who are prescribed these medications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma.

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions.

We aim to use differential penetrance among ancestries to investigate the role of epistasis and ancestral genomic background on a cardiovascular disease (CVD) pathogenic variant.
More specifically, it was recently discovered in a paper by Murdock et al that the LPA variant rs3798220 known to increase CVD in European ancestry individuals was not strongly associated with CVD for those in the Hispanic community. To investigate this pattern more fully and understand genetic drivers for this difference in CVD, we are investigating whether ancestral haplotypes surrounding rs3798220, or an additional variant enriched in the Hispanic population explains the decreased CVD risk.","Project Purpose(s)

This study will generate findings regarding the impact of local ancestry and epistasis on the variant rs3798220.

Mineral metabolism disturbances are ubiquitous in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with fracture risk, soft tissue and vascular calcification, and cardiovascular-related mortality. GWAS of circulating mineral metabolism markers among individuals of European ancestry have identified common variants associated with circulating PTH, calcium, phosphate and FGF23. The impact of  these variants among persons with CKD, who have the most pronounced disturbances in mineral metabolism, is unknown. Moreover, it is possible that genetic associations may differ according to racial background, given known racial-ethnic differences in PTH and vitamin D metabolism in patients with CKD.  Elucidating these associations specifically within a CKD population is important, not only because of the marked abnormalities in mineral metabolism and racial-ethnic differences, but also because these abnormalities are systematically evaluated and treated in clinical practice among persons with CKD.","Project Purpose(s)

Genetic variation plays an important role in disease-related traits, such as body mass index (BMI), cholesterol levels, and other lab values associated with cardiovascular disease. One important way of identifying disease-relevant biology is by examining rare genetic variants resulting in the complete loss of function of a given gene. This occurs when an individual contains two copies of a damaging variant at the same genetic locus. These variants (called ""knockouts""), though rare, can result in extreme phenotypes that can reveal important disease mechanisms leading to novel treatment approaches. Sometimes, these variants can even result in lab values associated with lower disease risk, which provides an important clue for potential strategies to improve health. This study, building off preliminary data from the UK Biobank, will examine the association of genetic knockouts on disease-related traits.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This study will examine exome data to identify homozygous loss of function (and predicted damaging missense) variants. Carriers of homozygous variants will be compared to non-carriers on a variety of disease-related quantitative traits.

We will be especially sensitive to any population-specific variants, so as not to create stigmatizing effects of research.

It is well known that there is a strong association between Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). Although there are several CVD prediction scores available to predict the probability of CVD in the general population, none of them are accurate enough to estimate the extent of CVD risk in CKD patients. For example, the Framingham score has been questioned as it was created based on a homogenous, geographically restricted and predominantly white population. Additionally, there are other factors (non-traditional risk factors of CVD that are specific to CKD such as albuminuria, anemia, fluid overload etc.) which are not included in the Framingham score which may play an essential role in estimating ischemic heart disease in patients with CKD.  As a result, it may overestimate the risk and have poor discriminatory power in the CKD population. All these indicate the need for the development of more appropriate risk factors to assess the CVD risk among CKD patients.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (chronic kidney failure)","Scientific Approaches
•	A retrospective cohort study will be conducted to create a model capable of predicting CVD using traditional and non-traditional risk factors of CVD in patients with CKD. The study will include CVD patients with CKD: age 18-80, CKD stage 1-5(including patients on dialysis), in accordance with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI).
•	The baseline data collection will include but not limited to age, sex, CKD stage, CVD’s history, medications history as well as traditional CVD risk factors.
•	Baseline renal functions and other parameters related to CVD will be assessed and those include: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP).
•	To investigate the association between CVD in CKD patients and potential risk factors, Cox Proportional-Hazards model will be used for the statistical analysis.","Anticipated Findings
•	Creating a model using traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes at el) and non-traditional risk factors (albuminuria, anemia at el) can estimate the risk of CVD in patients with CKD.

The data will include information on past SARS-CoV-2 infections, type I and II diabetes, demographic characteristics, and other hormone/endocrine conditions, mental health or substance use conditions, and cancer. Data will be stratified to assess the change in risk of these conditions for underserved patient populations.","Anticipated Findings
The primary hypothesis is SARS-CoV-2 will be a risk factor for the onset of diabetes.  The secondary hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 is a predisposing factor for other chronic diseases.  Additionally, the proposed study will explore if SARS-CoV-2 is associated with other hormone/endocrine conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism), mental health or substance use of conditions (e.g., alcohol use disorder), and cancer (e.g., kidney cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer).  Findings have clinical implications for prevention (e.g., vaccines), screenings, and treatments, post SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We want to identify and characterize important disease manifestations, serologic profiles, and treatments for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There are known to be differences in these between men and women, and also among different racial groups within the United States. We are interested in also studying the variation of these with sex, race, and socioeconomic factors. Additionally comorbidities and other health characteristic such as BMI or smoking history are believed to be important in disease outcomes including other system involvement or cardiovascular events. There have not been many large databases or study cohorts with SLE patients that include detailed information about these factors that are believed to be clinically important so the All of Us database provides a unique opportunity for observational study of these factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (systemic lupus erythematosus)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to report observational data of a cross-sectional cohort of all adult patients from the All of Us database who have a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in EHR records. We will make a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics including sex, age, race, annual household income, education level, self-reported quality of life, and smoking status. Subsequent analyses will compare the presence of organ specific manifestations of SLE and of cardiovascular events between male and female participants and between races using presence of EHR codes. We will use self-reported survey data to describe the frequency of barriers to healthcare access. We will also estimate the validity of self-report of SLE by comparing patient reported history of SLE with EHR documentation of this diagnosis.","Anticipated Findings
Male patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are described across multiple studies to often develop more severe disease. Patients with SLE in the United among specific racial groups, including black and Hispanic patients, have also been described to develop more severe disease. These are attributed to a combination of genetic variance in the underlying disease and to social and environmental factors. Therefore, we anticipate men may have more frequent organ specific disease manifestations than women with SLE. Cardiovascular events are more common in men so we anticipate a higher rate of events in men with SLE. There is limited data on whether serologic positivity important to SLE is more prevalent among men than women so this prediction is less clear. This will be valuable as there is limited data characterizing SLE in men in a large cohort, or in characterizing the barriers to healthcare access among patients with SLE, which are potential targets for care improvement.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It is unclear if traditional clinical risk scores can adequately quantify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in underrepresented study populations.

1. How does the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk differ between commonly represented and underrepresented populations?
2. Do traditional clinical risk scores for atherosclerotic cardiovascular perform similarly in diverse populations? If not, can this be addressed with new or modified clinical risk scores?
3. Can we develop polygenic risk scores for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and related risk factors for diverse populations?

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our study will look at how cardiovascular disease comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors differ by sex in those who are COVID-19 positive versus negative. This question is important because there is a lack of public knowledge on the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular health and how this may differ between men and women. Therefore, we are interested in analyzing prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors according to COVID-19 test positivity.  Since there are some sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes, we wish to examine how comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors may differ between men and women.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (COVID-19, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure)","Scientific Approaches
We will use the cohort builder to find participants who tested positive for COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria will include cardiovascular risk factors, behaviors and comorbidities. Our exclusion criteria will include people who tested negative for COVID-19. We will then create a second cohort of participants who have tested negative for COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria will remain the same as the first cohort, but this time the exclusion criteria will include people who tested positive for COVID-19. We will also stratify our cohorts into male versus female. After, we will create a dataset builder, and generate concept sets on cardiovascular risk factors (eg hypertension, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), behaviors (diet, smoking, physical activity), and comorbidities (prior history of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, COPD, diabetes). We will then import the data to Jupyter Notebook and write code in R to analyze our data.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study are that males who tested positive for COVID-19 will have the most cardiovascular risk factors, followed by males who tested negative for COVID-19, females who tested positive for COVID-19, and lastly, females who tested negative for COVID-19. We expect that males who tested positive for COVID-19 will be more likely to have hypertension, diabetes and less physical activity compared to females.

Both incidence & mortality of prostate cancer are significantly higher in patients who identify as black as compared to other race groups (Odedina et al 2009).

We are interested in investigating the relationship between SDOH and 1. Cardiovascular disease end points including but not limited to stroke, MI, and hospitalization for HF.  2. Mortality
This analysis will enhance understanding of how different demographics are affected by prostate cancer. Understanding how factors such as education, access to healthcare, amongst other SDOH may play into both cardiovascular outcomes and mortality could potentially help shape treatment plans that are better catered to the specific needs of specific patient populations. This would be particularly helpful for patients that come from historically underserved populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Population: Our population of interest is prostate cancer patients in the US.
Outcome: We want to investigate mortality and cardiovascular disease as outcomes.
Exposure: SDOH such as education, economic measures (income for example), physical infrastructure, access to healthcare, and other relevant determinants
Covariates: race, age, location, BMI, smoking history, alcohol use, comorbidities (such as diabetes, hypertension etc), occupation, lifestyle habits (sedentary, active etc)
Analysis: We plan to use longitudinal data analysis to investigate the outcomes listed above.

We will separate our analysis for the two sets of outcomes: cardiovascular disease, as well as cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.","Anticipated Findings
Studies have been conducted to investigate relationships between specific SDOHs and mortality, particularly to try and understand the large racial disparity in outcomes. Some have shown that low-income may lead to higher mortality rates (Tewari et al 2009). Furthermore, over time as changes in screening recommendations and interventions have been complemented, there has been in a decrease in risk associated with prostate cancer (Cooperberg et al 2003). In regards to our interest in CVD, studies have shown a similar relationship between lower income and CVD incidence (Kreatsoulas and Anand 2010). Through our analysis, we will evaluate this association in men with prostate cancer population. We anticipate that analysis using the comprehensive All of Us data will provide further insight into how the different SDOHs and treatment types impact outcome, in particular since we would be able to analyze multiple social determinants simultaneously, unlike in prior papers.","Demographic Categories of Interest

NF1 is one of the genes with hypermutable patterns across the genome. Although primarily associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1 is also reported to have many manifestations in ophthalmologic, vascular, glioma, and central neuro systems. In the cardiovascular system, renal artery stenosis is considered one of the major causes of hypertension for patients with NF. However, the NF1 penetrance on the renal artery stenosis is still not clearly defined and the epistasis of other genes is also poorly understood.  Here we want to explore 1) the penetrance rate in the general population; 2) the epistasis between NF1 and other genes.","Project Purpose(s)

All variants were annotated by Annovar with the following databases: gnomAD population frequency (v2), dbNSFP (v3.5), CADD score (v1.3), and ClinVar database.
All variants were predicted to be deleterious (ie: disease-causing) by in silico analysis if meeting any of the following sets of criteria: 1) nonsynonymous variant with phred CADD score > 20 and gnomAD allele frequency < 0.01%; 2) variants with considered to have evidence of pathogenicity according to the predicted loss of function (start-loss, stop-loss, stop-gain, frameshift indels, or splice-site) or non-frameshift indels, with gnomAD allele frequency < 0.01%; or 3) defined as likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in ClinVar.
Then the annotated variants and the clinical phenotype information from the same individuals will be converted to a contingency table and tested by Fisher's exact test.","Anticipated Findings
1. Get the penetrance rate between NF1 and RAS;
2. Identify the potential epistasis between NF1 and other genes.
By exploring the genetic basis between NF1 and RAS, our study may have many scientific and clinical implications: 1) understand the effects of NF1 on RAS and the potential modifier genes; 2) the consulting implications for probands with annotated ""deleterious"" NF1 variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Based on early studies from the genetics community, we envision being able to answer salient research questions in the field of cardiovascular genetics. First, what are the causal genes for vascular disease, aneurysmal disease, and their risk factors ? Second, which genes are uniquely responsible for driving vascular disease and/or aneurysmal disease in the peripheral vascular bed and not in other vascular territories? Third, will a set of genotypes allow us to predict who will be at highest risk for severe vascular disease, including chronic limb threatening ischemia? While substantial work has been performed in establishing the genetic determinants of vascular diseases, including PAD, coronary disease, carotid disease, and aortic aneurysm (abdominal and thoracic), disentangling the genes that specifically affect one disease process or another (or, one vascular bed or another) remains elusive. We intend to us the All of Us resource to answer these key questions, as outlined below.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (vascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The last decade of genetic association analysis has demonstrated that the effects of common DNA sequence variants are modest (each individual mutation identified increases disease risk by ~2-20%) and thus, large sample sizes will be necessary to fully elucidate the spectrum of common vascular disease mutations within the population.  We intend to leverage the following methods for genomic analysis:
1) Discovery Genome-wide Association Study analysis in the common variant space
2) Explore the phenotype consequences of vascular disease risk variants
3) To associate predicted loss-of-function variation with vascular disease leveraging whole genome sequencing data
4) Bayesian tools to combine genomic data with publicly available gene-expression data to identify potential therapeutic targets (ie, colocalization analyses with data from repositories like GTEx)
5) Bayesian tools to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for genomic risk prediction, including for disease progression","Anticipated Findings
We believe our findings will contribute to the body of scientific literature through the identification of:
1) Novel genes and variants associated with vascular disease
2) Genes and variants that target one specific type of vascular disease over another
3) Genes and variants that target one vascular bed over another
4) The spectrum of consequences for disease-associated variants
5) Individuals at the highest risk of progressive disease through genomic risk prediction
In each of these cases, the above data can be used to prioritize causal genes and pathways for novel treatments. Through the discovery of vascular disease-associated genes and describing the range of effects of disease-associated variants, we aim to elucidate key insights of biologic and pharmacologic potential. We hope that the identification of such risk factors, cell types, and genes may be used to inform clinical care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The exact genetic origins and the molecular mechanisms of cardiomyopathies are still largely unknown. GWAS studies have been informative in identifying variants that lead to cardiovascular disease. However, attributing the molecular function to significantly enriched variants  and putting these variants into the context of disease mechanism remains challenging. We hypothesize that variants impact the expression of genes and these genes should be expressed by a cell type involved in the disease process. By filtering variants expressed by cardiac cell type populations and performing gene regulatory network analysis, we will enhance our ability to identify cardiovascular disease regulatory mechanisms.","Project Purpose(s)

Using this GWAS data, we will link variants associated with each cardiovascular disease to a list of genes predicated to be impacted by these variants (eQTL analysis). The genes will be grouped into cardiac cell types expressing these genes using our single cell RNA-seq analysis performed on mouse and human heart tissue (as well as publicly available mouse and human heart atlases).

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women over the age of 65 in the United States, men account for more than half of the deaths due to CVD. Moreover, evidence suggests that cardiovascular disparities exist among men, such that those who identify as sexual minorities are more likely to experience poor cardiovascular health as compared to heterosexuals. The objective of this proposal is to examine physiological and behavioral mechanisms linking self-reported discrimination to ambulatory blood pressure, an intermediate outcome used to assess subclinical cardiovascular disease, in a racially diverse group of YSMM aged 18-35.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the world and also in the United States.  Screening asymptomatic patients at high risk for CHD is essential in preventing morbidity and mortality related to ASCVD. The traditional risk factor assessment tools fall short in identifying intermediate risk patients. More biomarkers are therefore needed to improve risk stratification in this risk category. The role of iron-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of CVD has been demonstrated in several animal models its role in humans is still controversial partly because of the use of iron metrics that are strongly influenced not only by systemic and tissue iron burden but also by inflammation and also the cross-sectional nature of the past studies . We propose to improve on previous analyses by focusing on a better characterized cohort derived from a large longitudinal epidemiological study together with applying more sophisticated statistical analysis.","Project Purpose(s)

Cardiovascular disease risk is an important determinant of how we treat patients. Preventive medications can reduce future risk, but they are associated with both financial and biological side-effects.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) includes stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), documented coronary artery disease (CAD) with stable angina, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), coronary or other arterial revascularization, peripheral vascular disease with or without claudication, and aortic aneurysm. In clinical practice, physicians will also include asymptomatic CAD (meaning, without angina)  with demonstrable ischemia on a stress test.
We plan to utilize data from adults greater than 18 years of age in the All of Us Research study who are free of ASCVD, and have complete data for inputs in the Pooled Cohort Equation (age, gender, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure (BP), BP medications, diabetes status, and smoking status).
We propose to then use the PCE to assess accuracy of risk prediction in the multi-ethnic All of Us cohort.","Anticipated Findings
