We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This study aims to leverage the increasing accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) and digital health data for genomic discovery and personalized medicine. The focus includes biobanks, wearable devices, and comprehensive environmental factor measurement. Cohort studies emphasize lifestyle's role in cardiovascular risk, particularly in interaction with CAD-PRS. The study proposes creating a robust risk prediction model, utilizing both genetic and non-genetic factors. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis will interpret predictors, nonlinear interactions, and identify novel risk factors. The goal is an actionable algorithm offering personalized preventive measures for enhanced cardiovascular care and precision medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (coronary artery disease)","Scientific Approaches
This study involves three main steps: 1) Assembling a biobank dataset with stringent preprocessing, addressing genotype imputation biases and harmonizing diverse sequencing platforms. 2) Utilizing ensemble machine learning models to integrate genetic and non-genetic risk factors for actionable outcomes, predicting baseline risk and imputing missing phenotypes. 3) Implementing an expanded model to uncover missing heritability, using an autoencoder-based imputation approach and exploring high-pathogenicity rare variants. These steps aim to enhance the accuracy and applicability of polygenic risk score research.","Anticipated Findings
The study anticipates refining polygenic risk scores (PRS) for cardiovascular disease by assembling a robust biobank dataset, addressing genotype imputation biases, and employing ensemble machine learning models. Findings are expected to yield actionable outcomes, providing personalized risk predictions and insights into behavioral interventions. The exploration of missing heritability, using advanced imputation and rare variant analysis, adds novelty. Overall, the study contributes by overcoming methodological challenges, improving accuracy, and advancing understanding of the intricate interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors in cardiovascular risk. The emphasis on precision medicine holds potential for enhanced preventive strategies and informed clinical decision-making, thereby advancing the field.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The primary scientific inquiry we aim to investigate revolves around ascertaining whether the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents yields additional cardiovascular benefits in comparison to the inhibition of either target in isolation, particularly in high-risk patients.
This research question holds significant importance as prevailing guidelines advocate for a more intensive management approach for type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. However, a substantial number of these patients struggle to attain the recommended treatment targets, even with maximal therapy. By examining the combined effects on blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation through the inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents , as demonstrated in this study, we intend to establish a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of a combined inhibitor approach.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes and CVD)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Dataset:
Utilize individual-level data from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD. Identify those at high risk who fail to achieve target blood glucose levels despite being on the maximum tolerated therapy for blood glucose reduction.
Methods:
Stratify participants based on genetic variants that are predictive of higher or lower levels. Subsequently, compare the rates of blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular events.
Analyses:
Utilize linear regression models to quantify the differences in blood glucose levels based on specific genotypes. Additionally, employ Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with different genotypes.
Test for interactions between genetic variants and the treatment effects of inhibitors on both blood glucose levels and clinical events.","Anticipated Findings
If genetic proxies confirm greater blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular benefit from blood glucose lowering variants, it would provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting combined pharmacological as a novel strategy for incremental risk reduction in high-risk patients, not at blood glucose goal. This would genetically validate the approach and inform the design of an outcomes trial directly comparing dual inhibition to individual inhibition alone","Demographic Categories of Interest

Specifically, it recognizes the need for equity-focused health system interventions to prevent, detect, control, and manage hypertension and high cholesterol. Both grants encourage the tracking and monitoring clinical and social services and support needs measures, the implementation of team-based care, and linking community resources and clinical services.
Research question: What are the social service and support needs most often identified as barriers to care in patients with, or at risk of, CVD?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will aim to identify the social service and support needs of individuals living in rural areas who have a history of CVD, or who are considered to be at high risk of developing CVD (i.e., hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, etc.). We will utilize a combination of survey questions and procedure concepts to identify rurality, while social needs will be identified using survey questions that relate to social determinants of health, healthcare access and utilization, lifestyle, and demographic indices. CVD and associated conditions will be identified using the EHR ""conditions"" domain (i.e., hypertensive heart disease, neurocirculatory asthenia, and ""at increased risk of cardiovascular disease""), the Labs & Measurements concept, and procedure concept ""Annual, face-to-face intensive behavioral therapy for CVD..."". We will utilize the cohort builder, concept set select, dataset builder, and Jupyter Notebook tools to build an appropriate analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that individuals with, or at high risk of, CVD will face primarily access to care and transportation barriers,  socioeconomic barriers, and food insecurity at a greater frequency than those without CVD or related conditions. We hope that these findings provide insight into the critical social service needs those most often affect CVD prevention and management, and provide a focal point for the implementation of social service and support needs focused programming.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The BP PRS will be constructed using the PRS-CS approach. The PRS-CS is a Bayesian approach to computing PRS that derives each genetic variant’s posterior mean effect size (weight) from the prior GWAS base data while accounting for the LD using the 1000 Genomes as the reference population. We will use the ϕ values set to 10^-2, 10^-4, 10^-6, and auto, with a p-value threshold of 0.05. Unlike other Bayesian methods such as LDPred, PRS-CS-auto does not require separate derivation and validation subcohorts.
Tools: Plink 2.0; R Statistical Software;","Anticipated Findings
In this comprehensive investigation involving a multi-ethnic cohort of American adults, we anticipate finding a robust cross-sectional association of multi-ethnic BP PRS (polygenic risk score) with BP traits overall and across subgroups of self-identified race/ethnicity was observed.
Second, we anticipate that individuals at an increased genetic risk for elevated BP (measured using BP PRS) are also predisposed individuals to an increased risk of adverse CV events such as heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), or stroke, after accounting for traditional CV risk factors (ACC/AHA Pooled Cohorts Equation [PCE]).
Third, we anticipate that among those with a high genetic predisposition to elevated BP, a low traditional CV risk factor burden (low ACC/AHA PCE risk) will be associated with a lower risk of adverse CV events.
Lastly, in a multi-ethnic cohort of middle-aged adults, BP PRS will provide a modest improvement in adverse CV risk prediction beyond the ACC/AHA PCE.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow acquire somatic mutations that lead to overgrowth of a genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells. The prevalence of CHIP detectable through next-generation sequencing of blood DNA is up to 10% of adults >70 years and nearly 20% of adults >90 years. CHIP has major implications for human health as a risk factor for   age-related chronic diseases including hematologic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, and all-cause mortality.

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Aging-Related Diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians. The Li Lab here at UC Irvine uses a variety of computational methods to find different types of genomic patterns in an unbiased manner. With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging. Also, if we can find genetic reasons that explain why supercentenarians avoid aging-related diseases, we may even be able to identify therapeutic targets and treatments for these diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) has traditionally been viewed as a disease of men, new evidence suggests the existence of distinct differences in the risk factors, development, and outcomes between the two sexes.  For example, our recent studies have revealed that the genetic factors for several intermediate cardiometabolic traits, represent potentially novel sex-specific mechanisms for CVD. In addition to sexually dimorphic associations, we intend to build upon our research on variants specifically associated with myocardial infarction. This project proposes to build on our observations using genetic and clinical cardiometabolic phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (coronary artery disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
A series of analyses will be sex-stratified genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) for CVD-related binary traits in the full dataset.  For GWAS of discrete traits, we are interested in coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) as clinical outcomes. We will be using unbiased genetic analysis using whole genome sequencing data with statistical genetic analyses to uncover common and rare variants associated with discrete cardiometabolic clinical traits.","Anticipated Findings
Our previous studies have identified potentially novel sexually dimorphic mechanisms for the development of CVD. Although these results support the concept that the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease in women may differ from men, they also raise several important unanswered questions from a genetics perspective such as what are the mechanisms by which other loci in the genome influence plasma levels of metabolites and lipid species of interest and do they exhibit sexually dimorphic associations with CVD phenotypes?  Similarly, little is known about the genetic determinants that are specifically associated with MI among patients with CAD compared to those that drive atherogenesis. Although previous studies of ours have identified novel variants associated specifically with MI, we believe there are additional loci that are MI specific. Thus, identifying genes involved in the complex pathological processes leading to MI/plaque rupture could have important clinical implications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We Intend to study and understand the association of physical activity with cardiovascular diseases in participants with Fitbit data. There is a critical need to understand whether physical inactivity contributes to the disparity in cardiovascular disease in individuals of different racial/ethnic and sexual orientation/gender identity (SOGI) groups. By exploring the Fitbit data on AoU, we are aiming: 1) to see if there are ways we can use the Fitbit data to support the early detection of disease, such as early detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib); 2) to determine whether intense exercise can improve the resting heart rate; 3) to determine if the Fitbit data can be used to quantitively study the length of sleep; 4) to understand whether the heart rate and exercise level varies by race after adjusting for the social determinant of health (SDOH), lifestyle as well as demographic characteristics; 5) to investigate the interplay of physical activity, RHR and cardiovascular outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
There are four datasets we will use: EHR domains, physical measurement, Fitbit, and survey (lifestyle, family history, SDOH). Below are key research methods and tools: 1, To assess the association between the intensity of physical activity and resting heart rate (RHR), we will include all participants who shared Fitbit data. To predict the proportion of maximum heart rate on minute-level, we will use an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). To balance the interpretability and overfitting, we will conduct machine learning models, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive LSTM to estimate the outcome as secondary analysis. 2, To investigate the interplay of physical activity, RHR and cardiovascular outcomes, we will use Cox proportional hazard regressions to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary outcomes, MACE, among participants by intensity groups, adjusted for confounders at the index date.","Anticipated Findings
First, through this study, we can standardize the data collection process, which fills a gap on how to handle Fitbit data in retrospectives studies. Next, we might discover some specific heart rate patterns that are associated with the increase in AFib, which could lead to early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Furthermore, our study will provide a better understanding of disparities in cardiovascular diseases in vulnerable individuals with varied backgrounds, such as elderly, cancers, which may in turn, lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AFib, thus leading to further studies. With these potential findings, we could advance our understanding of the progression of CVD, and have the potential for clinical translation to precision CVD prevention, and reduce cardiovascular disparities in individuals in a personalized manner.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), encompassing conditions like stroke and heart attack, remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While traditional risk factors such as diet, exercise, and genetics are well-documented, the potential impact of novel environmental exposures, particularly lithium and pesticides, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge presents an urgent need for comprehensive research to understand these relationships better.
This research is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses a relatively unexplored area of environmental health. Understanding the role of lithium, commonly found in water supplies and used in various industries, and pesticides, widely used in agriculture, in the development of heart attacks and strokes could be significant in reducing the global burden of these diseases. Furthermore, this study could inform policy makers, guiding regulations on environmental exposures and public health advisories.","Project Purpose(s)

Advanced statistical methods will be used to control for confounding variables, ensuring the validity of the findings.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study could range from establishing a clear correlation between these novel exposures and increased CVD risk, to identifying no significant relationship. In cases where a positive association is found, the results could pave the way for further research into mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic interventions, and targeted public health strategies. Even in the absence of a significant association, the findings would be valuable in ruling out these exposures as major risk factors, refining the focus for future CVD research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Do higher rates of chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases in Black participants account for higher rates of pneumococcal vaccination among this group? Are there disparities among people with chronic diseases with regards to vaccination rates?
Immunizations are one of the most important and effective preventative health measures available, but relative to public health goals, are underutilized in adults. Developing a better understanding of how vaccines are used positions us to develop strategies to mitigate modifiable risk factors and improve vaccination rates. Results from our study will address a knowledge gap in understanding data characteristics available in the All of Us dataset for younger adult participants who have received pneumococcal vaccines. Results from this study is intended to provide us with stronger justification for access to medical and pharmacy claims data to develop prediction models on which variables have the highest amplitude of impact.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
The All of Us database will be used as a source population for a convenience sample in this cross-sectional study to characterize the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of adults who receive pneumococcal vaccines as adults.  These categories of factors will also be used to compare groups of participants who completed the hepatitis B and HPV vaccine series with those who started, but did not complete these vaccine series. Descriptive statistics, correlations and cross-tabulation will be used to describe specific differences in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, gender-based, and health- and lifestyle-related determinants of the use of vaccines in patients included in this unique database. Inferential analysis, including an emerging methodology intended to reduce the biasing effects of missing data will also be applied.","Anticipated Findings
This proposed study provides a cross-sectional evaluation of the All of Us program data to develop a baseline understanding of the relevant and available vaccination data. Most existing literature describing adult vaccination rates are based on self-reports and few focus on correlating health data. Comprehensive data regarding vaccination rates exist, but lack investigation to specific health, and sociodemographic characteristics. More importantly descriptions of vaccine studies have been mainly limited to individual vaccine types. This analysis is a follow up study of previous work utilizing the All of Us database which identified vaccination disparities consistent with the published literature. The use of bias reduction methods also has important implication for a variety of other research questions applied to large EHR databases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Heart failure (HF) is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease. It significantly reduces quality of life, results in frequent hospitalizations, and causes many deaths. Access to care is therefore critical for patients with heart failure in preventing morbidity and mortality. However, research on barriers to care in patients with heart failure is limited, especially for minority groups (sex and gender minority, racial and ethnic minority). This is an important area of study as addressing these disparities can lead to improved outcomes for heart failure patients.
Specifically, the questions are:
What are the barriers to healthcare access for minority groups with heart failure?
How do these barriers contribute to the disparities in heart failure outcomes among these groups?
What interventions can effectively reduce these barriers and improve access to care for all patients with heart failure","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
Our study will utilize a dataset of patients with heart failure, identified using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes. We will categorize these patients into two groups: those belonging to sex and gender minorities (SGM) — defined as individuals with one or more minoritized identities in relation to their sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or sexual orientation — and those identified as racial and ethnic minorities, based on self-reported race and ethnicity (e.g., American Indians, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders; Blacks; Hispanics). To analyze the data, we will employ multivariable logistic regression to explore the association between minority status and the experience of barriers to care.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate discovering that minority patients with heart failure face more substantial barriers to care, particularly in specific areas we aim to pinpoint. By identifying these critical zones, our findings will enable healthcare practitioners to target interventions more effectively and shed light on broader systemic issues affecting minority patients at both individual and institutional levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We aim to validate a new algorithm for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk within the All of Us research dataset. Specific questions we will ask are:
1. How does the new risk prediction algorithm perform regarding the calibration and discrimination among All of US dataset? Calibration refers to the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, while discrimination refers to the algorithm's ability to distinguish between individuals who will experience a CVD event and those who will not.
2. How does the performance of the new self-report algorithm compare to previous commonly used prediction models, such as the Framingham Risk Score, which require more measurements.
We hypothesize that the new algorithm for CVD events prediction will have good calibration and discrimination. Furthermore, we anticipate that the predictive capacity of this novel algorithm will be non-inferior to the traditional Framingham score.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
In this study, we will assess the predictive capability of a new algorithm developed by Huma Therapeutics Limited (London, United Kingdom) within the UK BioBank by using the All of Us dataset. To evaluate its performance, we will exclude participants who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. CVD in our study is defined as a composite outcome including myocardial infarction, heart failure, angina pectoris or other chronic ischemic disease, stroke, and transient ischemic attack.
To assess the predictive accuracy of the new algorithm, we will employ Cox's proportional hazards model and calculate the C-index and ROC AUC in STATA. Furthermore, we will conduct a comparison between the performance of the new algorithm and the Framingham score, a commonly used prediction model for CVD. This comparative analysis will provide insights into the relative effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to the established Framingham score.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we will evaluate the performance of the new algorithm. We expect to evaluate the calibration and discrimination of the new algorithm when applied to the All of Us dataset. By comparing the new algorithm's performance with the widely used Framingham score, we aim to determine if the new algorithm is non-inferior to the traditional prediction model in terms of prediction accuracy. This comparison will provide insights into the effectiveness and potential advantages of the new algorithm.
These findings of this study would contribute to the prediction of CVD by providing a potentially reliable tool for assessing CVD risk in the general population, and serving as an alternative or complementary tool for clinicians and researchers in assessing CVD risk. The progression in CVD prediction will assist in improving early recognition of CVD risk, enabling early interventions, and promoting","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the United States. Many cardiovascular diseases initiate with dysfunctional blood vessels leading to blockages, or occlusions. Our research group studies how dysfunction of the cells that line the inside of blood vessels, endothelial cells, can lead to the development of diseased blood vessels. We have previously identified a list of candidate proteins which we hypothesize may be important in regulating vessel health. While we study the role of these proteins using cell culture models, we plan to use the All of Us database to identify population-level genetic variations in our candidate proteins which lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases. By learning more about how genetics can change the function of endothelial cells and therefore blood vessel health, we can identify potential targets for pharmaceuticals to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Once we identify a correlation between a genetic mutation and a disease, we will validate that the mutation causes disease using cell culture and animal models.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to determine whether persons who carry mutations in our candidate proteins are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease in their lifetime. If we identify common mutations which lead to the development of disease, we will further study these specific mutations to better understand the function of the candidate protein or attempt to develop therapeutics to mitigate the risk for cardiovascular diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern.

What are the specific phenotypes of syndemics and how do they interact across multiple levels of structure, social, interpersonal, individual, and biological levels?
Is there an association of syndemic phenotypes with cardiovascular diseases?
These questions are important because social determinants of health tend to interact with interpersonal, individual, and biological factors and understanding phenotypes of these interactions may help us identify better prevention strategies for cardiovascular diseases and tailored to those living with HIV.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize national health and nutrition examination surveys that include data on dietary habits, datasets from healthcare providers or national health databases that include information on cardiovascular health indicators among Chinese Americans, and demographic and Socioeconomic information including age, gender, socio-economic status, level of education, and degree of acculturation. We probably will use longitudinal Study and comparable study to analyze health outcomes of Chinese Americans following traditional diets with those adopting more Westernized diets and changes over time in dietary habits and their impact on cardiovascular health. We will employ statistical software like SPSS, SAS, or R for data analysis. These tools can handle large datasets and perform various statistical tests.","Anticipated Findings
Our study is expected to categorize the predominant dietary patterns among Chinese Americans, encompassing traditional Chinese diets, Westernized diets, or a combination of both. A key anticipated outcome is the establishment of clear correlations, or the absence thereof, between specific dietary patterns and various indicators of cardiovascular health. This research will contribute significantly to the broader understanding of how cultural and lifestyle factors influence health outcomes, particularly in immigrant populations. It will enrich the fields of nutritional epidemiology and multicultural health studies. The anticipated findings from our study have the potential to greatly enhance our comprehension of the interplay between diet, culture, and health. These findings could lay the groundwork for more informed and culturally tailored health advice, public health policies, and directions for future research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition consisting of lifelong elevated LDL cholesterol levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Variants in three genes involved in LDL receptor function, LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, account for most cases. Among Western populations, the prevalence of FH has been reported to be between 1:212 to 1:331. African ancestry individuals are underrepresented in submissions to genetic resources used to determine variant pathogenicity and there are no known reports on the prevalence of FH in those populations. Therefore, the study aims to create an African ancestry cohort to assess frequency of FH variants and outcomes such as LDL levels, use of lipid-lowering medications, and ASCVD risk among individuals in this cohort to better understand the burden of FH in this population.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to run ADMIXTURE on genetic data from All of Us and other large multi-ethnic cohorts to create an African ancestry cohort. We then will assess sequence variants in the three FH genes from this cohort for pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Finally we will compare outcomes such as lipid levels , use of lipid lowering medications, and ASCVD risk among those with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, a VUS, and without any such variant.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate finding several variants in the three known FH genes that are rare and/or poorly characterized in primarily European ancestry cohorts that confer increased risk for high LDL levels and ASCVD risk. We expect that many of the individuals with these variants will have not been adequately screened and treated for FH, and thus represent a population that could see benefits in care and lifespan with increased testing for FH variants and LDL cholesterol levels earlier in life.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in the United States. Despite this, only 44% of women surveyed in a 2019 American Heart Association survey were able to correctly identify CVD as the leading cause of death among women. Recently, there is growing recognition that sex-specific and reproductive factors including premature menopause and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase risk of CVD. This acknowledgement highlights the importance of CV risk modification and counseling in a population of women who were previously considered to be low risk for future CV events.

Do providers prescribe statins for hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 DM less often in patients with NASH than those without NASH?
PCP's are reluctant to prescribe statins to patient's with abnormal liver function tests because of the known risk of hepatotoxicity associated with statin use. However, statins have not only been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and type 2 Diabetes, but have also been proven to have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic properties and may thus inhibit progression from simple steatosis to fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
The goal of this study is to look at a diverse panel of patients to evaluate the prescribing patterns for statins in patients both with and without NASH and hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

Our goal is to examine differences in cardiovascular (CV) health between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM adults (ages 18 and over). Our primary aim is to assess differences in CV risk behaviors (such as tobacco use and physical activity), health factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol), and CV diagnoses (such as heart attack and stroke). We will also explore potential racial, ethnic, education, income, and geographic location differences CV health within SGM individuals. This project is led by Dr. Billy Caceres who is a CV nurse scientist and a nationally recognized expert on the CV health of SGM individuals. There is growing evidence showing that SGM adults are at greater risk for CV disease than non-SGM individuals. However, potential reasons for these differences are not understood. Findings of this analysis will inform future research and interventions that will focus on specific CV risk factors to improve the CV health of SGM adults.","Project Purpose(s)

Further, we hypothesize that these differences will be greater among SGM racial and ethnic minorities. We expect this work will inform future research that focuses on specific subgroups of SGM individuals that are most at risk for CV disease (such as bisexual or transgender individuals).

Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity. Despite the increasing use of GLP-1 RA, their impact on diabetic retinopathy remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence on the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most of this evidence stems from the multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs, which have defined DR differently. Most of the other studies have not been large enough to adequately answer this question. This study aims to investigate the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and DR and diabetic macular edema progression via the All of Us research database. We will also determine whether lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse access to GLP-1 RA and thus worse DR.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
To determine if there is an association between use of GLP-1 RAs and progression/presence of diabetic retinopathy (none/NPDR/PDR) or diabetic macular edema that required treatment in the form of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or corticosteroid (i.e., triamcinolone) injection, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Two cohorts: One on GLP-1 RA therapy and the other not on GLP-1 RA therapy. Only patients with type 2 DM. Patients should not have PDR prior to initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy. Patients should be treatment-naive (no prior intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy).
Covariates: Age at diagnosis of DM, sex, birth country, race/ethnicity, education level, insurance status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, smoking history, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI).
Multivariate logistic regression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that GLP-1 RA therapy is not associated with progression or presence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema that requires treatment in the form of intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy. As the literature currently has conflicting evidence on this question, we hope this study will provide further guidance on this matter. Additionally, we hope that this study will encourage primary care physicians and endocrinologists to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus aggressively to minimize all the associated systemic complications of diabetes mellitus including worsening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema from worsening control of blood glycemic levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will explore machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are at substantially increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.  A reliable predictive model could be very helpful for identifying individuals at the greatest risk so that they can modify lifestyle and health habits and their physicians can consider pharmacologic interventions and closer monitoring.
We are particularly interested in determining whether the model is as effective for historically underrepresented groups as it is for historically well represented groups.  Historically, medical studies examining prognostic predictors, including for cardiac health have focused on predominantly Caucasian populations and might not be as applicable to underrepresented minorities.

Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is among the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases (1-2 events per 1000 persons per year) and results from an imbalance of hemostasis regulation, resulting in pathologic coagulation and the formation of blood clots. Clinically, VTE is defined as deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal. It is a complex disease, known to have both environmental and genetic determinants. By leveraging large-scale biobanks with genetic information, such as All of Us, we will identify genetic loci significantly associated with VTE risk. These findings could help to uncover novel biological pathways involved in thrombosis and find new therapeutic targets to improve VTE prevention and treatment.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Venous thromboembolism (VTE))
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will employ medical records codes for common clinical thrombosis diagnoses to define “cases”, and apply the absence of codes to be “controls”.  We will apply genome-wide association (GWAS) SNP studies to these case and control groupings to identify any potential genetic loci. These will then be further validated and compared to other large Biobank GWAS results for VTE to provide a higher level of evidence for their veracity.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate we will find new and existing genetic loci that contribute to thrombosis disorders. These genes may help explain why some individuals experience higher risk and may be able to be combined into genetic risk scores that could have potential clinical applicability. Future researchers may also be able to perform basic functional and mechanistic investigations of identified genes to understand the biological basis and whether thrombosis risk can be potentially reduced for some individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

If time allows, short read genome sequencing on the APOE gene will be extracted in Alzheimer's patients to outline specific APOE single nucleotide polymorphisms to examine risk of CVD (E2-4 mutations).  Estrogen levels will be extracted to plot levels against hypertensive status.  The study will focus on patients in the 50+ age range, and a control will be obtained from the 18-35 demographic.  Progesterone will also be a variable included in the estrogen levels.

Based on previous results on the four diseases found the primary incidence rates was found within white females in mid stage of life.  Menopausal hormonal shifts were hypothesized to be linked to an increased risk of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insomnia, and sleep apnea, which each contributed to an elevated CVD occurrence.  Based on previous findings the All of Us database needed more diversity to properly evaluate the spread of risk across the various populations included in the study.  The findings will contribute the importance of developing additional diagnostic tests by increasing funding for womens health programs to assist with awareness for the affected demographics.  Moreover by increasing funding more research intervention strategies may be developed to provide education on lowering risk of CVD in postmenopausal females.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Can deep learning be applied to ECG data to detect those with arrhythmias of monogenic inheritance? Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for around half of cardiovascular deaths in the United States (US). SCD heritable risk factors contribute to the risk of SCD through monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS). However, routine clinical genomic testing of arrhythmias is inaccessible by its undetermined timeline for large scale employment, complicated by cost and requirement of expert interpretation at large scale. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical modality used to measure electrical activity of the heart, serving as a first-line diagnostic touchpoint for patients, with and without suspected cardiac abnormalities. This study proposes to leverage DL to identify ECG features that indicate monogenic risk of SCD using electronic health record (EHR) and ECG data.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Monogenic arrythmias)","Scientific Approaches
To improve the identification of monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes in individuals of diverse ancestry, I will use a deep learning architecture to classify those with genotype-positive disease using clinical and ECG data. This will require use of genomics, electronic health records (EHR), and ECG datasets and coding with SQL and Python in the Research Notebook. While models have been created to classify these different conditions independently, an algorithm has yet to be developed that will classify monogenic predisposition to arrhythmia, with appreciation for ancestry diversity. To determine algorithm utility, I will determine the proportion of individuals with a monogenic inherited arrhythmia diagnosis in their EHR to ascertain new detected cases.  I hypothesize that by integrating data from All of Us, this algorithm will apply widely to diverse populations.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to find a model that can increase selection of patients of diverse ancestry who are genotype positive for monogenic IAS. I will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine missed diagnoses not captured by EHR and number of averted SCD with earlier diagnosis. With access to longitudinal medical record information, I am well positioned to discover non-traditional ECG signatures of patients with monogenic IAS before episodes of SCA through explainability analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Recent studies revealed that Black American die from hypertension more than white Americans (Young, 2022). For Black Americans, the rate of deaths is more than double at 54.1 deaths per 100,000 men and 37.8 deaths per 100,000 women (Young, 2022). Greater expectation of care was associated with adherence to medication, and greater social support was also associated with adherence to medication (Grant, Seixas & Frederickson, 2016).  When hypertension is well-treated and well controlled, it can prevent cardiovascular events than management of other modifiable risk factors (Young, 2022). Expectation of care and social support are important factors for developing interventions to increase medication adherence among black Americans (Grant et al., 2016).

Alternate Hypothesis: There is no difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans?
Methodology:
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants' demographics and T-Test will be used to determine the difference between Black Americans and White Americans and antihypertensive drugs.
The researcher planned to access data on ethnic groups diagnosed with hypertension and the usage of antihypertensive drugs. Numerous studies have indicated that black Americans die from hypertension more than white Americans and are diagnosed with the condition more than other races. The Researcher planned to investigate barriers that prevented blacks from using antihypertensive drugs.","Anticipated Findings
If blacks have knowledge about hypertension (knowing the appropriate blood pressure parameters, disease duration, and modifiable factors required for hypertension control) they may adhere to antihypertensive medications with the support system. Finding barriers that contribute to nonadherence to antihypertensive medications may help clinicians to adopt strategies to improve patients' care and well-being. Due to the racial disparities in healthcare and utilization of insurance, the researcher anticipates that Black Americans will not adhere to antihypertensive medications. The social determinants of health can also play a significant role and this can have a major impact on participant’s health, well-being, and quality of life.

Research Questions: What are the demographic features of individuals with elevated total homocysteine levels (tHcy)? What medical co-morbidities are associated with elevated tHcy? Are there genetic variants in the genes of homocysteine metabolism that play a role in plasma hyperhomocysteinemia?
Elevated tHcy is a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, thromboembolism, and neuropsychological symptoms. It can be caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, renal insufficiency, or rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMS). Rare IEMs involving homocysteine metabolism can remain undiagnosed due to limitations in newborn screenings, variable clinical presentations, and overall lack of awareness. This study will identify clinical characteristics of individuals with elevated l tHcy, and identify genetic variants in homocysteine metabolism. This can improve medical care.","Project Purpose(s)

In order to address these research questions, we will build two cohorts – one of individuals with elevated tHcy levels (defined as greater than 30 micromole per liter), and one of individuals with normal tHcy levels (defined as less than 15 micromole per liter). The dataset will include demographic information, dietary information, medical history, imaging data, surgical history, lab values, and DNA sequence data for each participant. The dataset will first be analyzed in R using linear and logistic regression analysis to determine if there is an association between these clinical variables and tHcy, which will serve as the predictor variable. If the cohort for individuals with elevated homocysteine is robust, we will proceed to conduct genetic variant analysis. This will be done using Python and assistance from the Research Hub.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that the prevalence of medical co-morbidities will increase with increasing homocysteine levels and that lab values will be more clinically severe with increasing homocysteine levels. These findings will help characterize the clinical presentation of individuals with elevated tHcy levels. Having a better understanding of the population-level characteristics of those with elevated tHcy will help raise awareness of and increase education on the clinical features and outcomes associated with varying levels of tHcy. This, in turn, could help improve detection and diagnosis of elevated tHcy and its underlying causes, thus promoting better prevention and treatment management for the associated clinical outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Neither genomics or environmental factors alone are sufficient for complete understanding of complex diseases, or adequately address health conditions or inequalities in health. All of Us with rich and high-quality data on genomics and environmental exposures provide opportunities to understand the interactions between genes and environment on health. Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.  Song and Zhang (2014) developed tree-based analysis of rare variants (TARV) to construct super-variants which combine genetic markers in any loci. With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find novel gene-environment interactions for complex diseases, and some examples of their implications/contributions include:
• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations. Using the measures of discrimination and/or racism in All of US, we can assess not only how the race may affect genetic-health associations, but also the role of racism, and broadly, the culture and social environments.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Recent studies revealed that Black American die from hypertension more than white Americans (Young, 2022). For Black Americans, the rate of deaths is more than double at 54.1 deaths per 100,000 men and 37.8 deaths per 100,000 women (Young, 2022). Greater expectation of care was associated with adherence to medication, and greater social support was also associated with adherence to medication (Grant, Seixas & Frederickson, 2016).  When hypertension is well-treated and well controlled, it can prevent cardiovascular events than management of other modifiable risk factors (Young, 2022). Expectation of care and social support are important factors for developing interventions to increase medication adherence among black Americans (Grant et al., 2016).

Research Question: Is there a difference in antihypertensive drug usage among Black Americans and White Americans in the United States?
Null Hypothesis: There is a difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans in the United States?
Alternate Hypothesis: There is no difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans?
Methodology:
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants' demographics and T-Test will be used to determine the difference between Black Americans and White Americans and antihypertensive drugs.
The researcher planned to access data on ethnic groups diagnosed with hypertension and the usage of antihypertensive drugs. Numerous studies have indicated that black Americans die from hypertension more than white Americans and are diagnosed with the condition more than other races. The Researcher planned to investigate barriers that prevented blacks from using antihypertensive drugs.","Anticipated Findings
If blacks have knowledge about hypertension (knowing the appropriate blood pressure parameters, disease duration, and modifiable factors required for hypertension control) they may adhere to antihypertensive medications with the support system. Finding barriers that contribute to nonadherence to antihypertensive medications may help clinicians to adopt strategies to improve patients' care and well-being. Due to the racial disparities in healthcare and utilization of insurance, the researcher anticipates that Black Americans will not adhere to antihypertensive medications. The social determinants of health can also play a significant role and this can have a major impact on participant’s health, well-being, and quality of life. Examples of SDOH include safe housing, transportation, neighbors, racism, discrimination, violence, education, job opportunities, income, literacy skills, and so forth.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Understand and address health disparities between Hispanics living in Puerto Rico and those living on the mainland USA, explicitly examining the differences in chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Additionally, how sociodemographic factors, such as employment, income, and education, influence mental health, quality of life, and overall health. This is essential for crafting targeted interventions and policies to enhance the health outcomes of Hispanics. Socioeconomic disparities contribute to unequal healthcare access, variations in health behaviors and healthcare outcomes. Investigating these relationships yields evidence-based insights to inform public health strategies, and health policy development to mitigate health disparities.
These insights can guide future research, healthcare initiatives, and interventions, and enhance the health and well-being of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic populations across the United States.","Project Purpose(s)

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. As accessibility to molecular testing increases, genetic arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy conditions are increasingly diagnosed within families. Data on how individuals with genetic cardiac conditions fare during pregnancy is limited. We seek to address the following aims in order to improve prenatal counseling and pregnancy care of this group of patients.
1) In those individuals that develop peripartum cardiomyopathy, what proportion have a genetic predisposition for developing cardiac dysfunction.
2) How do pregnancy outcomes of individuals with genetic cardiomyopathy syndromes compare to the general population
3) How do pregnancy outcomes of individuals with genetic arrhythmia syndromes compare to the general population
4) How does pregnancy impact long term health of individuals with genetic cardiac conditions","Project Purpose(s)

Our cohort will involve all individuals of female sex over the age of 18. We will develop different subgroups within this cohort to address each of our aims including a subgroup of patients who experienced peripartum cardiomyopathy, a subgroup of those who have a genetic cardiomyopathy syndrome and a subgroup of individuals with a genetic arrhythmia syndrome. We will utilize univariate and bivariate statistical analysis to compare maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that some proportion of individuals that develop peripartum cardiomyopathy have a heritable cardiomyopathy condition that is unmasked during pregnancy due to physiologic changes. If confirmed, this can inform guidance and recommendations on testing and caring for this set of patients after pregnancy. In addition, describing contemporary pregnancy outcomes of individuals with genetic cardiac conditions can illustrate barriers and potential areas of improvement in caring for this set of patients.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease. Thus, the purpose of this workspace is  to develop internal methods for examining the association between polygenic risk scores of unique intermediate phenotypes derived in diverse  population based cohorts, and overt cardiometabolic disease within All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will leverage whole genome sequencing data from multiple, diverse, population based cohorts to derive polygenic risk scores for a variety of novel phenotypes using multiple methods such as: clumping/pruning and thresholding (PRSice), LDpred2, and PRS-CS. Validated scores will then be constructed for each All of Us participant and the association between polygenic risk and cardiometabolic diseases will be examined.","Anticipated Findings
The current workbench serves as a first step toward identifying novel pathways linking intermediate phenotypes available in our diverse population based cohorts to cardiometabolic disease risk in All of Us. Furthermore, there is considerable interest in developing and validating polygenic risk scores in diverse populations to shrink gaps in clinical care across ethnic and socioeconomic groups. We aim to work toward precision medicine that is applicable to all populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Arab-Americans experience similar barriers in healthcare access as other ethnic minorities in the US, and tend to have worse health outcomes than caucasian patients. Moreover, Arab-Americans tend to experience a higher burden of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, unlike other minorities, Arab-Americans are classified as ""White"" on US census data as well as in most nationally representative health databases.
Given the unique challenges faced by Arab-Americans, this misguided data aggregation represents a costly missed opportunity to elucidate insights about the health status of Arab-Americans.
We intend to study the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases amongst Middle Eastern and North African identifying individuals, and contrast that with non-hispanic caucasian individuals, in order to elucidate differences in health status and ultimately demonstrate the importance of deaggregating MENA demographics data within healthcare system and databases.","Project Purpose(s)

we will use epidemiological tools to assess whether there is a meaningful difference between MENA-Americans and non-hispanic white individuals in terms of baseline health status, burden of disease, access to healthcare, and health outcomes.

We except to find a higher burden of disease amongst MENA-identifying individuals compare to non-hispanic white individuals, worse access to healthcare, and worse health outcomes. There is plenty of evidence within the MENA community about these disparities, yet the lack of a ""MENA"" demographic category has prevented these disparities from being validated through large, nationally representative databases. The ""All of Us"" database provides a unique opportunity for the MENA-identifying community to validate the challenges and struggles they have experienced for decades.
