The primary objective is to determine how statin effectiveness is modified by CHD polygenic risk score in a real-world cohort of primary prevention participants.
We will investigate coronary heart disease polygenic risk scores for statin effectiveness of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in stratified race/ethnicity and age groups so that we can  (1) study this relationship in subsets of the population that are traditionally excluded from statin randomized controlled trials and (2) determine the impact of social determinants of health which vary across these stratified groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Health record data, lab results, prescription dispensing record would be used to define phenotype. Different statistical methods (like logistic regression, survival analysis etc.) would be used to analyze the data.
We shall calculate CHD polygenic risk scores of participants in the cohort using genotype data. Covariate-adjusted Cox regression models will be used to compare the risk of cardiovascular outcomes between statin users and matched nonusers.
We are mainly going to use R for the analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that for primary prevention patients undergoing routine care, CHD polygenic risk modifies statin relative risk reduction of incident myocardial infarction independent of statin LDL-C lowering. Our findings will replicate our prior work which identified a subset of patients with attenuated clinical benefit from statins.","Demographic Categories of Interest

To evaluate the association between serum ferritin and coronary heart disease. There is currently no consensus in the literature on the effect of elevated blood ferritin on cardiovascular disease outcomes.

In addition to the demographic variables of the study participants, we will divide the serum ferritin variable values into quartiles and use that as a predictor variable of coronary heart disease among the study participants. Some studies have hinted that the rate of  iron metabolism varies by race/ethinicity. Therefore, we will look at the association stratified by race/ethinicity. Both binary and multivariable logistic regression models will be used for this analysis, which will be done on this platform using the R programming language.","Anticipated Findings

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between dental infections (as consequence of dental caries and pulp necrosis) and additional diseases (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) although limitations of such studies hamper conclusive interpretations . We showed that apical periodontitis (pulp necrosis with bone resorption) was strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease; further, we identified an association between an established hypertension-associated gene with apical periodontitis in a well-characterized population. These findings strongly indicate that a shared genetic etiology could contribute to oral health-systemic health relationships. By using All of Us data, we hope to validate our previous findings and expand knowledge of the etiology linking oral health and systemic health. We will identify additional factors (social determinants of health) that may play a role in the interconnectedness between oral health and general health.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Set of conditions - dental infections, diabetes and cardiovascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Data available via All of Us research workbench shows 20 dental infection conditions that reflect a continuum of dental infection (i.e., dental caries, pulpal and periapical conditions) of interest. We are interested to investigate if relationships exist between these dental infection conditions with type 2 diabetes, hypertensive disorder, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart murmur and cerebrovascular accident.
We will access demographic, clinical (dental and medical) and genetic data from individuals with the above conditions (no exclusions based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or genetic ancestry). We will test for association between a set of conditions, and will also identify potential genes/variants associated with a combined phenotype of dental infection + systemic condition using a variety of tools and statistical methods. All of Us data will allow us to identify a large sample of unrelated controls to increase confidence in the results.","Anticipated Findings
Much of the controversial findings in epidemiological and genetic association studies looking at oral/dental and systemic conditions is due to differences in populations studied, data ascertainment methodologies, but mainly due to limited sample sizes. This study will leverage high-quality demographic/clinical and genomic data of a large and diverse dataset that will allow the best (largest) evidence to date. It will also enable a robust model for use in future studies by other investigators.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to examine hypertension disparities in sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults compared to non-SGM adults. Our primary aim is to examine differences in the prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated hypertension between SGM and non-SGM adults. We will examine the differences in the prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated hypertension by race, ethnicity, education, income, and geographic location. SGM adults are known to have a higher prevalence of hypertension; however, prompt diagnosis of hypertension and patient insight into hypertension are critical for treatment initiation, maintenance, and reduction of long-term negative outcomes. Since SGM adults report lower access to healthcare, we hypothesize the prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated hypertension will be higher in SGM adults compared to non-SGM adults.

We will use the genetics and associated information in the All of Us research dataset to analyze genetic contributions to bipolar disorder, its comorbidities and treatment response, in racial and ethnic minority populations. Specific questions we will ask are:

2. Are genetic associations between biopolar disorder and cardiovascular disease (or metabolic syndrome) observed in white, Black, and Latino populations?
3. Are there unique genetic polymorphisms in Black populations associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder treatment?
We hypothesize that genetic associations with bipolar disorder in racial and ethnic minority populations will partially overlap with genetic variation previously identified in white populations, but that there will be unique population-specific variation as well, particularly for lithium response.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Bipolar Disorder)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use PLINK and/or other GWAS tools within the All of Us Research Workbench on whole genome sequence data. The population with bipolar disorder or manic episodes without a bipolar disorder diagnosis will be defined by ICD-10-CM codes of F31.x and/or F30.x respectively. Racial and gender self-identification will be used as primary covariates with other demographic variables (e.g., age) considered as confounding variables. Ancestry informative markers and whole genome PCA will be used to control for genetic ancestry and population substructure. We will also consider BMI and other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol diabetes). Lastly we will examine therapeutic doses of lithium and lithium response (where possible). Limitations include lack of specificity in diagnosis and/or presentation and incomplete or unclear data on efficacy of specific pharmaceutical therapy.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate confirming that genetic variation associated with bipolar disorder in white populations is similar, though not necessarily identical, in racial and ethnic minority populations. We also anticipate identifying genetic factors unique to these populations, particularly associated with lithium response. Trans-ethnic studies are important, even as validation studies, because they extend our understanding of disease to populations that have been traditionally underserved in medicine. Further, these studies will elucidate differences in response to lithium that have hindered proper access to treatment.
Because the intersection of mental health, genetics, and racial disparities can be stigmatizing, we surveyed the patient community and developed a community advisory board (CAB) of stakeholders (including patients) focused on bipolar disorder and genomics for regular feedback.

Individuals with complex diseases can have different mutations within a single gene or set of interacting genes, which predispose them to the same disease. To address this issue, we are developing a new statistical method that produces ""epistatic scores"" — summarizing how strongly genes and pathways interact and drive the broad-sense heritability of a phenotype or trait of interest. Our research will test several control condition phenotypes for traits that are supposed to be more heritable and less susceptible to environmental influences, to include less complex and more visible phenotypes such as height, as well as health-based phenotypes such as cardiovascular risk. Recent studies designed to estimate the effects of interactions on complex phenotypes have demonstrated that genetic and environmental factors both contribute significant marginal effects; however, the interaction between them has been consistently deemed non-significant to the broad-sense heritability of these traits.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The main statistical framework we will use is the ""MArginal ePIstasis Test"" or MAPIT (Crawford et al. 2017, PLoS Genet), a linear mixed modeling strategy for detecting genetic variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) involved in statistical epistasis in genetic mapping studies. In the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MAPIT estimates and tests the marginal epistatic effect or the combined epistatic effect between SNPs of interest and all other SNPs in the data. We propose to apply our method to multiple traits assayed in the AllofUs dataset, including Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Type 2 Diabetes, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Standing Height, and Body-Mass Index. Our research will yield new insight into the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying these traits.","Anticipated Findings
We aim to interrogate whether interactive effects between genes and different environments contribute to explanations of complex behavioral traits. For example, we can interrogate the interaction between genes that may contribute to the risk of depression and environmental modifiers. By extending the MAPIT framework, we will characterize the risk and measure how environmental and structural features (e.g., socioeconomic status, neighborhood, etc.) serve as statistical covariates. With regard to public health relevance, these novel sets of associations and actionable variables can influence how illnesses are diagnosed and treated. Statistics historically underrepresented the impact of environmental conditions on genetic outcomes; therefore, we aim to provide a more appropriate statistical test for interrogating gene-by-environment effects within and between populations regarding their impact on complex behavioral phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)

In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients.

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures.

1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one the leading causes of death in the world and rates can differ by ethnicity and race due to both genetics and environment. Cardiometabolic phenotypes such as lipid levels, blood pressure, BMI, and blood glucose levels are established CVD risk factors and are used clinically to define pre- and overt disease. Understanding the genetic architecture of these phenotypes within and between ethnic groups will provide a better understanding how genetic differences might shape differential CVD disease risk and prevalence.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Investigate the genetic architecture of cardiometabolic phenotypes contributing to CVD risk within and between ethnicities.
  
)","Scientific Approaches
We will use mixed model methods to estimate genetic heritability and genetic correlations of the cardiometabolic phenotypes and to perform genome-wide association. The models will include a genetic relationship matrix constructed using the chip data. Covariate adjustments will include age, sex, demographics, principal components, and others as identified as correlated with the phenotype. The model will include heterogenous error variances by ethnicity to account for differences in phenotype distributions.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the genetic architecture of cardiometabolic traits such as lipids, BMI, and blood pressure within and between ethnicities as measured by heritability, genetic correlation and genetic association will differ. The differences may provide a broader understanding of how these traits together with other non-genetic factors might contribute to differences in CVD disease risk and prevalence.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for nearly 30% of postpartum maternal deaths (PMDs) and 81% of CVD-related deaths occurred in postpartum. CVD-related PMDs are often associated with missed or delayed diagnoses, and most could be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. However, existing CVD risk assessment models such as Modified WHO classification, CARPREG II, and California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) algorithm are lack of sufficient ability to accurately predict postpartum CVD since (i) most postpartum CVD cases had no prior diagnosis of CVD, (ii) many symptoms of CVD overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms, and (iii) only a few risk factors were included in the models. Most importantly, no existing model has accounted for the complicated temporal dynamics during the pregnancy, which could serve as invaluable evidence for predicting the postpartum disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular system disease, long COVID, maternal health, etc.)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will (1) characterize the risk factors accounting for temporal variants for postpartum CVD using unsupervised ML techniques. Our working hypothesis is that account for temporal relationship will provide a novel and more comprehensive group of risk factors for postpartum CVD; (2) Develop predictive models for postpartum CVD using supervised ML algorithms and regressions. Our working hypothesis is that the novel ML models accounting for temporal dynamics will achieve better performance compared to the existing models; and (3) Assess the potential to reduce healthcare costs by the prevention and early diagnosis of CVD. Out working hypothesis is that the failure to predict postpartum CVD generates excessive and unnecessary health care cost.","Anticipated Findings
As the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified a comprehensive group of timely risk factor for postpartum CVD and developed a group of ML models that are able to forecast the onset of postpartum CVD. We also expect to have evaluated the potential healthcare savings brought by these predictive models. These results are expected to have and important positive impact because they will provide a strong and data-driven knowledge framework for further development and future clinical decision supporting system, ultimately providing new opportunities for the development of novel therapies to prevent and treat postpartum CVD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes remains an overwhelming public health burden in the United States with the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes reaching an estimated 8.7% of the adult population in 2019. Among patient with DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Importantly, the burden of disease is not shared equally across the population; racial and socioeconomic disparities are evident in recent DM data.
The goal of this project is to use the All of Us Research Program database to explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in composite CVD risk factor control amongDM patients with and without CVD. We want to know 1. Among patients with diabetes mellitus with and without CVD, what is the extent of composite risk factor control (BP, HbA1c, LDL-C, BMI, tobacco status, activity level? 2. How is race, ethnicity, sex, income, and healthcare access associated with number of risk factors at target for control?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Demographic data will be compared in patients with and without CVD using a survey t test for continuous variables or Chi-squared test for categorial variables. We will use a chi-squared test of proportions to compare the proportion of patients at target individual and composite risk factor control between patients with and without CVD. Multiple logistic regression will be used to identify if race, sex, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare are associated with individual and composite risk factor control.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that there are different patterns in terms of risk factor control across DM patients with and without CVD depending on social determinants of health, which will help to identify the possible prevention strategies for DM and CVD and address social determinants to improve health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by lifelong elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and dramatically increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genetic studies now suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) encompasses five discrete subtypes based on LDL-c levels, 1) a monogenic FH variant, 2) a high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) polygenic score, 3) elevated lipoprotein(a), 4) elevated LDL-c polygenic score with elevated lipoprotein(a), and 5) a positive family history without an identifiable genetic cause, or true “phenotypic FH.” The primary question of this project is: Are there differences in treatment, comorbidities, and ASCVD outcomes between FH subtypes?","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to screen all individuals with whole genome sequences available for monogenic variants in an FH gene.

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. Why is the maternal mortality rate in the United States so high when compared to the rest of the developed world?
2. Why is the maternal mortality rate in the United States rising despite technological advancements?
3. What is creating the cardiovascular health differences between Black and white mothers that have traditionally been attributed to causing the maternal mortality racial disparity?
4. Are there genetic differences between races that causes a high maternal mortality rate in one but not another? What else could cause this difference?
5. What could be other causes of the racial disparity in maternal mortality aside from cardiovascular health differences? Do implicit bias, structural racism, or cultural differences play a role?
6. What can be done to remedy this disparity in maternal health outcomes, both for cardiovascular health differences and for any alternative explanations? Should we target improvements by the patient, the provider, or the entire healthcare system?","Project Purpose(s)

)","Scientific Approaches
The primary scientific approach of this work space is analyzing the data in the All of Us Database regarding maternal mortality, cardiovascular health, cardiovascular risk factors, and social determinants of health. We will be looking at the differences in maternal health outcomes between Black and white populations in the database, as they relate to differences in these cardiovascular and social metrics, along with genetic data. The primary statistical analysis will be T-tests that evaluate the impact of genetic influences on differences in maternal mortality, along with information about how the socioeconomic status of individuals can predispose them to a high mortality rate.","Anticipated Findings
Currently, much of the data collected suggest one reason for the high maternal mortality rate in African American women in the United States; cardiovascular-related complications. We hope to find potential alternative conclusions that suggest other causes for the high maternal mortality rate in African American women. We also anticipate demonstrating the fallacies in the current race-based  view of cardiovascular health differences and elucidate possible social determinants of cardiovascular health that are, in turn, affecting maternal mortality rates. The workspace will analyze all aspects that create a poor healthcare system, the long-term effects of systemic racism, and a cycle of neglect towards this population. The findings from the analysis will contribute in creating awareness of the true factors which contribute to maternal mortality, and how to identify and prevent such factors effectively.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Age related hearing loss, or presbycusis, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, with hypertension as a predictor of faster rates of hearing decline10. Impairments in cochlear microcirculation and perfusion have been identified in patients with presbycusis. RAS targeted treatments have the potential for system-wide vasoprotective effects with the potential to protect microcirculation within the inner ear and thus preserve hearing in such clinical conditions with significant vasculopathic contributions. We propose to query population databases to identify previously unexplored associations of RAS blockade and hearing loss.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Profound sensorineural hearing loss)","Scientific Approaches
This experiment will leverage the considerable power of population databases to identify previously unexplored associations between anti-hypertensive treatment with RAS inhibitors and surrogate measures of hearing decline, including hearing aid use, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, and progression to cochlear implantation. These retrospective epidemiological experiments will test the specific hypothesis that among patients who are treated for hypertension, those who are prescribed ACEis or ARBs will have a lower frequency of diagnostic codes for hearing loss (e.g. ICD 9 code 389.1 and 389.2) and of cochlear implantation (e.g. ICD 9 codes 20.96 to 20.98) than those patients on other antihypertensive treatments (e.g. diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers). We will test this aim via a database review of the All of Us database.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that findings from these studies may greatly aid in the translation of these therapies into the clinical realm. We have developed the general hypothesis that inhibition of angiotensin II signaling in populations at risk for hearing loss will be associated with lower frequency of hearing loss and subsequent cochlear implantation.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Persons with bipolar disorder (BD) are at significantly increased risk of excess medical morbidity and early mortality.  To our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive descriptive epidemiologic paper of physical conditions in BD, the way there are descriptive epidemiologic papers of psychiatric comorbidity in BD.  The majority of research has focused on a particular physical system (e.g., cardiovascular), combined mood disorders or exclude BD entirely, or do not address comorbidity and disparities amongst conditions.  Most of the US national surveys with superb psychiatric phenotyping are aging.  Correspondingly, there has been a shift from survey research to secondary analyses of electronic health records, registries, and biobanks.  We will comprehensively describe burden, correlates and disparities, and multimorbidity of physical conditions amongst persons with BD in All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (bipolar disorder)","Scientific Approaches
In an effort to assess the utility and important differences in the shift from representative surveys to large-scale clinical registries, we will be conduct descriptive analyses of physical conditions in persons with BD in All of Us. Such analyses include calculating means and proportions of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and comorbidity assessed by calculating odds ratios between BD and physical conditions, as well as across sociodemographic strata.  We may further enrich our understanding of these associations by estimating population-attributable risk proportions and examining tetrachoric correlations.","Anticipated Findings
Comorbidity may be more common in clinical samples than representative epidemiologic surveys, although occasionally clinical biobanks have more healthy participants than observed in broader clinical datasets.  Additionally, the All of Us is contemporary whereas US nationally representative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys (e.g., the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication) are approximately 2 decades old.  For these reasons, we expect to observe differences in comorbidity between BD and physical conditions when comparing All of Us to prior surveys.  We expect to observe salient disparities that may suggest important follow-up research questions as well as potential opportunities to improve care/service.  This will be a contemporary resource on burden, correlates, and disparities in BD comorbidity that can inform future studies, and lend insight into the potential modernization of psychiatric epidemiology data.","Demographic Categories of Interest

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable cause of premature mortality globally.  Elevated BP, with an estimated 30-50% heritability, is considered a precursor phenotype for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, including heart failure (HF), stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD). A genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) integrates the cumulative effects of common genetic variants across the genome and provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic risk of CV diseases.
This study aims to pursue an investigation of a genome-wide BP PRS constructed in a multi-ethnic cohort to examine: 1) the association of BP PRS with BP traits (SBP, DBP, MAP, PP, and HTN); 2) the association of BP PRS with CVD events; 3) the association of traditional CV risk factor profiles with CVD events stratified by BP PRS categories, and 4) the incremental contribution of BP PRS to CVD risk prediction using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohorts Equation (PCE).","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the pan-ancestry UK Biobank GWAS as our base data to derive BP PRSs using the clumping-and-thresholding (C+T) method (which combines SNPs at different P-value and LD thresholds) and the PRS-CS method (which fits a continuous shrinkage [CS] prior to account for diverse genetic architectures).  We will then test the association of the BP PRS with BP traits in the multi-ethnic NHLBI TOPMed cohort populations. We will also validate our findings of the association of BP PRS with BP traits in the multi-ethnic All of Us research dataset.","Anticipated Findings
This study will establish if a multi-ethnic BP PRS is assocaited with BP traits and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. The findings of this observational study may indicate that the increased genetic risk for BP and adverse CV events (captured by the BP PRS) may be mitigated by rigorous control of the modifiable traditional CV risk factors, a premise that warrants further investigation.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population.

Gout is an inflammatory metabolic disease affecting > 4% of US adults, including > 9% of those over age 65.  People with gout can experience very painful and disabling attacks (flares) in their joints and are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.
Gout results from high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricaemia) and studies by our group and others have identified many environmental, clinical, and genetic factors associated with gout. These include diuretic medications (increased risk), and coffee and vitamin C (decreased risk).  However, despite evidence that gout is having a greater impact on men and women in non-White racial groups in the US, most factors were identified in people of self-reported White race.
To address these gaps, we are exploring the AllofUs data to plan future studies on the environmental, genetic, and clinical factors associated with gout (or worse gout outcomes) in women and men of different racial/ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate using the EHR data and self-reported survey data to classify participants’ gout status and uric acid levels.  The EHR, survey, and physical measurements and Fitbit data will be used to classify clinical and environmental factors potentially impacting gout, as well as gout-related chronic conditions.
We anticipate using logistic regression models to evaluate the association between exposures and the risk of gout or hyperuricemia, adjusting for well-established gout risk factors such as overweight/obesity and use of diuretic medications.  We will also assess for joint effects and interactions between exposures, including genetic exposures drawn from the Genomics dataset.  For example, our prior analysis of a different cohort of mainly White adults found that excess BMI can exacerbate the impact of carrying certain hyperuricemia genes on the risk of gout.  Mediation analysis will be performed to quantify factors influencing sex- or racial differences in the burden of gout.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are expected to enhance our understanding of the risk factors and burden of gout, especially in understudied sociodemographic groups who are particularly impacted by this chronic and disabling disease.

We aim to characterize a spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 genetic variants. More than a decade after the discovery of the trypanolytic missense variants in APOL1, it is now known that APOL1 high-risk variants are relatively common in individuals with sub-Saharan ancestry and are associated with higher risk of progressive chronic kidney disease. Although associations with cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, and preeclampsia have been reported, these associations warrant replication. Considering the expression of APOL1 in a wide range of cell types and that it is found as both a circulating and intracellular protein, it is likely that other diseases may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants and that these associations may be missed due to study design and statistical power. We plan to conduct a phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) using All of Us datasets to shed light to possible undetected diseases and phenotypes that may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Since APOL1 is exclusively found in individuals with sub-Saharan African ancestry, we plan to create a cohort of individuals who self-identify as Black (including Hispanic, African, African American, and Caribbean individuals and assess corresponding genomics data (for APOL1 genotyping), electronic health record (EHR) data of AoU datasets including diagnosis (ICD) and baseline demographics and measurements (BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, clinical chemistry data, and hormone levels). We will classify individuals into three groups based on the number of risk alleles carried: 0 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G0 genotype), 1 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G1, G0/G2), and 2 APOL1 risk alleles (G1/G1, G1/G2, G2/G2). Then, we will conduct a phenome-wide association study, to define the spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 high-risk variants using PheWAS R package.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases, creatinine and albuminuria measurements will show association with APOL1 high-risk genotypes that are consistent with previous reports, but given the size of the All-of-Us cohort, should narrow the confidence interval giving a more precise odds-ratio and a relative risk. Similarly, we can confirm (or not) the previously reported associations of sepsis, preeclampsia, and cardiovascular diseases with APOL1 high-risk genotypes, which would bring additional evidence that the association between these conditions and APOL1 high-risk genotypes. If novel phenotypes are found to be associated with APOL1 high-risk variant this will open new areas for investigation of APOL1-associated phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Although socio-economic factors, such as suitable access to health care, may play a role in the differences of the disease risks across diverse populations, a better understanding of the genetic determinants influencing cardiovascular risk factors and the chronic kidney disease risk in Hispanic or Latino individuals will allow for personalized medical treatments, contributing to mitigate the health disparities.

Statins are a cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States. Despite the conclusive evidence to the reduction of mortality among ASCVD patients, adherence patterns to this treatment remain alarmingly low with rates of discontinuity approaching 50% in the US population. Current research investigating this pattern have elucidated the impact of clinic-specific factors and patient-physician interactions, but these studies have been limited in generalizability as a result of operating in isolated health care systems. I seek to implement novel computational techniques to analyze patient record data en masse and to uncover the epidemiology of treatment adherence and to address unmet clinical needs of particularly vulnerable patient populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze electronic health records in the aggregate. This will allow the identification of patterns of treatment adherence for statin medication across the population.","Anticipated Findings
Previous research has suggested that patient adherence is multilayer, affected by factors like differences in clinical systems, patient-physician interaction, and systemic inequality. However, the difficulty of parsing through unstructured clinical notes has reduced many study designs to look at single health care systems and introduce significant bias in the findings. This has limited a robust understanding of the epidemiology of statin use and have likely contributed to unmet clinical needs of patients particularly from high-risk and vulnerable communities. My work will fill gaps in the understanding of statin adherence to inform future policy changes and promote better access to care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose of this research is to establish whether it is feasible to study the pharmacogenomic determinants of antiplatelet therapy response in the AllofUs Program. We would like to estimate the number of participants who have been prescribed various antiplatelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel, ticagrelor, etc.) as well as the subset of individuals who have experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event during therapy. If feasible, ultimately we would like to identify genetic variants that impact the rates of on-treatment cardiovascular events.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We would like to define cohorts based on antiplatelet medication usage and relevant cardiovascular events using the Cohort Builder and Dataset Builder. Specifically, we will query the number of patients who have been prescribed antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, aspirin, etc. Furthermore, we would like to ascertain the number of patients who have experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event while on therapy. Assuming the sample size seems adequate, power analyses may be performed to determine if genetic analyses are warranted. If it is deemed feasible, a robust analytical strategy will be developed to test for association between genetic markers and related clinical phenotypes in patients who have been prescribed antiplatelet therapy.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the AllofUs dataset will contain an adequate number of data points to assess the association between genetic variants and cardiovascular endpoints in those prescribed antiplatelet therapy...at least for those medications that are more commonly prescribed. Assuming the dataset is sufficiently powered, we anticipate that we would be to identify genetic variation that influences antiplatelet therapy response.
Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Antiplatelet therapy is routinely used to reduce the rates of recurrent cardiovascular events in those who have suffered an initial event. Understanding the factors that influence response to treatment not only allows us to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of variable antiplatelet response but may also lead to more personalized strategies to reduce adverse clinical outcomes in those who are prescribed these medications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by lifelong elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and dramatically increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genetic studies now suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) encompasses five discrete subtypes based on LDL-c levels, 1) a monogenic FH variant, 2) a high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) polygenic score, 3) elevated lipoprotein(a), 4) elevated LDL-c polygenic score with elevated lipoprotein(a), and 5) a positive family history without an identifiable genetic cause, or true “phenotypic FH.” The primary question of this project is: Are there differences in treatment, comorbidities, and ASCVD outcomes between FH subtypes?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (familial hypercholesterolemia)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to screen all individuals with whole genome sequences available for monogenic variants in an FH gene. We will calculate an LDL cholesterol polygenic risk score from each participant’s whole genome sequence. Using labs and measurements, we will identify individuals with an FH subtype. Additionally, we will stratify the cohort into statin treated and untreated individuals using medication data. Finally, we will use EH data to determine comorbidities and ASCVD outcomes. We will primarily use regression analyses to compare ASCVD risk in those with each FH subtype to individuals without FH.","Anticipated Findings
We expect ASCVD risk to vary among FH subtypes and to be more pronounced in each of the subtypes, relative to those without FH. We also anticipate ASCVD risk and comorbidities to vary between individuals using lipid-lowering medication and those not using medication. Our findings may demonstrate the importance of considering subtypes in ASCVD risk assessment for patients with the FH phenotype.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (substance use disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will examine the relationship between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and CRP by regressing CRP on the cannabis use measures in the All of Us dataset. All models will control for covariates including age, sex, race and BMI. We may construct additional models that covary for comorbid conditions such as depression or asthma. Additionally, we will examine demographic counts for the variables of interest in our study.","Anticipated Findings
We would anticipate to find an association between cannabis use and CRP levels, with cannabis use in the last three months being associated with lower CRP levels. On the other hand, we would expect to find that cannabis use disorder (or some other measure of heavy use) is associated with higher CRP levels. This project could help untangle how the relationship between cannabis use and CRP changes according to level of cannabis use. It may also give insight into whether this relationship is confounded by other conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population. Mounting evidence indicates that this impact disproportionately affects minority populations. Most factors underlying these health disparities pertain to the social determinants of health, but it is unclear how biological factors play a role or interact with these social determinants. The main questions of this study are: (1) can we use All of US to identify novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are specific to a given minority group? (2) Are existing risk factors for CVD shared across all minority groups? (3) Can we disentangle the contributions of social determinants of health and biological factors contributing to cardiovascular disease?

We will use linear and logistic regression to test for association between risk factors, social determinants of health, genomic risk scores, and the conditions of interest, and product terms to test for effect modification between contributor variables.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that: (1) a substantial number of the known vascular risk factors increase risk of cardiovascular disease across all evaluated groups; (2) both social determinants of health and polygenic susceptibility are independently associated with these cardiovascular conditions; and (3) there are interactions between the effect of social determinants of health and polygenic contribution to disease.

We have evidence to suggest that there is an association between inflammation and cardiovascular disease health. However, less is known about how social determinate of health, such as features of the built environment (e.g. neighborhood safety, urban vs. rural, etc.) are associated with cardiovascular health through inflammation. Moreover, it is unclear how these mechanistic pathways from social determinates of health, through inflammation, to cardiovascular disease risk vary by key sociodemographic features like race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. Thus, the following investigation 2 has research questions.
1.  Are environmental features (e.g. housing instability, neighborhood features, etc.)  associated with physiological deregulation as measured by inflammation (e.g. cytokines, Interleukin’s, and c-reactive protein, biological markers of inflammation) and thus cardiovascular disease risk?
2. Do these associations vary by race and/or sexual orientation?","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
For these analyses we will use the lab and survey data. We will specifically combine the data from 2017-2019 into one cross sectional dataset.  Next, we will select the relevant variables and conduct descriptive statistics.  For our formal analyses we will run structural equation models as well as a latent class analyses to better specify profiles of inflammation using cytokines, Interleukin’s, and c-reactive protein, and other biological markers of inflammation.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to;
a define meaningful profiles of inflammation;
b understand how social determinates of health are associated with cardiovascular disease through inflammation processes; and
c. understand how this process may vary by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and the intersection of them both.
We believe this is an important contribution to the field given the lack of mechanistic inquiries related to social determinates of health and cardiovascular disease risk particularly for sexual and racial minorities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction and stroke) are leading causes of death and morbidity in the U.S. Many epidemiological studies have found associations between environmental exposures (e.g., air pollutants, weather, and green space) and these health outcomes. However, our understanding is limited on the potential effects of short-term exposure to extreme temperature and its interaction with other environmental exposures and whether such effect varies across different age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status remains unclear.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow acquire somatic mutations that lead to overgrowth of a genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells.

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In order to understand the relationship of platelets and how abnormal counts can affect or lead to patients with diseases and disorders, we will be looking for relationships in various problems including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
Questions to be researched are as follows:
1. How do patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease compare to those without in the general population in relationship to platelet count?
2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mineral metabolism disturbances are ubiquitous in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with fracture risk, soft tissue and vascular calcification, and cardiovascular-related mortality. GWAS of circulating mineral metabolism markers among individuals of European ancestry have identified common variants associated with circulating PTH, calcium, phosphate and FGF23. The impact of  these variants among persons with CKD, who have the most pronounced disturbances in mineral metabolism, is unknown. Moreover, it is possible that genetic associations may differ according to racial background, given known racial-ethnic differences in PTH and vitamin D metabolism in patients with CKD.  Elucidating these associations specifically within a CKD population is important, not only because of the marked abnormalities in mineral metabolism and racial-ethnic differences, but also because these abnormalities are systematically evaluated and treated in clinical practice among persons with CKD.","Project Purpose(s)

1- Can we use All of Us data to calculate the cardiovascular pooled score? We want to use and utilize the unique data collected by the All of Us program including smoking information (status, age of starting smoking, age of quieting), underrepresented race data (African american, Asian, others, ..), and  measurements values such as blood pressure and cholesterol to calculate the score.
2- Can we identify the scores that we calculate within a year of All of Us enrollment? We wanted to know the participants who might have cardiovascular risk score within the time enrollment. This will help the program quantify the importance of collecting further longitudinal data for existing and future participants.
3- Will the risk score per race group be different? We compared the risk scores in each racial groups to quantify if some racial groups have higher or lower risk scores even if they have a cardiovascular disease in the future","Project Purpose(s)

In this project, we plan on using the AHA algorithm/equation to calculate the cardiovascular risk scores ( https://ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.0000437741.48606.98). Further, we want to demonstrate the usage of smoking and race data collected by the program, which are data that usually researchers use natural language processing to extract, to facilitate the calculation of cardiovascular risk score.
We will calculate the scores using 1- Data manipulation: Using python and BigQuery to: A- Retrieve medications (diabetes), lab measurements including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, race, and smoking information provided by participants  2- Visualization: A- Creating histogram for calculated scores using python visualization library Matplotlib","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity and importance of the data collected by the program and can be challenging to extract from medical records (smoking status) by showing by calculating the cardiovascular risk within 10 years. We expect to find: 1) the easiness in using data from different sources (EHR and survey data) to build a model or calculate a risk. 2) the heterogeneity in All of Us population where underrepresented population in clinical trials or clinical data set are more present in the All of Us  3) the cardiovascular risk score is different in racial groups.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern.

Genetic variation plays an important role in disease-related traits, such as body mass index (BMI), cholesterol levels, and other lab values associated with cardiovascular disease. One important way of identifying disease-relevant biology is by examining rare genetic variants resulting in the complete loss of function of a given gene. This occurs when an individual contains two copies of a damaging variant at the same genetic locus. These variants (called ""knockouts""), though rare, can result in extreme phenotypes that can reveal important disease mechanisms leading to novel treatment approaches. Sometimes, these variants can even result in lab values associated with lower disease risk, which provides an important clue for potential strategies to improve health. This study, building off preliminary data from the UK Biobank, will examine the association of genetic knockouts on disease-related traits.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This study will examine exome data to identify homozygous loss of function (and predicted damaging missense) variants. Carriers of homozygous variants will be compared to non-carriers on a variety of disease-related quantitative traits. Primary focus will be on cardiometabolic traits, such as BMI, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. Follow-up analyses will also include anthropometric traits. We will be especially sensitive to any population-specific variants, so as not to create stigmatizing effects of research. Additionally, because our focus is on rare variation, we will follow All of Us guidelines on reporting data with cell size between 1 and 20.","Anticipated Findings

Statins are a cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States. Despite the conclusive evidence to the reduction of mortality among ASCVD patients, adherence patterns to this treatment remain alarmingly low with rates of discontinuity approaching 50% in the US population. Current research investigating this pattern have elucidated the impact of clinic-specific factors and patient-physician interactions, but these studies have been limited in generalizability as a result of operating in isolated health care systems.  I seek to implement novel computational techniques to analyze patient record data en masse and to uncover the epidemiology of treatment adherence and to address unmet clinical needs of particularly vulnerable patient populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze  electronic health records in the aggregate. This will allow the identification of patterns of treatment adherence for statin medication across the population.","Anticipated Findings
Previous research has suggested that patient adherence is multilayer, affected by factors like differences in clinical systems, patient-physician interaction, and systemic inequality. However, the difficulty of parsing through unstructured clinical notes has reduced many study designs to look at single health care systems and introduce significant bias in the findings. This has limited a robust understanding of the epidemiology of statin use and have likely contributed to unmet clinical needs of patients particularly from high-risk and vulnerable communities. My work will fill gaps in the understanding of statin adherence to inform future policy changes and promote better access to care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It is well known that there is a strong association between Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). Although there are several CVD prediction scores available to predict the probability of CVD in the general population, none of them are accurate enough to estimate the extent of CVD risk in CKD patients. For example, the Framingham score has been questioned as it was created based on a homogenous, geographically restricted and predominantly white population. Additionally, there are other factors (non-traditional risk factors of CVD that are specific to CKD such as albuminuria, anemia, fluid overload etc.) which are not included in the Framingham score which may play an essential role in estimating ischemic heart disease in patients with CKD.  As a result, it may overestimate the risk and have poor discriminatory power in the CKD population. All these indicate the need for the development of more appropriate risk factors to assess the CVD risk among CKD patients.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (chronic kidney failure)","Scientific Approaches
•	A retrospective cohort study will be conducted to create a model capable of predicting CVD using traditional and non-traditional risk factors of CVD in patients with CKD. The study will include CVD patients with CKD: age 18-80, CKD stage 1-5(including patients on dialysis), in accordance with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI).
•	The baseline data collection will include but not limited to age, sex, CKD stage, CVD’s history, medications history as well as traditional CVD risk factors.
•	Baseline renal functions and other parameters related to CVD will be assessed and those include: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP).
•	To investigate the association between CVD in CKD patients and potential risk factors, Cox Proportional-Hazards model will be used for the statistical analysis.","Anticipated Findings
•	Creating a model using traditional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes at el) and non-traditional risk factors (albuminuria, anemia at el) can estimate the risk of CVD in patients with CKD.
