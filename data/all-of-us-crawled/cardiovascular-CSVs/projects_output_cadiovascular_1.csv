Many women experience a worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors (such as blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body fat quantity/localization) around midlife. The menopausal transition, and its associated hormonal changes, may contribute to some of this increased cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk. Each individual woman can react differently to menopause, and studies by SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) and others have shown that different women experience different trajectories of hormonal and cardiometabolic changes around the time of the final menstrual period.
I would like to identify genetic and other factors that are associated with cardiometabolic risk factor trajectories in midlife women. This could help to better understand how menopause impacts cardiometabolic health and could help to predict how individual women may respond to menopause and perhaps help to tailor lifestyle interventions, treatments, etc. to each woman (precision medicine).","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Disease and Menopause)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The first step will be to extract the timing of the final menstrual period (FMP) from the dataset, if available, for each woman participant. If that is successful, I will then proceed to extract longitudinal values of relevant cardiometabolic traits (LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, BMI, etc.) for each woman, and calculate the timing of each value relative to the FMP. Then, women will be categorized based on the trajectory of each cardiometabolic trait around the time of menopause. Finally, we will search for genetic and covariate associations with each trajectory category.","Anticipated Findings
If successful, this study could take a step towards understanding how and why different women react differently to menopause, in terms of their cardiometabolic health. This could help to identify women who may be likely to experience particular cardiometabolic risk factor trajectories before they even enter the menopausal transition, potentially allowing for early intervention and more effective prevention of disease. It could also help to better understand why menopause affects cardiometabolic risk factors through identification of particular genes that could contribute to the mechanism.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program. Chronic disease is a rising contributor to mortality and morbidity, and many chronic disease risk factors are modifiable. Learning how we can more effectively prevent and control chronic disease among diverse patient populations will be essential for population health improvement. We specifically plan to study the intersection between different chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that interact with one another and cause progressive disability.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use a combination of descriptive tools (e.g. estimating prevalence, incidence of various conditions) and modeling tools to model the accumulation of disease risk factors and mortality. Our work will be performed primarily using All of Us data with additional work performed in other population-based data sources including EHR data, UK Biobank, and other large studies.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our study will document the prevalence and risk of developing various types of multimorbidity and chronic disease burden over time and will identify novel risk factors for multimorbidity which could be targeted both to improve population health and to improve health equity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question: Is there a significant association between race/ethnicity, allostatic load, perceived stress, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among breast cancer survivors?
Racial disparities persist in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive research and intervention strategies. Examining stress and allostatic load is crucial in understanding and addressing these disparities. Chronic stress and allostatic load, which encompasses the cumulative physiological toll of stress on the body, have been linked to both CVD and breast cancer outcomes. Moreover, racial and ethnic minorities often face disproportionate levels of stress due to social determinants of health, including systemic racism, socioeconomic disadvantage, and limited access to quality healthcare. These stressors can contribute to the development and progression of both diseases and exacerbate existing health disparities.","Project Purpose(s)

It is hypothesized that there will be a significant relationship between race/ethnicity, allostatic load, perceived stress, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among breast cancer survivors. Specifically, it is expected that racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black and Hispanic individuals, will exhibit higher levels of allostatic load and perceived stress and experience poorer cardiovascular disease outcomes compared to White individuals.
The findings of this logistic regression analysis underscore the complex interplay between race/ethnicity, stress, allostatic load, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among breast cancer survivors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers. In response to FNIH RFP2 “GENERATION of New genetic, -omic, or biomarker data for Common Metabolic Diseases,” we propose to generate and discover novel genetic associations in the All of Us Research Program.","Project Purpose(s)

We will report counts and power calculations that describe the genetic associations that could be discovered in the All of Us Cohort. We will explore the availability of additional common metabolic diseases and complications and perform power calculations for these traits. We will perform genetic association analyses with each disease and outcome (type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and NAFLD).","Anticipated Findings

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition consisting of lifelong elevated LDL cholesterol levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Variants in three genes involved in LDL receptor function, LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, account for most cases. Among Western populations, the prevalence of FH has been reported to be between 1:212 to 1:331.  African ancestry individuals are underrepresented in submissions to genetic resources used to determine variant pathogenicity and there are no known reports on the prevalence of FH in those populations. Therefore, the study aims to create an African ancestry cohort to assess frequency of FH variants and outcomes such as LDL levels, use of lipid-lowering medications, and ASCVD risk among individuals in this cohort to better understand the burden of FH in this population.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to run ADMIXTURE on  genetic data from  All of Us  and other large multi-ethnic cohorts to create an African ancestry cohort. We then will assess sequence variants in the three FH genes from this cohort for pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Finally we will compare outcomes such as lipid levels , use of lipid lowering medications, and ASCVD risk  among those with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, a VUS, and without any such variant.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate finding several variants in the three known FH genes that are rare and/or poorly characterized in primarily European ancestry cohorts that confer increased risk for high LDL levels and ASCVD risk. We expect that many of the individuals with these variants will have not been adequately screened and treated for FH, and thus represent a population that could see benefits in care and lifespan with increased testing for FH variants and LDL cholesterol levels earlier in life.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In recent years, the biomedical research community has become more aware of the potential influence that a set of non-medical factors have on health outcomes (Marmot et al. 2008). Such social determinants of health (SDOH) are comprised of the conditions in which people work and live, including income, education, food security, early childhood development, social inclusion, etc. Recently, an association was observed between SDOH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients (Vinter et al. 2022). However, whether the link between SDOH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is causal and, in which direction, remains to be seen. This study is important because a statistical correlation between two variables can be explained by multiple underlying causal networks and knowledge of the causal network can help focus research and healthcare delivery.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease(s))
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will develop a list of confounders, SDOH exposures of interest and outcomes of adverse cardiovascular conditions / events, based on a literature review and evaluation of the data available to us. We will formulate these into a series of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) per exposure-outcome model.
We will begin transforming and building our analytic dataset. We will make use of the various tools AllOfUs provides via Workbench platform. These tools include: Workspaces, R and Python, Dataset Builders and Cohort Builders.
We will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA).
We will then calculate propensity score models and employ inverse probability weighting (IPW) to weight regression models. Doubly robust methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) can be explored. Alternative to TMLE, a factor analysis can be performed on various SDOH and demographic survey measures available. These aggregate factors could then be utilized as exposures in our IPW regression models.","Anticipated Findings
Ideally, this study will answer the following question: What is the strength and direction of the causal relationship between multiple SDOH exposures and adverse cardiovascular outcomes? Currently, many SDOH exposures are associated with a variety of poor medical outcomes. We expect our models to show that some SDOH exposures do not causally influence adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and that other factors do have a causal influence and to what magnitude. Knowledge of the underlying causal structure can help focus public policy and healthcare delivery on SDOH factors that really matter to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease(s).","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to investigate and compare the contribution of cardiovascular disease risk factors on CVD outcomes among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that premenopausal women who are non-diabetic are protected against CVD in comparison to age-matched males. But the differences attenuated among post-menopausal women who were not on hormone replacement therapy. Menopause is associated with high blood pressure, high BMI, dyslipidemia and cholesterol accumulation and also associated with decrease in estrogen indicating that menopause and hormone status can account for the observed sex-differences. Here, we will explore the age-related differences in contributions of CVD risk factors among women. This will inform and support clinicians, scientist and public health professionals on clinically meaningful age-related differences and create awareness for prevention of CVD.","Project Purpose(s)

The participants will be analyzed across all races, ethnicities and geographical regions and education and income level. The data will be checked for normality; descriptive characteristics and associations will be summarized. A univariate regression analysis and risk ratio between each risk factor and CVD outcome will be performed. A p value of <0.05 will be used to indicate statistical significance.","Anticipated Findings

We will calculate the scores using 1- Data manipulation: Using python and BigQuery to: A- Retrieve medications (diabetes), lab measurements including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, race, and smoking information provided by participants  2- Visualization: A- Creating histogram for calculated scores using python visualization library Matplotlib","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity and importance of the data collected by the program and can be challenging to extract from medical records (smoking status) by showing by calculating the cardiovascular risk within 10 years. We expect to find: 1) the easiness in using data from different sources (EHR and survey data) to build a model or calculate a risk. 2) the heterogeneity in All of Us population where underrepresented population in clinical trials or clinical data set are more present in the All of Us  3) the cardiovascular risk score is different in racial groups.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My study question is “Genetic factors of low-density lipoprotein level cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration in blood among Asian population.” LDL-C is related to the development of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death all over the world, representing one in three causes of death. This is a public health issue. In my study, I will explore genetic variations affecting LDL-C among Asians since there is a lack of data on cholesterol studies on Asians. This research will help to understand the genetic contribution to LDL-C and discover medication targets.","Project Purpose(s)

Treatment outcomes for cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are disproportionally poorer among racial and ethnic
minority patients. Black/African American (BAA) hypertension patients are less likely to have their blood pressure
controlled as compared to non-Hispanic White (nHW) patients. Nonadherence to the medications used for
treating CMDs is one of the major reasons for these observed disparities because optimal adherence to CMD
medications (antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic) is associated with 20-38% lower risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. BAAs, compared with non-Hispanic Whites (nHWs), are 37-80% less likely to
fully adhere with these CMD medications. The public health and economic burden of nonadherence to CMD
medications is steep. Thus, nonadherence is a major determinant of the disproportionately high burden of CVDs
among racial and ethnic minority populations in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.

Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in  patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our study aims to address several key questions related to the interplay of genetic and environmental
factors in the development of CVDs in patients with SLE and RA. Specifically, we seek to investigate:
(1) The role of genetic variation in the susceptibility of SLE and RA patients to CVDs.
(2) How environmental factors, such as lifestyle choices and comorbidities, interact with genetic
predispositions to impact CVD risk in SLE and RA cohorts.
(3) Whether there exist shared genetic and environmental risk factors between SLE and RA
contributing to CVD development, or if distinct mechanisms underpin CVD pathogenesis in each
condition.","Project Purpose(s)

Statins are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications that significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk patients. However, medication nonadherence, often attributed to reported side effects such as muscle pain, remains a significant barrier to their effectiveness. Genetic variations in the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene, responsible for encoding organic anion transporter polypeptide 1b1 (OATP1B1) and facilitating statin uptake into tissues, may impact statin efficacy and safety. Decreased statin concentrations can lead to reduced effectiveness in lowering LDL-C levels, while increased systemic exposure increases the risk of muscle-related symptoms. This study seeks to assess the influence of the rs4149056 (SLCO1B1*5) genotype on statin switching, discontinuation, and the incidence of clinical events such as myopathy and major adverse cardiovascular events.","Project Purpose(s)

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concern. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications for CKD and DM. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities. The study will also use predictive tools such as machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes in diabetes patients such as Uncontrolled Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications.

Up to 1 in 12 people worldwide is estimated to suffer from hearing loss, with 38 million Americans among them. Currently approved therapy for hearing loss in all its varieties is limited to sound amplification or surgical implants for those with more severe hearing loss. The effect of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockade, a target of anti-hypertensive medications, in human hearing loss has not been extensively explored. Age related hearing loss, or presbycusis, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, with hypertension serving as a predictor of faster rates of hearing decline. RAS-targeted treatments have the potential for system-wide vasoprotective effects and thus preserve hearing. To establish the RAS as a therapeutic target, we propose to examine the effect angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on development and progression of hearing loss using the AllofUs patient database.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Explore for an association of treatment with RAS-blockers and rates of hearing loss diagnoses among all patients who underwent treatment with anti-hypertensive medications. This query will compare two groups with otherwise similar baseline characteristics: 1) patients with a hypertension diagnosis who underwent pharmacotherapy for the treatment of hypertension with one or more of several common medication classes (diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers), versus 2) patients with hypertension who underwent treatment with ACEis or ARBs. These groups will be assessed for differences in the frequency of diagnostic codes for hearing loss (e.g. ICD 9 code 389.1 and 389.2), levels of hearing loss defined by audiometry (mild, moderate, severe, or profound), and for frequency of cochlear implantation (e.g. ICD 9 codes 20.96 to 20.98).","Anticipated Findings
We expect these comparisons to provide important information regarding the protective benefits of agents targeting the classical RAS as a novel otoprotective approach. These studies will have a positive impact and clinical relevance since they will inform future animal studies and human clinical trials regarding the use of existing, well-established medications for a novel indication of the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. They may also provide more substantial evidence of the benefit of these established pharmacologic strategies in treating other common microvascular and macrovascular diseases. Additionally, they may spur further investigation into novel therapies targeting the protective axis within the RAS (e.g. ACE2 activators, Ang-(1-7) or AT2R agonists). This is consistent with our long-term goal to aid in the translation of research of the ear’s endogenous protective systems into bedside therapeutics for patients at risk of hearing loss.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This study will train University of Pittsburgh researchers on working with All of Us Project data. Goal: since the PCSK9 R46L variant is linked to lower LDL levels & decreased cardiovascular risk in Europeans, we would like to examine its effects in the ancestrally diverse AoU dataset. Objectives: establish R46L prevalence in the AoU dataset & explore its association with plasma lipids & heart disease. Research questions: 1) Do demographics & lipid distributions differ between individuals with/without heart disease, influenced by sex/ancestry? 2) Do lipid levels vary between R46L genotype groups, affected by sex/ancestry? 3) What is the association between R46L alternate alleles & mean LDL levels after adjusting for factors?","Project Purpose(s)

In this workspace, based on our results generated from French participants, we aim to confirm associations between rare, loss-of-function or gain-of-function DNA variants and the risk of metabolic disorders (or the level of associated traits) using All of Us. The rare variants will be located either i/ in coding exons from candidate genes involved in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or in associated traits, or ii/ in non-coding genomic loci. To assess the functional effect of DNA variants we will either use in silico and/or in vitro studies. This project should lead to the identification or confirmation of functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the following datasets: whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA arrays
For WES and WGS, the analysis will be focused on rare variants in specific loci  (specific genes or specific non coding regions).or interest. DNA arrayswill be used for the calculation of genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for metabolic disorders or traits.
Genetic association analyses will be done between genetic markers (rare variants and/or PRS) and metabolic traits, when adjusting for relevant covariates (including sex, age, ancestry for instance).
Of note, to refine the analyses, we will use a functional genetic approach focusing on rare variants found in All of Us. For these in vitro studies, we have notably developed genome editing (i.e. CRISPR/cas9) in several human cell lines, which enables the functional analyses of small genomic regions (like an entire enhancer) or even of a single point mutation.","Anticipated Findings
This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population. Mounting evidence indicates that this impact disproportionately affects minority populations. Most factors underlying these health disparities pertain to the social determinants of health, but it is unclear how biological factors play a role or interact with these social determinants. The main questions of this study are: (1) can we use All of US to identify novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are specific to a given minority group? (2) Are existing risk factors for CVD shared across all minority groups? (3) Can we disentangle the contributions of social determinants of health and biological factors contributing to cardiovascular disease?

We will use linear and logistic regression to test for association between risk factors, social determinants of health, genomic risk scores, and the conditions of interest, and product terms to test for effect modification between contributor variables.","Anticipated Findings

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment.

We wish to investigate what are there are genetic determinants or risk factors of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is a common infertility disorder affecting approximately 8-13% of women who are of reproductive-age. While common, PCOS is also a complex and multifactorial disease without a clear genetic cause. PCOS overlaps with other diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndromes. It is not clear if these associated diseases are caused by or are consequences of PCOS, or if PCOS and these other disease collectively have a common cause. In addition, women with PCOS have negative body image perceptions, low self-esteem, depression, and decreased quality of life. There is a need to increase knowledge surrounding the risk factors and determinants of PCOS to improve risk identification, disease diagnosis, and disease treatment and management options.","Project Purpose(s)

In order to determine what genetic risk factors are contributing to PCOS, we plan to explore genetic variants in women with PCOS to women without PCOS. After identifying any genetic variants, we will look at candidate genes more closely and see if there are any functionally relevant mutations when comparing the two groups. We will explore PCOS correlations in different cohort groups such as age, genetic ancestry, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, geography, if applicable. We will also look at correlations of the genetics between PCOS and other diseases starting with known associated diseases such like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. We plan to create summary statistics and graphical visualizations of our results to include in research presentations and peer-reviewed research articles.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate that our findings will identify candidate genetic determinants of PCOS in women with PCOS overall and will help us identify subpopulations of PCOS.

The number of people living with congenital heart defects (CHD)  is increasing. In addition, these patients are aging and in need of specialized care. Despite the improved survival outcomes for these patients, health disparities with respect to the frequency of cardiovascular monitoring, health care access, transition to adult care, and the quality of care, still exist. These health inequities contribute to the high mortality late in life for some CHD conditions. We aim to identify key equity gaps in cardiac monitoring, particularly in the transition from pediatric to adult care, that may contribute to the health disparities that arise and persist throughout adulthood.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to find out what factors lead to drop off from care or what factors contribute to prolonged engagement in clinical follow-up.","Anticipated Findings
The study will allow us to understand which factors lead to more engagement in clinical follow-up and cardiovascular monitoring in patients with congenital heart defects. In addition, the findings will also demonstrate if there is a relationship with clinical follow-up throughout a patient's life and health outcomes specific to the defect the patient was diagnosed with.

Obesity is a growing national epidemic that is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular mortality and disability. Studies have shown that dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis is related to metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. We are interested in the role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex in obesity. The MCU complex is the key regulator of mitochondrial calcium signaling; functional defects of MCU causes dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Genetic variation of MCU and its association with obesity and vascular disease is unknown. Thus, the goral of our study is to identify single nucleotide variants in the MCU gene which are associated with obesity and vascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Hypertension is a very prevalent disease that results in significant morbidity and mortality.  Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.  The prevalence of hypertension increases with age.  The goal of hypertension treatment is to reduce morbidity and mortality.  Our research aims to determine the extent of how social determinants of health (social cohesion, crime rates in neighborhood, transportation, healthcare affordability, healthcare access, etc.) affect women over 50.  We expect that various social determinants of health might negatively affect hypertension control in women in this age group.

When one hears the phrase ""health disparities"" they instantly think of traditional differences such as race, age, and physical impairment in chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and arthritis. What many fail to realize is there are additional groups that make up a large proportion of individuals that lack access to and/or receive very little information regarding different diseases and outcomes. The conditions in these subpopulations are often reported more when it comes to drug and/or alcohol abuse or mental illnesses. But why? Why isn't the playing field leveled to where all people can have access to information that may be vital to their health if not access to insurance and the proper care?

This study will primarily investigate whether a multidimensional whole health index, integrating measures of physical, mental, social, environmental, and financial well-being, offers a more robust prediction of chronic disease risk – including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers – within the ""All of Us"" cohort compared to traditional risk models that often rely heavily on clinical factors. Additionally, the research will explore if and how disparities across demographic groups (age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) are reflected in variations in these whole health metrics and whether these variations potentially explain differences in chronic disease burden.   A successful outcome could enhance chronic disease prediction capabilities, empowering healthcare providers with more accurate tools for early intervention and personalized prevention strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
My research methods will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation matrices to gain a comprehensive understanding of data distributions and relationships among variables.  Operationalizing whole health domains into quantifiable metrics will be crucial (for example, using survey scores validated for mental health assessment ). Factor analysis will be employed to reduce dimensionality within the dataset. Regression analysis will then determine the relationships between the whole health index and chronic disease outcomes while controlling for confounding factors. Finally, I'll leverage machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks, to enhance predictive capabilities, identify key features, and effectively model complex interactions","Anticipated Findings
The overarching hypothesis is that the multidimensional whole health index will significantly outperform traditional risk models for chronic disease prediction. Additionally, it's anticipated that certain whole health domains might emerge as particularly strong predictors for specific chronic diseases (e.g., the role of social isolation in cardiovascular health). Crucially, the study aims to unveil how variations in whole health metrics align with patterns of chronic disease distribution across demographic groups, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms driving health disparities. These findings have the potential to revolutionize how we approach chronic disease risk assessment, going beyond isolated risk factors to a more holistic and personalized framework. The identified key whole health metrics will pinpoint crucial areas for targeted interventions at both the individual and population health level.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The association between participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and improved cardiovascular outcomes, including reductions in recurrent cardiovascular events, readmissions, mortality, and depression and anxiety is well described. Previous studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic differences in CR participation, as well as the influence of socioeconomic factors on differences in participation in CR between racial and ethnic groups. Few studies have explored racial differences in CR outcomes, as well as the impact of other social factors, including household composition, primary language, health literacy, and employment status, on CR participation. Identifying these factors can allow for the timely and targeted development of interventions to increase initiation of CR, especially among minority populations, and improve long term outcomes of cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
I plan to perform a retrospective cohort study on adults ≥18 years with first time CR-qualifying diagnoses per ICD coding, with qualifying individuals grouped into CR initiation and non-initiation groups. Bivariate associations will be made between the two groups based on characteristics including race, copayment, primary language, household composition, and employment status, with a t test used for continuous variables and a chi-square test for categorical variables. Groups will be compared CR initiator and non-initiators will also be compared for overall survival, and then stratified by racial differences. A logistic regression model will also be constructed to to predict CR initiation as a function of variables including race, copayment, primary language, household composition, and employment status.","Anticipated Findings
Given that participation in CR has been historically and significantly lower in Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations compared to White individuals, further exploration into the socioeconomic factors that influence racial differences in utilization of CR services and their possible ramifications on long-term mortality and other clinical endpoints is urgently warranted.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Participant surveys, Electronic health records, Census and administrative data linked at the census tract level
Outcomes: Primary - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia)
Secondary - Peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, stroke, myocardial infarction

Descriptive Analysis: We will examine the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors, conditions, and outcomes among pregnant women in the cohort using summary statistics. These will include body mass index, chronic hypertension, diabetes, smoking, insurance status and others.
Outcomes: The primary outcome will be hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes are peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, stroke, and myocardial infarction.
Main Analysis: We will fit logistic regression models to estimate the associations between neighborhood-level economic, social, and environmental exposures (independent variables) and cardiovascular outcomes (dependent variables), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity and other relevant confounders. Effect modification by individual SES will be assessed.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show treatment patterns using data and electronic health records from different sites across the country. We expect to find (1) variation in the medication sequences prescribed to treat All of Us participants who have type 2 diabetes and hypertension; (2) the most common medication used to treat participants as the first line therapy for type 2 diabetes and hypertension; (3) a trend or change over time in what is/are the most common medication(s) prescribed first over the study period; and (4) trend or change overtime for the percentage of participants who were treated using only one medication class (monotherapy). Importantly, the detailed code developed will be made available within the Researcher Workbench, so other researchers may more easily extract medication data and class information using a common medication ontology.

Are there specific genetic variants associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients with diabetes?
What is the prevalence of cardiovascular genetic risk factors among the diabetic Hispanic population?
Studying genetic variations linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes individuals, especially in the Hispanic community, is essential for progressing personalize care and improving health outcomes. Identifying distinct genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is the first step in developing personalized prevention and treatment approaches, especially in minority groups like US Hispanics. Further, a better understanding genetic predisposition may improve our biological understanding of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and facilitate specific therapies to lessen the burden of cardiovascular problems in this at-risk population.","Project Purpose(s)

Cohort selection: Create cohort of diabetic patients in the All of Us program. We will then identify patients who develop the outcome of interest (the presence of cardiovascular disease [CVD]).

Generating Descriptive statistics of the population:
Statistical Analysis: The use of statistical software (eg. Python) to generate descriptive statistics for the diabetes cohort. It will include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
Candidate gene study to identify if candidate SNPs (rs6923761, rs57922, rs9299870) are associated with risk of CVD in diabetes patients. This will involve the association of these SNPs within cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings: Specific genetic variations, interacting with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling system, provide a complex risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We anticipate that genetic variations in the GLP-1 signaling system may impact the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists by affecting insulin production, glucose metabolism, and atherosclerosis as well as overall cardiovascular risk. The study's findings are anticipated to improve our comprehension of why specific diabetes patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and how their reaction to therapy can differ depending on genetic factors. This method not only seeks to enhance scientific understanding but also strives to tackle healthcare inequalities and enhance public health results by customizing interventions to suit the unique requirements of individual patients, according to their genetic makeup.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is crucial for effective intervention and personalized medicine. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged as a promising tool for identifying individuals at high risk of developing CVD and other complex diseases.

Gout is an inflammatory metabolic disease affecting > 4% of US adults, including > 9% of those over age 65.  People with gout can experience very painful and disabling attacks (flares) in their joints and are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.
Gout results from high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricaemia) and studies by our group and others have identified many environmental, clinical, and genetic factors associated with gout. These include diuretic medications (increased risk), and coffee and vitamin C (decreased risk).  However, despite evidence that gout is having a greater impact on men and women in non-White racial groups in the US, most factors were identified in people of self-reported White race.
To address these gaps, we are exploring the AllofUs data to plan future studies on the environmental, genetic, and clinical factors associated with gout (or worse gout outcomes) in women and men of different racial/ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate using the EHR data and self-reported survey data to classify participants’ gout status and uric acid levels.

We anticipate using logistic regression models to evaluate the association between exposures and the risk of gout or hyperuricemia, adjusting for well-established gout risk factors such as overweight/obesity and use of diuretic medications.  We will also assess for joint effects and interactions between exposures, including genetic exposures drawn from the Genomics dataset.  For example, our prior analysis of a different cohort of mainly White adults found that excess BMI can exacerbate the impact of carrying certain hyperuricemia genes on the risk of gout.  Mediation analysis will be performed to quantify factors influencing sex- or racial differences in the burden of gout.","Anticipated Findings

Thus, this study will seek to identify correlations between heart rate, blood pressure, metrics of arterial stiffness (e.g., load versus structural stiffness), and socioeconomic variables.","Project Purpose(s)

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow acquire somatic mutations that lead to overgrowth of a genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells. The prevalence of CHIP detectable through next-generation sequencing of blood DNA is up to 10% of adults >70 years and nearly 20% of adults >90 years. CHIP has major implications for human health as a risk factor for age-related chronic diseases including hematologic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, and all-cause mortality. We performed GWAS for CHIP in AoU. This workspace to store CHIP GWAS summary stats.","Project Purpose(s)

Treatment outcomes for cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are disproportionally poorer among racial and ethnic minority patients. Black/African American (BAA) hypertension patients are less likely to have their blood pressure controlled as compared to non-Hispanic White (nHW) patients. Nonadherence to the medications used for treating CMDs is one of the major reasons for these observed disparities because optimal adherence to CMD medications (antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic) is associated with 20-38% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. BAAs, compared with non-Hispanic Whites (nHWs), are 37-80% less likely to fully adhere with these CMD medications. The public health and economic burden of nonadherence to CMD medications is steep. Thus, nonadherence is a major determinant of the disproportionately high burden of CVDs among racial and ethnic minority populations in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

This proposed study would result in the creation of accurate and validated ML-based models for identifying patients who are most likely to become nonadherent to CMD medications.

Can machine-learning-based models properly identify the heterogeneity of the effect of individual-level policy interventions through access to care and utilization of healthcare services on major cardiovascular outcomes with observational data from a high-dimensional database using the All of Us Research Project, given different levels of social disparities?
ML models have gained popularity in recent years, nonetheless, there is a gap between the development of these models and interpretability. In this project I aim to describe a pipeline for the implementation of ML models, starting from their scientific validation and prioritizing real-world interpretability, with the aim to create a new methodological approach to evaluate implementation policies regarding health access holding justice and fight against social vulnerabilities at the center.","Project Purpose(s)

Analysis will be done in R and Python using the integrated Jupyter Notebooks in the workbench. I will explore models such as logistic regression,  classification and regression tree, random forest, gradient-boosted machine models. Other interpretability methods such as partial dependence plots and shapley additive explanations will be used. Other tools for database management such as SQL commands will be used.
The All of Us dataset will be used, with a focus on capturing a diverse and broad population of the dataset, nonetheless, it is important to understand how the effects of social determinants of health impact health outcomes, hence, I will use interpretability methods to identify the impact of individual features on MACE outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that social determinants of health have a bigger impact on health outcomes (cardiovascular health) than access to healthcare services, nonetheless, the impact can be differential across groups, meaning that our traditional models of health policy (top-down approaches in a one-size-fits-all) could actually be increasing disparities. Another hypothesis is that more complex machine learning methods such as GBM will have a better performance than traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression, without compromising scientific rigor. I also anticipate to find a useful pipeline to analyze the differential effects across populations of healthcare systemic interventions, which could be used for future research in health policy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The relationship between common behavioral risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and physical activities with cardiovascular diseases has been well described. However, it is noted that the higher misclassification and missingness on those factors from self-report source is observed, compared with demographic factors or biomarkers. There has been numerous methods developed to account for these measurement error such as imputation and re-classification based on clustering method. In this study, we aim at investigating the whether the use of polygenic risk score of behavioral risk factors could help refine the prediction of cardiovascular diseases, with or without controlling for self-reported data of those risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

For this project, behavioral risk factor measurements, basic demographic variables,  biomarker covariates such as blood pressure and BMI and history of cardiovascular - related disease would be needed. Also, we would need information on the genotype.
We would first construct a sparse polygenic risk score for various types of behavioral risk factors based on significant loci found in the All of US population and/or previous genome-wide association studies. Lasso regression and random survival forest would be applied to select the best set of PRS. Then we would apply PRS in the prediction of CVD along with other covariates, to investigate the improvement of prediction brought by the inclusion of behavioral risk factor PRS, in multi-ancestry population.","Anticipated Findings
We assume that the inclusion of behavioral risk factor PRS could help refine the prediction of the cardiovascular diseases, especially for behavioral traits that has relatively high heritability pattern.

Our goal is to assess risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to allow identification of at-risk individuals of all minoritized groups for prevention. We aim to assess metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity among minoritized groups and if patterns of severity are different between sub-groups, to derive separate severity scores by group. We will further assess roles of SDOH in worsening severity between groups and evaluate long-term risk prediction for future CVD—all with the goal of providing detailed guidance for researchers and healthcare providers for CVD preventative care.
To these ends, we aim to answer the following questions:
-	Are there differences in MetS manifestation among marginalized groups?
-	If there are differences, how do severity scores derived within a group compare to those previously derived?
-	What are the relationships between MetS severity and SDOH?
-	Are there differences in CVD or T2D outcomes longitudinally by group?","Project Purpose(s)

Using the Controlled level v7 data to access EHR data from each participant, we will use confirmatory factor analysis of MetS components among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender sub-groups and assess how these differ from prior estimates, deriving group-specific MetS z-scores. Sub-groups will be assessed for differences in correlations between SDOH data and MetS severity. Finally, we will assess CVD and T2D, including new diagnosis and mortality relative to MetS z-scores at multiple time points.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that MetS manifests differently among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender subgroups, warranting derivation of separate MetS-Z scores to guide identification and treatment for MetS-related risk. We further hypothesize that a large portion of this risk is related to SDOH burden in minoritized groups. In all sub-groups, we expect that higher scores will predict new disease outcomes. Deriving MetS-Z scores for each sub-group would enable more specific clinical assessment of future disease risk by sub-group. Identification of relationships between MetS severity, SDOH, and CVD outcomes would highlight the medical harm of experienced discrimination and could help in risk stratification for groups not normally seen as having elevated CVD risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the industrialized nations. Countries with emerging economies are also facing increasing burden of cardiovascular disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) shares many common traditional risk factors with CVD.  These risk factors are growing in the community along with increasing burden of CVD and CKD.
Several predictive models are in clinical practice to stratify cardiovascular risk in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple studies suggest chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes and increased rate of cardiovascular events. However, there is a lack of consensus in using renal impairment as one of the predictor variables in assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with CVD.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, affecting an estimated 75 million people. This number is expected to increase to 110 million by the year 2040. Both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the two most common forms of glaucoma, disproportionately affect racial minorities in comparison to Whites in the United States. Allostatic load is a measurement that draws upon multiple bodily systems (cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, neuroendocrine) to estimate a person’s physiologic stress and allostatic coping mechanisms. Drivers of allostatic load include any chronic stressors, such as occupational stress, social isolation, and racial discrimination. Prior studies have linked other systemic diseases to allostatic load, but specific association between allostatic load and glaucoma has only been inferred.

Greenspaces and Well-Being,"The primary aim of this research is to analyze the role of green spaces in influencing physical and psychological well-being (e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression, quality of life, psychological resilience) within a diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program.…","Scientific Questions Being Studied
The primary aim of this research is to analyze the role of green spaces in influencing physical and psychological well-being (e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression, quality of life, psychological resilience) within a diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program. Additionally, we aim to explore potential effect modifiers, including age, sex at birth, self-reported race and ethnicity, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, in shaping these relationships. In the present study, we hypothesize that higher levels of greenness in the neighborhood would be associated with better physical and psychological outcomes. In addition, we hypothesize that higher greenness would be more beneficial in certain contexts defined by age, sex assigned at birth, self-reported race and ethnicity, and neighborhood socioeconomic status.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To assess exposure to greenness, we will leverage satellite images to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on seasonal estimates from Landsat satellite data for each zipcode within the contiguous U.S. from 2010-2022. We intend to identify physician-diagnosed cases of cardiovascular, depression, and anxiety conditions by utilizing billing codes in electronic health records, specifically employing a pre-defined set of SNOMED codes. Furthermore, we plan to examine additional outcomes of well-being, including quality of life, general mental health, loneliness, perceived stress, and psychological resilience measured using self-reported surveys. To analyze the impact of greenness on physical and psychological well-being, we will employ Cox proportional hazards models, while also stratifying the analysis by age, sex assigned at birth, and self-reported race and ethnicity. The R survival package will be utilized to perform this statistical analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that findings from the current study will enhance our understanding of the potential protective effects of green spaces on physical and mental health outcomes. By leveraging the All of Us Research Program’s extensive geographic coverage and diverse population, we expect to have sufficient statistical power to explore variations in these relationships across different demographic contexts, thereby identifying  vulnerable populations and informing targeted policies and urban planning to reduce health disparities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will attempt to identify the causal variants shaping lipoprotein(a) Lp(a) levels in non-European populations, and to develop an accurate predictor of lipoprotein(a) levels (Lp(a)) in these populations.  Lp(a) is an important and heritable causal risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that is genetically controlled by variants at a single genomic locus (LPA).   The genetics of Lp(a) involve complex interactions between a structural variant at LPA and sequence variants that exhibit pervasive cis-epistasis.

Sexual and Gender Minorities (SGM), SGM of color in particular, have heightened rates of cardiovascular disease. However, it is not clear how cardiovascular disease risk changes over time. This is vitally important information due to the importance of timing prevention interventions to be optimally impactful. Further, it is important to understand the factors that may mitigate the negative effects of cardiovascular disease. In this analysis we will examine trajectories of cardiovascular risk in the All of Us longitudinal research cohort. In addition, we will examine differences in the trajectories by race, gender, sexual orientation and their intersection on trajectories of cardiovascular risk. Further, we will examine if features of social life like social support and residence mitigate the negative effects of cardiovascular disease. We anticipate clarifying how cardiovascular risk changes over time between multiple different ethic/racial, sexual orientation and gender groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the survey and biological datasets for this analysis, including the social determinants of health data. We will operationalize cardiovascular risk using a composite of cardiovascular risk factors including c-reactive protein, body mass index, etc. In addition, we will stratify our sample by biological sex due to the ways in which cardiovascular risk operate differentially between biological women and men. We will utilize generalized linear modeling to test our study hypothesis. Further, we will utilize the survey data in All of Us to determine how place of residence (e.g. urban vs. rural) and social support from friends or family may operate to lower cardiovascular risk overtime.","Anticipated Findings
This study will characterize how cardiovascular risk functions over time among sexual and gender minorities and specifically among sexual and gender minorities of color. This will allow us to more precisely establish when prevention interventions may be most effectively across time. In addition, examining potential ""buffers"" will allow us to explore new avenues where we may be able to create effective prevention interventions to protect SGM from cardiovascular disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The objectives of this study are to assess trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) and trajectories of physical activity separately among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) of color, heterosexuals of color, in comparison to White sexual and gender minorities, as well as White heterosexuals.
A secondary aim of this study is to assess how trajectories of physical activity are associated with changes in HRV among SGM and heterosexuals of color. SGM are shown to have higher rates of harmful cardiometabolic health behaviors when compared to cisgender heterosexuals.
The final aim of this study is to cross-sectionally investigate if physical activity mediates the association between discrimination and HRV among SGM and heterosexuals. Exposure to discrimination may lead to increased cardiovascular risk through behavioral and physiological pathways such as unhealthy coping behaviors or blunted diurnal cortisol slopes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The present study plans to utilize most of the data available through All of Us which contains electronic health records, biological specimen measurements, and Fitbit measurements. This also includes demographic characteristics of participants such as age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race. Survey measurement data will also be included such as depressive symptoms, and discrimination. Covariates of cardiovascular disease will also be investigated such as familial history of a heart disease, tobacco use, alcohol use frequency, and other substance use. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured through the Fitbit data available and will be treated appropriately with established methods. HRV will be explored through multiple measures such as resting heart rate (interbeat interval), differences between heartbeats, low-frequency (LF) power, and high-frequency (HF) power.
Researchers will investigate trajectories with a longitudinal perspective.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that SGM of color will have faster decreasing trajectories of HRV and physical activity compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Additionally, we predict that decreasing trajectories of physical activity will be associated with poorer trajectories of cardiometabolic health, with associations pronounced for SGM of color compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Lastly, we hypothesize that greater exposure to discrimination will be associated with decreased physical activity which results in lower HRV among SGM, especially those of color.
The findings of this study will contribute to the current emerging field of sexual and gender minority health. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and this effect is more pronounced for individuals in possession of a minority identity. Findings will provide an additional look into how discrimination affects CVD risk among racial and ethnic groups of SGM.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose of this proposed study is to examine the association between lifetime Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and overall cardiovascular health, including prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). There is a growing amount of data that suggests a long-term relationship between PTSD and cardiovascular health, cardiovascular risk factors, risk for CVD events, and CVD prognosis. However, most studies investigated the association between PTSD and an individual CVD risk factor or behavior separately, and few studies investigated overall cardiovascular health. As a result, the evidence of the association between PTSD and overall cardiovascular health, including all major CVD risk factors and behaviors, has not been reported. Therefore, this study aims to answer if PTSD is related to increased overall cardiovascular risks.","Project Purpose(s)

For defining groups, we will use the ICD-10 codes for PTSD and CVD. We will also utilize some relevant variables to generate cardiovascular health, comprising four risk factors and behaviors. The overall cardiovascular score is the unweighted average of the 8 component metric scores, ranging from 0 to 100. For analysis, compare overall cardiovascular health scores between PTSD and non-PTSD groups.","Anticipated Findings

We will evaluate the general epidemiology for e-cigarette use and we will study the relationships with other key variables having to do with life stressors of other lifestyle habits.  Besides, we will explore whether e-cig use can lead to cardiovascular health effects.
E-cigarette use has gained popularity, with the patterns of use changing rapidly, raising concerns about its potential health consequences. By studying the current epidemiology and investigating the relationship between e-cigarette use and other lifestyle traits, we can shed light on the overall health implications of e-cigarette use. Moreover, exploring the association between e-cigarette use and incident hypertension is critical due to the growing prevalence of both e-cigarette use and hypertension, particularly in young individuals. Understanding this potential link can guide public health policies, healthcare strategies, and health education efforts to mitigate hypertension-related risks among e-cigarette users.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the extensive All of Us dataset as our primary data source. With its diverse participant pool and comprehensive data on demographics and health-related variables, the dataset offers a robust foundation for our research. We intend to utilize relevant baseline variables, including e-cigarette use, lifestyle variables including psychological stressors, and baseline hypertension status. The analyses for our first aim will be cross-sectional, employing logistic regression and related methods. For the second aim, we will ascertain incident health status – specifically incident hypertension – from the data derived from linked EHR files. These analyses will employ Cox proportional hazards regression and related survival analysis techniques. Our team's multidisciplinary expertise equips us to conduct and oversee rigorous analysis. In addition to our primary research questions, we will broaden our analysis to encompass other health outcomes related to e-cigarette use.","Anticipated Findings
The study aims to explore plausible associations between e-cigarette use, and other lifestyle patterns including other tobacco use and illicit drug use, psychosocial stressors, and incident hypertension, leveraging the All of Us dataset. The anticipated outcomes may unveil correlations and associations between e-cigarette use and heightened psychosocial stress levels, coupled with an increased risk of developing hypertension. These findings could expand our current understanding of the health implications of e-cigarettes, potentially guiding proactive strategies and targeted interventions. The results have the potential to enhance scientific insights by untangling the intricate pathways linking e-cigarette use, psychosocial determinants, and the occurrence of hypertension.

1) What is the prevalence of different types of cardiovascular disease in people with cancer?
2) What types of cardiovascular disease are associated with specific types of cancer treatment?
3) Are there genetic variants associated with cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease?
These questions are important because the number of cancer survivors is projected to reach 30 million by 2030 and there are increased rates of cardiovascular disease in patients treated for cancer compared to patients who were not treated for cancer. Capability to identify which patients are at risk of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease would allow early intervention with cardioprotective strategies. If there is a genetic component to cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease, genetic profiling could be used to 1) Identify at risk patients prior to treatment; 2) Better understand the the mechanism of toxicity, 3) Develop new cardioprotective drugs.","Project Purpose(s)

In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern.

I intend to uncover genomic variants that are linked to cardiac shape measuerements. My primary purpose is to investigate quantitatively how changes in heart shape affect different patients' cardiovascular disease outcomes. Are these changes in heart shape also explained by genomic variants? Exploring these differences can aid in diagnosis and treatment of diffeerent cardiovascular disease phenotypes. For example, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients have markably different symptoms. A major difference in diagnosis can be due to a patient's underlying genetic makup of the heart. This connection is something we also hope to look into further.","Project Purpose(s)

I plan to use the whole genome sequencing datasets. I plan to use plink and structural variant callers to impute genomic SNPs and SVs that are correlated to shape measurements. I believe AllofUs has shape measurement data out there, including mass, volume, and ejection fraction measuremnts of the heart. If MRI data is also available, I plan to analyze images of the hearts. We have a pipeline developed to take several different guide points and landmarks in MRIs to characterize heart shape. We use the basic measurements and then use dimensional reduction to get a set of normalized principal components for each patient. I will then use a sort of GWAS or some other association method to correlate the genomic variants and heart shape measurements.
