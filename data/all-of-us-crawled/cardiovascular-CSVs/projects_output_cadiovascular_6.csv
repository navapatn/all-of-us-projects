Statins are a cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States. Despite the conclusive evidence to the reduction of mortality among ASCVD patients, adherence patterns to this treatment remain alarmingly low with rates of discontinuity approaching 50% in the US population. Current research investigating this pattern have elucidated the impact of clinic-specific factors and patient-physician interactions, but these studies have been limited in generalizability as a result of operating in isolated health care systems. I seek to implement novel computational techniques to analyze patient record data en masse and to uncover the epidemiology of treatment adherence and to address unmet clinical needs of particularly vulnerable patient populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze electronic health records in the aggregate. This will allow the identification of patterns of treatment adherence for statin medication across the population.","Anticipated Findings
Previous research has suggested that patient adherence is multilayer, affected by factors like differences in clinical systems, patient-physician interaction, and systemic inequality. However, the difficulty of parsing through unstructured clinical notes has reduced many study designs to look at single health care systems and introduce significant bias in the findings. This has limited a robust understanding of the epidemiology of statin use and have likely contributed to unmet clinical needs of patients particularly from high-risk and vulnerable communities. My work will fill gaps in the understanding of statin adherence to inform future policy changes and promote better access to care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are interested in the conditions that accompany obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are conditions that are risk factors for OSA, so we expect to see those prior to a diagnosis of the sleep problem. There are also many comorbidities of OSA, such as cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and diabetes. We believe that there may be mechanisms underlying OSA and these comorbidities that are present before diagnosis. We therefore want to look at when co-occurring conditions occur before and after a diagnosis of OSA. We also wish to assess those conditions in people without OSA as a comparison.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (obstructive sleep apnea)","Scientific Approaches
We will look at conditions relative to the date of diagnosis of OSA. We will assess the timeline of occurrence of events (diagnosis, survey, vital) relative to OSA, and assess the conditions that occur early, simultaneously or late. We will look at the conditions commonly associated with OSA (CV disease, mental health, etc) in people without indication of a sleep disorder, and see whether the timeline and severity differs with the OSA group.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to see conditions occurring prior to a diagnosis of OSA. This would suggest 1) that we may be detecting OSA late, and that these conditions may be potentially able to help improve screening for OSA, and 2) we may identify possible underlying pathophysiology that could be present in OSA that is also contributing to other health problems.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population. Mounting evidence indicates that this impact disproportionately affects minority populations. This disproportionate effect is not only present in minorities defined by race/ethnicity, but also in those defined by age, sexual orientation, and other characteristics.  The main questions of this study are: (1) can we use All of US to identify novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are specific to a given minority group? (2) Are existing  risk factors for CVD shared across all minority groups? (3) How do the effects of these risk factors vary when considering more than one minority group? These questions are important to (1) identify groups of persons at particularly high risk of sustaining these conditions that may benefit from tailored diagnostic and therapeutic interventions; and (2) identify new treatments for these conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use the All of US dataset V4. We will identify variables that represent (1) cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke); (2) all the known cardiovascular risk factors for each of these conditions; (3) physiological variables that either define a risk factor or are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A1C); (4) social determinants of health; and (5) identify the underrepresented groups of interest. We will use linear and logistic regression to test for association between cardiovascular risk factors, social determinants of health, and the conditions of interest, and product terms to test for effect modification between contributor variables.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that: (1) a substantial number of the known vascular risk factors increase risk of cardiovascular disease across all evaluated groups; (2) both social determinants of health and known cardiovascular risk factors are independently associated with these cardiovascular conditions; and (3) there are interactions between the effect of social determinants of health and known cardiovascular risk factors. These findings will helps us to (1) identify groups of persons at particularly high risk of sustaining these conditions that may benefit from tailored diagnostic and therapeutic interventions; and (2) identify new treatments for these conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We primarily perform genome-wide association studies to connect genetic variants with diseases and traits. For example, genetic variants can increase or decrease an individuals cholesterol levels compared to the population average.  Through the use of polygenic scores, these variants can be combined together to identify individuals most at risk of cardiovascular disease. Tools used include BOLT-LMM, SAIGE, and custom scripts (R/Python) to perform statistical analysis.","Anticipated Findings

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women over the age of 65 in the United States, men account for more than half of the deaths due to CVD. Moreover, evidence suggests that cardiovascular disparities exist among men, such that those who identify as sexual minorities are more likely to experience poor cardiovascular health as compared to heterosexuals. The objective of this proposal is to examine physiological and behavioral mechanisms linking self-reported PTSD to cardiovascular disease risk. We also would like to understand the moderating effect of race/ethnicity. The long-term objective of this research is to inform the creation of culturally relevant interventions to reduce the risk of CVD among YSMM. The proposed study specifically aims to:","Project Purpose(s)

I will explore datasets that provide self report information on the constructs discussed above.
1. Descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics for all variables will be calculated. Distributional properties will be examined using summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, SD) and graphs (e.g., histograms and box plots). I will confirm psychometric properties (e.g., internal consistency) of all scales. All management, basic analyses, and assumption testing will be done in Stata 16.23 Hypothesis testing will be conducted in Mplus v8.24
2. Multivariate linear regression (MLR) will be used to asses if PTSD predicts mean CVD risk.
3. MLR will be used to assess if race/ethnicity moderated the association between PTSD and CVD risk.","Anticipated Findings
the mechanisms linking PTSD and intermediate cardiovascular factors among racially diverse individuals remain under-explored.  Conducting this research is vitally important considering the heightened rates of both stress from discrimination and CVD  disease. Secondly,  understanding what the potential ""buffers"" are that mitigate the negative effects of PTSD on cardiovascular risk factors is critically important if we are going to create tailored interventions to reduce CVD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

To evaluate the relationship between serum folate and heart diseases with special focus on myocardial infarction (heart attack). There is currently no consensus in the literature on the effect of elevated blood folate on cardiovascular disease outcomes. With the food fortification with folic acid mandate in the US, the average serum levels of folate has increased for not just women in their reproductive age but everyone in the US. There is a need to be sure of the effect of elevated folate on other health outcomes apart from neural tube defects. It is our hope that the relationship between folate and heart diseases will be better understood using the All of Us data for policy makers to re-evaluate the mandatory food fortification policy in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

Findings have clinical implications for prevention (e.g., vaccines), screenings, and treatments, post SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Moreover, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 will disproportionately impact underserved populations whom are at an increased risk for chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary).","Project Purpose(s)

The analysis will employ exploratory methods of data analysis such as association plots, heatmaps, and descriptive statistics. Following the exploratory analysis, generalized linear models will explore the associations further while controlling for patient characteristics and other factors. Multiplicity corrections will control the incidence of type I errors and ensure replicability of research results.

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We want to identify and characterize important disease manifestations, serologic profiles, and treatments for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There are known to be differences in these between men and women, and also among different racial groups within the United States. We are interested in also studying the variation of these with sex, race, and socioeconomic factors. Additionally comorbidities and other health characteristic such as BMI or smoking history are believed to be important in disease outcomes including other system involvement or cardiovascular events. There have not been many large databases or study cohorts with SLE patients that include detailed information about these factors that are believed to be clinically important so the All of Us database provides a unique opportunity for observational study of these factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (systemic lupus erythematosus)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to report observational data of a cross-sectional cohort of all adult patients from the All of Us database who have a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in EHR records. We will make a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics including sex, age, race, annual household income, education level, self-reported quality of life, and smoking status. Subsequent analyses will compare the presence of organ specific manifestations of SLE and of cardiovascular events between male and female participants and between races using presence of EHR codes. We will use self-reported survey data to describe the frequency of barriers to healthcare access. We will also estimate the validity of self-report of SLE by comparing patient reported history of SLE with EHR documentation of this diagnosis.","Anticipated Findings
Male patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are described across multiple studies to often develop more severe disease. Patients with SLE in the United among specific racial groups, including black and Hispanic patients, have also been described to develop more severe disease. These are attributed to a combination of genetic variance in the underlying disease and to social and environmental factors. Therefore, we anticipate men may have more frequent organ specific disease manifestations than women with SLE. Cardiovascular events are more common in men so we anticipate a higher rate of events in men with SLE. There is limited data on whether serologic positivity important to SLE is more prevalent among men than women so this prediction is less clear. This will be valuable as there is limited data characterizing SLE in men in a large cohort, or in characterizing the barriers to healthcare access among patients with SLE, which are potential targets for care improvement.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It is unclear if traditional clinical risk scores can adequately quantify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in underrepresented study populations. Additionally, the genetic determinants of risk factors for atherosclerotic risk disease, such as polygenic risk scores and monogenic mutations, have only been well-studied and in European populations.
Questions:
1. How does the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk differ between commonly represented and underrepresented populations?
2. Do traditional clinical risk scores for atherosclerotic cardiovascular perform similarly in diverse populations? If not, can this be addressed with new or modified clinical risk scores?
3. Can we develop polygenic risk scores for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and related risk factors for diverse populations?
4. What is the prevalence of genetic cardiovascular disorders in the population? Are there disparities in the recognition of these disorders between populations?","Project Purpose(s)

1. Prospective cohort analyses for incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular with subgroup analyses for distinct populations. Cox-proportional hazard models will be used for time-to-event analyses and logistic regression will be used for case-control status. Models will be adjusted for covariates such as age, sex,
2. Comparison of observed versus predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk using clinical risk tools such as the Pooled Cohort Equations, QRISK3, and the modified Framingham risk score.

Social, Structural, and Environmental Determinants of Health (SSEDOH) influence cardiovascular health in the general population; however, the degree to which this occurs among historically underrepresented individuals is not well described. The purpose of this study is to compare cardiometabolic health (cardiometabolic disease and risks) among the All of Us Program cohort by intersectional identity. We will also compare group-level associations among social, structural, and/or built environmental characteristics and cardiometabolic health and risks.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
A quantitative descriptive approach will be used to characterize ZIP3-level area deprivation and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors among the individuals in the study. Bivariate correlations, multivariable linear, and logistic regression models will be used to examine the relationships among area deprivation indices and cardiometabolic risk factors. We will also include physical activity with the covariates age, sex assigned at birth, sexuality, gender identity, and race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, health insurance status.  We will use logistic regression to determine the odds of hypertension, overweight and obesity , dyslipidemia, poor glycemia control, and also a CMD risk burden score. To assess exposure in the logistic regression model, overall ZIP3-level area deprivation will be dichotomized into two groups. Statistical significance will be set at p <.05. ZIP3-level area deprivation includes both the single factor and Berg 3-Factor area deprivation indices.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate there will be cardiometabolic health disparities (higher disease and higher risk) among sexual minority and gender diverse individuals, individuals from lower socioeconomic positions, historically marginalized populations (e.g. race, ethnicity, uninsured). Those living in areas with greater area deprivation measures will have higher odds of cardiometabolic disease and more risk factors.
Deprivation characteristics may serve to inform novel approaches to improve cardiometabolic health in diverse individuals. The high proportion of an increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiometabolic sequela make these types of social/environmental factors important targets for potentially reducing the disparities. Key stakeholders and policymakers should consider the characteristics of the areas in which people live as well as the characteristics of the people who live in those areas when developing policy and system-level interventional programs.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our study will look at how cardiovascular disease comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors differ by sex in those who are COVID-19 positive versus negative. This question is important because there is a lack of public knowledge on the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular health and how this may differ between men and women. Therefore, we are interested in analyzing prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors according to COVID-19 test positivity.  Since there are some sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes, we wish to examine how comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors may differ between men and women.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (COVID-19, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure)","Scientific Approaches
We will use the cohort builder to find participants who tested positive for COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria will include cardiovascular risk factors, behaviors and comorbidities. Our exclusion criteria will include people who tested negative for COVID-19. We will then create a second cohort of participants who have tested negative for COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria will remain the same as the first cohort, but this time the exclusion criteria will include people who tested positive for COVID-19. We will also stratify our cohorts into male versus female. After, we will create a dataset builder, and generate concept sets on cardiovascular risk factors (eg hypertension, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), behaviors (diet, smoking, physical activity), and comorbidities (prior history of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, COPD, diabetes). We will then import the data to Jupyter Notebook and write code in R to analyze our data.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study are that males who tested positive for COVID-19 will have the most cardiovascular risk factors, followed by males who tested negative for COVID-19, females who tested positive for COVID-19, and lastly, females who tested negative for COVID-19. We expect that males who tested positive for COVID-19 will be more likely to have hypertension, diabetes and less physical activity compared to females.

Both incidence & mortality of prostate cancer are significantly higher in patients who identify as black as compared to other race groups (Odedina et al 2009). This dataset provides access to data encompassing SDOH that would allow for a more comprehensive look into how SDOH play into outcome disparities in the population.
We are interested in investigating the relationship between SDOH and 1. Cardiovascular disease end points including but not limited to stroke, MI, and hospitalization for HF.  2. Mortality
This analysis will enhance understanding of how different demographics are affected by prostate cancer. Understanding how factors such as education, access to healthcare, amongst other SDOH may play into both cardiovascular outcomes and mortality could potentially help shape treatment plans that are better catered to the specific needs of specific patient populations. This would be particularly helpful for patients that come from historically underserved populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (prostate cancer, Cardiovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Population: Our population of interest is prostate cancer patients in the US.
Outcome: We want to investigate mortality and cardiovascular disease as outcomes.
Exposure: SDOH such as education, economic measures (income for example), physical infrastructure, access to healthcare, and other relevant determinants
Covariates: race, age, location, BMI, smoking history, alcohol use, comorbidities (such as diabetes, hypertension etc), occupation, lifestyle habits (sedentary, active etc)
Analysis: We plan to use longitudinal data analysis to investigate the outcomes listed above. We will control for the covariates listed and see how outcomes differ based on the exposures of SDOH and treatment types. We will separate our analysis for the two sets of outcomes: cardiovascular disease, as well as cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.","Anticipated Findings
Studies have been conducted to investigate relationships between specific SDOHs and mortality, particularly to try and understand the large racial disparity in outcomes. Some have shown that low-income may lead to higher mortality rates (Tewari et al 2009). Furthermore, over time as changes in screening recommendations and interventions have been complemented, there has been in a decrease in risk associated with prostate cancer (Cooperberg et al 2003). In regards to our interest in CVD, studies have shown a similar relationship between lower income and CVD incidence (Kreatsoulas and Anand 2010). Through our analysis, we will evaluate this association in men with prostate cancer population. We anticipate that analysis using the comprehensive All of Us data will provide further insight into how the different SDOHs and treatment types impact outcome, in particular since we would be able to analyze multiple social determinants simultaneously, unlike in prior papers.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Second, which genes are uniquely responsible for driving vascular disease and/or aneurysmal disease in the peripheral vascular bed and not in other vascular territories? Third, will a set of genotypes allow us to predict who will be at highest risk for severe vascular disease, including chronic limb threatening ischemia? While substantial work has been performed in establishing the genetic determinants of vascular diseases, including PAD, coronary disease, carotid disease, and aortic aneurysm (abdominal and thoracic), disentangling the genes that specifically affect one disease process or another (or, one vascular bed or another) remains elusive. We intend to us the All of Us resource to answer these key questions, as outlined below.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (vascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The last decade of genetic association analysis has demonstrated that the effects of common DNA sequence variants are modest (each individual mutation identified increases disease risk by ~2-20%) and thus, large sample sizes will be necessary to fully elucidate the spectrum of common vascular disease mutations within the population.  We intend to leverage the following methods for genomic analysis:
1) Discovery Genome-wide Association Study analysis in the common variant space
2) Explore the phenotype consequences of vascular disease risk variants
3) To associate predicted loss-of-function variation with vascular disease leveraging whole genome sequencing data
4) Bayesian tools to combine genomic data with publicly available gene-expression data to identify potential therapeutic targets (ie, colocalization analyses with data from repositories like GTEx)
5) Bayesian tools to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for genomic risk prediction, including for disease progression","Anticipated Findings
We believe our findings will contribute to the body of scientific literature through the identification of:
1) Novel genes and variants associated with vascular disease
2) Genes and variants that target one specific type of vascular disease over another
3) Genes and variants that target one vascular bed over another
4) The spectrum of consequences for disease-associated variants
5) Individuals at the highest risk of progressive disease through genomic risk prediction
In each of these cases, the above data can be used to prioritize causal genes and pathways for novel treatments. Through the discovery of vascular disease-associated genes and describing the range of effects of disease-associated variants, we aim to elucidate key insights of biologic and pharmacologic potential. We hope that the identification of such risk factors, cell types, and genes may be used to inform clinical care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations.

We will use the All of US dataset V5. We will identify variables that represent (1) structural heart disease (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, tricuspid stenosis); (2) all the known risk factors for each of these conditions; (3) physiological variables that are associated with risk of structural heart disease (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A1C); (4) anatomical variables that are associated with risk of structural heart disease (chamber size and function, valve morphology and severity, and effect on pulmonary and systemic circulation); and (5) identify the minority groups of interest.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the world and also in the United States.  Screening asymptomatic patients at high risk for CHD is essential in preventing morbidity and mortality related to ASCVD. The traditional risk factor assessment tools fall short in identifying intermediate risk patients. More biomarkers are therefore needed to improve risk stratification in this risk category. The role of iron-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of CVD has been demonstrated in several animal models its role in humans is still controversial partly because of the use of iron metrics that are strongly influenced not only by systemic and tissue iron burden but also by inflammation and also the cross-sectional nature of the past studies . We propose to improve on previous analyses by focusing on a better characterized cohort derived from a large longitudinal epidemiological study together with applying more sophisticated statistical analysis.","Project Purpose(s)

If suitable data are available, subsequent research would apply genome-wide genetic methods to identify specific loci (i.e. genetic variants) that contribute to the risk of one or more of the disorders listed in section 2.1.  Through computational methods leveraging public data related to tissue-specific gene expression and biology , identification of these loci would, in turn, help identify individual genes, and further, biological pathways and tissues that are relevant to unique or shared pathophysiology.  The All of Us data for these analyses would include basic demographic information, medical history of the disorders from questionnaire information and medical records, and whole genome genetic data.  Genetic analysis would be performed within strata of genetically derived ancestry, and then compared across ancestry strata.","Anticipated Findings

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

With few exceptions (e.g., Nicoloro, Lobel & Wolfe, 2016), mast cell disorders have received little attention from psychological science. Therefore, reliable estimates of the prevalence of emotional distress in this population are largely nonexistent. Documenting levels, types, and contributors to depression in this population can facilitate the development of appropriate interventions and highlight pathways through which emotional states such as depression may exacerbate mast cell disorders, as hypothesized by some researchers (Theoharides & Konstantinidou, 2007). There is considerable evidence in other populations that negative emotional states can influence physical health through a variety of pathways; a number of these are implicated in mast cell disorders, including the immune, endocrine, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems(e.g., Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002; Herbert & Cohen, 1993; Kiecolt-Glaser, Malarkey, Cacioppo, & Glaser, 1994).","Project Purpose(s)

Childhood obesity is a major public health problem across the globe as well as in the US. Childhood obesity can continue into adulthood and is known to be a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases . Preventing childhood obesity has been actively pursued in pediatric programs. However, decades of rigorous research have shown that prevention and management of obesity is not easy.

Cardiovascular disease risk is an important determinant of how we treat patients. Preventive medications can reduce future risk, but they are associated with both financial and biological side-effects. Previous methods of predicting risk, notably the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), tend to perform worse in racial and ethnic minorities than in populations from European ancestry. As such, we plan to evaluate the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction in the diverse cohort of the All of Us study, and determine which if any variables might aid in refining risk in racial and ethnic minorities.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) includes stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), documented coronary artery disease (CAD) with stable angina, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), coronary or other arterial revascularization, peripheral vascular disease with or without claudication, and aortic aneurysm. In clinical practice, physicians will also include asymptomatic CAD (meaning, without angina)  with demonstrable ischemia on a stress test.
We plan to utilize data from adults greater than 18 years of age in the All of Us Research study who are free of ASCVD, and have complete data for inputs in the Pooled Cohort Equation (age, gender, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure (BP), BP medications, diabetes status, and smoking status).
We propose to then use the PCE to assess accuracy of risk prediction in the multi-ethnic All of Us cohort.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are that the PCE will not perform equally across all racial and ethnic categories. This will provide an opportunity for further refinement of risk-prediction algorithms using commonly collected clinical information.

We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest
