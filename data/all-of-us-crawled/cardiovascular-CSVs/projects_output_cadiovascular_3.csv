I will be exploring the data to determine if it will allow me to examine health disparities in sleep health during pregnancy/postpartum. Health disparities exist in sleep health, with individuals of racial/ethnic minorities or low SES known to have shorter, more disrupted sleep. My goal is to examine if those sleep problems are associated with pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and cardiovascular risk, among others.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
I plan to examine sleep variables (such as insomnia disorder, FitBit sleep data, etc.) as moderators for diagnoses related to pregnancy in individuals of underrepresented groups.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that sleep disorders increase the risk for pregnancy complications and that this relationship will be increased for individuals of minority race/ethnicity status, low SES, and other known risk factors. These findings will help us to identify targets for behavioral sleep interventions during pregnancy/postpartum.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are exploring the AllofUS data for correlations between Fitbit data (specifically, heart rate and steps) and cardiovascular outcomes. The initial question we pose is: Can Fitbit HR/step data and appropriate scaling of HR with activity be used as a predictor of CV disease and its complications? Participants will be grouped based on their HR at certain activity levels and whether HR is appropriately scaling with activity (i.e. low HR, low step count; low HR, high step count; high HR, low step count, etc.). Using EHR data, we plan to analyze which of these groups are at greatest risk for CV outcomes (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular hospitalization, death, etc.). Should this data be a predictor of the health outcomes described, this project may validate wearable technology's clinical utility in predicting/assessing CV disease. This will also answer a novel question regarding the appropriate scaling of HR with activity and its importance in cardiovascular health.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
To answer the question above, we plan to explore the Fitbit data, demographic data, and EHR data (including diagnoses, medications, hospitalizations, etc.) available in the AllofUS dataset to find associations with activity/HR and cardiovascular disease. Fitbit HR and step data will be linked, and participants' HR over various activity levels will be used to group them based on whether their HR is appropriately adjusting with activity level. Cardiovascular disease among these groups will then be compared. The availability/granularity of this data will ultimately determine the methods used to answer our question.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that certain groups from those above will be at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and complications from it. Specifically, we suspect that those who have inappropriately high HR without much activity, or those who have inappropriately low HR are at greater risk than those whose HR appropriately adjusts with activity. While other studies may have shown this, or similar correlations, seldom use data as granular as is possible with wearable fitness trackers. With these devices, minute-by-minute data is available for both steps and HR over the course of months to years. No other studies have used data this granular in examining appropriate HR rise/fall in response to activity and how this correlates with cardiovascular disease. In addition, very few studies have verified the clinical utility of data that is tracked by wearables.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Dupe2 of Detection of Gene-Environment Interactions for Complex Diseases (v7),"Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors.

Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Neither genomics or environmental factors alone are sufficient for complete understanding of complex diseases, or adequately address health conditions or inequalities in health. All of Us with rich and high-quality data on genomics and environmental exposures provide opportunities to understand the interactions between genes and environment on health. Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.  Song and Zhang (2014) developed tree-based analysis of rare variants (TARV) to construct super-variants which combine genetic markers in any loci. With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find novel gene-environment interactions for complex diseases, and some examples of their implications/contributions include:
• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations. Using the measures of discrimination and/or racism in All of US, we can assess not only how the race may affect genetic-health associations, but also the role of racism, and broadly, the culture and social environments.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Lupus is an autoimmune disease when the body's immune system attacks its tissues and organs, causing widespread inflammation - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus became a global pandemic, and while there were many named co-morbidities- such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer, however, there was very little information about the association of COVID-19 and Lupus. Vaccines are well-studied medications to reduce and have even eliminated many diseases in the national population. As Lupus is an autoimmune disease, most medical professionals encourage their patients to get at least one of the available vaccines. Still, many African Americans, even those without Lupus, hesitated to get a vaccine. This study looks at the impact of Covid-19 infections on those diagnosed with Lupus and attitudes surrounding available vaccines.","Project Purpose(s)

The timing of cardiovascular changes in pregnancy  is important, as mistiming of these changes may represent underlying cardiac maladaptation to pregnancy (Ling et al., 2019).

The most common cause of death among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased cardiovascular risk in patients with SLE appears to be multifactorial. Traditional risk factors (such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and the inflammatory process intrinsic to SLE seem to contribute to the occurrence of arterial vascular events. Previous studies have performed cardiovascular risk stratification; however, the association by different ethnicities/races has not been evaluated.  We will use existing databases (OCHIN and local data) to generate harmonized datasets categorized by ethnicity to accomplish this. These datasets will be employed to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify combinations of factors (features) linked to CVD risk in patients with SLE among various ethnic groups, specifically for Caribbean Hispanics.","Project Purpose(s)

These functions will be implemented in Python, utilizing Dataframe and other relevant libraries. We will harmonize multiple datasets organized by race/ethnicity.

As a result, a list of factors (features) most relevant to CVD risk in SLE patients for each ethnicity/race group (including Caribbean Hispanics) will be obtained.  (To be completed by Q2 of the year)
In addition, several ML algorithms will be trained (i.e., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, others) to create models for predicting CVD risks in SLE patients grouped by ethnicity/race.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diseases of the heart and blood vessels, account for approximately 18 million deaths worldwide. Most genetic studies have disproportionately used individuals of European ancestry, leaving minority populations under-investigated. The increased availability of hyper-palatable foods, including foods rich in fat and sugar, is associated with the rapid rise in obesity, dyslipidemia, and CVD.  The present study attempts to 1) elucidate the potential dynamic biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to dyslipidemia and cardiometabolic diseases by combining genomics, exome, metabolomics, and phenome data and 2) identify if the dynamic biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to dyslipidemia are associated with taste-related genes and neural correlates of food preferences from neuroimaging data.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Demographic and covariate variables will include age, sex, race, education level, income, alcohol use, health history, physical activity, and smoking status. Health-related data will include anthropometric and adipometric data, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP in mm Hg), fasting glucose, insulin, weight, height, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). We will use diet, metabolomic profiles from serum samples, genetic data, and imaging data from large population studies. Linear/logistic regression models will be built to assess the gene-environment interactions.
According to Genet Epidemiol: 201-210, to detect an interaction effect size of 2.0 with 80% power, ~2500 samples (N1=N2=2500) are needed. When the interaction effect size is increased to 3.0, ~1800 samples are needed. However, larger sample sizes will allow higher power, which are desirable.","Anticipated Findings
Cardiovascular diseases are associated with disparities in morbidity and mortality rates. Precise screening tools for early detection of at-risk individuals is a priority in public health to address health disparities among individuals from diverse genetic ancestry populations. Considering that cardiovascular diseases have genetic components and associated clinical symptoms, the proposed study aims to elucidate gene-environment interactions contributing to dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases through genetic association analyses. The ultimate goal is to evaluate the possibility of developing predictive models to identify and characterize affected and at-risk individuals from diverse population ancestry.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Can mutations in PTC impact food preferences and lead to hypertensive disorders/hypertension? PTC, also known as phenylthiocarbamide, is a tasting phenotype that has been known to vary amongst human populations. PTC is associated with the ability to taste bitter substances, which has been a genetic, epidemiological, and evolutionary interest to many (Wooding et al., 2004). Since this phenotype varies from person to person, the presence in PTC reflects dietary preference. Per Wooding, PTC perception is capable of revealing the correlation to diet-related disease susceptibility in modern populations (2004). In which case, mutations in the PTC may contribute to the dietary risk factors of hypertension. Thus, the choices individuals with the SNPs that allow for tasting bitterness make about their diet have long term and cumulative effects on their health, specifically forms of cardiovascular disease like hypertension.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (blood pressure)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Criteria for the patient cohort includes those who have been diagnosed with hypertension. Possible inclusions are individuals with obesity over a reasonable number of pounds pertaining to average weight for a corresponding age range. Trends must be selected for the patient age range as cardiovascular decline is expected in older patients. In addition, a search criteria will be refined to individuals with ""tasting and non-tasting'' PTC mutations. Specifically regions on the TAS2R gene on chromosome 7q that codes for bitter taste receptors (Kim et. al, 2003). Search criteria may be refined to identify single polymorphism nucleotides (SNP) as well as mutations in base pairs that code for tasting and non-tasting respectively. Further research will be conducted to isolate specific base pairs. Several sets of data are necessary to plot statistical analysis of each patient.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that those with mutations in the PTC gene receptor that cause sensitivity to bitter taste, specifically tasters, will be at higher risk for develop hypertensive disorders due to their dietary preferences.

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Datasets: Fitbit accelerometry data; data regarding diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, blood glucose metrics, cholesterol metrics, and blood pressure.

Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Neither genomics or environmental factors alone are sufficient for complete understanding of complex diseases, or adequately address health conditions or inequalities in health. All of Us with rich and high-quality data on genomics and environmental exposures provide opportunities to understand the interactions between genes and environment on health. Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.  Song and Zhang (2014) developed tree-based analysis of rare variants (TARV) to construct super-variants which combine genetic markers in any loci. With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find novel gene-environment interactions for complex diseases, and some examples of their implications/contributions include:
• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations. Using the measures of discrimination and/or racism in All of US, we can assess not only how the race may affect genetic-health associations, but also the role of racism, and broadly, the culture and social environments.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A quantitative descriptive approach will be used to characterize ZIP3-level area deprivation and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors among the individuals in the study. Bivariate correlations, multivariable linear, and logistic regression models will be used to examine the relationships among area deprivation indices and cardiometabolic risk factors. We will also include physical activity with the covariates age, sex assigned at birth, sexuality, gender identity, and race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, health insurance status.  We will use logistic regression to determine the odds of hypertension, overweight and obesity , dyslipidemia, poor glycemia control, and also a CMD risk burden score. To assess exposure in the logistic regression model, overall ZIP3-level area deprivation will be dichotomized into two groups. Statistical significance will be set at p <.05. ZIP3-level area deprivation includes both the single factor and Berg 3-Factor area deprivation indices.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate there will be cardiometabolic health disparities (higher disease and higher risk) among sexual minority and gender diverse individuals, individuals from lower socioeconomic positions, historically marginalized populations (e.g. race, ethnicity, uninsured). Those living in areas with greater area deprivation measures will have higher odds of cardiometabolic disease and more risk factors.
Deprivation characteristics may serve to inform novel approaches to improve cardiometabolic health in diverse individuals. The high proportion of an increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiometabolic sequela make these types of social/environmental factors important targets for potentially reducing the disparities. Key stakeholders and policymakers should consider the characteristics of the areas in which people live as well as the characteristics of the people who live in those areas when developing policy and system-level interventional programs.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This also includes demographic characteristics of participants such as age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race. Survey measurement data will also be included such as depressive symptoms, and discrimination. Covariates of cardiovascular disease will also be investigated such as familial history of a heart disease, tobacco use, alcohol use frequency, and other substance use. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured through the Fitbit data available and will be treated appropriately with established methods. HRV will be explored through multiple measures such as resting heart rate (interbeat interval), differences between heartbeats, low-frequency (LF) power, and high-frequency (HF) power.
Researchers will investigate trajectories with a longitudinal perspective.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that SGM of color will have faster decreasing trajectories of HRV and physical activity compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Additionally, we predict that decreasing trajectories of physical activity will be associated with poorer trajectories of cardiometabolic health, with associations pronounced for SGM of color compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Lastly, we hypothesize that greater exposure to discrimination will be associated with decreased physical activity which results in lower HRV among SGM, especially those of color.
The findings of this study will contribute to the current emerging field of sexual and gender minority health. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and this effect is more pronounced for individuals in possession of a minority identity. Findings will provide an additional look into how discrimination affects CVD risk among racial and ethnic groups of SGM.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Socioeconomic factors are key contributors to disproportionate outcomes in cardiovascular health, especially premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); however, the mechanisms underlying such trends are ill-defined. Given that [lipoprotein(a)] Lp(a) is an important risk factor for premature ASCVD, targeted screening can be an especially useful approach to guide earlier risk assessment and reduction of ASCVD risk. Whether demographics or socioeconomic status are associated with Lp(a) testing and thereby important barriers to overcome for implementing equitable hypercholesterolemia screening is unknown. The All of US Research program provides an ideal setting to study the association of socioeconomic factors with Lp(a) testing in a real-world setting and given that 75% of All of US research program participants are derived from underrepresented populations in biomedical research.","Project Purpose(s)

Background: Patients with prostate cancer (PC) face an elevated risk of both developing and dying from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Given the unique characteristics of this population, the American College of Cardiology Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for ASCVD predictions may lack accuracy.
Methods: Males ≥18 years, diagnosed with PC between 2005-2012 at a hybrid academic-community practice (Northeast Ohio, US) were included. Using XGBoost algorithm we developed using a training subset of the cohort (50% train + 25% test), ranked 33 covariates (including demographic, treatment-related and social determinants of health (SDOH) information) for ASCVD prediction using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The top 10 predictors were transformed in a predictive equation using logistic regression models. This equation was tested in the cohort validation subset (25%), and subsequently compared to the PCE risk score.","Project Purpose(s)

Results: We included 1,506 patients without prior ASCVD , with a median age of 67 (interquartile range 60-74) years, 13.8% had advanced stage disease (TNM III-IV), 1.5% had high risk PC (Gleason 8-10), and 20.5% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Of those, 10.4% had a 10-year ASCVD risk. The PCE had an area under the curve (AUC)=0.61 and underestimated ASCVD in 0.9% (mean risk=20.1% [95% CI 17.2-23.0] vs. mean predicted risk=19.2% [95% CI 18.6-19.8]).  The equation pooled from the top-10 predictors of the ML algorithm (C-index=0.78 [95% CI 0.75-0.81]) achieved an AUC=0.71.
Conclusions: Conventional ASCVD risk scores tend to underestimate the risk in males with PC. A cancer-specific model inclusive of SDOH exhibited good performance and generated a user-friendly equation for predicting ASCVD risk in this population.

Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Neither genomics or environmental factors alone are sufficient for complete understanding of complex diseases, or adequately address health conditions or inequalities in health. All of Us with rich and high-quality data on genomics and environmental exposures provide opportunities to understand the interactions between genes and environment on health. Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.  Song and Zhang (2014) developed tree-based analysis of rare variants (TARV) to construct super-variants which combine genetic markers in any loci. With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find novel gene-environment interactions for complex diseases, and some examples of their implications/contributions include:
• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations. Using the measures of discrimination and/or racism in All of US, we can assess not only how the race may affect genetic-health associations, but also the role of racism, and broadly, the culture and social environments.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Preeclampsia in women in multiple studies has shown association with aging and aging-related diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular disease later in life. Since this is a discreet event that often happens to women relatively early in their life it provides an opportunity to both better understand the mechanism of preeclampsia and these aging pathways, as well as, a broader understanding of how discrete events can lead to differences in aging over decades.

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression.

Gout is an inflammatory metabolic disease affecting > 4% of US adults, including > 9% of those over age 65.  People with gout can experience very painful and disabling attacks (flares) in their joints and are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.
Gout results from high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricaemia) and studies by our group and others have identified many environmental, clinical, and genetic factors associated with gout. These include diuretic medications (increased risk), and coffee and vitamin C (decreased risk).  However, despite evidence that gout is having a greater impact on men and women in non-White racial groups in the US, most factors were identified in people of self-reported White race.
To address these gaps, we are exploring the AllofUs data to plan future studies on the environmental, genetic, and clinical factors associated with gout (or worse gout outcomes) in women and men of different racial/ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate using the EHR data and self-reported survey data to classify participants’ gout status and uric acid levels.

We anticipate using logistic regression models to evaluate the association between exposures and the risk of gout or hyperuricemia, adjusting for well-established gout risk factors such as overweight/obesity and use of diuretic medications.  We will also assess for joint effects and interactions between exposures, including genetic exposures drawn from the Genomics dataset.  For example, our prior analysis of a different cohort of mainly White adults found that excess BMI can exacerbate the impact of carrying certain hyperuricemia genes on the risk of gout.  Mediation analysis will be performed to quantify factors influencing sex- or racial differences in the burden of gout.","Anticipated Findings

Secondly,  understanding what the potential ""buffers"" are that mitigate the negative effects of PTSD on cardiovascular risk factors is critically important if we are going to create tailored interventions to reduce CVD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are using the All of Us Researcher Workbench interface to answer the question, ""Is hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program similar to hypertension prevalence in the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ?"". Clinical approaches to understanding and treating hypertension may benefit from the integration of a precision medicine approach that integrates data on environments, social determinants of health, behaviors, and genomic factors that contribute to hypertension risk. Hypertension is a major public health concern and remains a leading risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (This work is an AoU demo project. Demo projects are efforts by the AoU Research Program designed to meet the program goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. As an approved demo project, this work was reviewed and overseen by the AoU Research Program Science Committee and the AoU Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) has traditionally been viewed as a disease of men, new evidence suggests the existence of distinct differences in the risk factors, development, and outcomes between the two sexes.  For example, our recent studies have revealed that the genetic factors for several intermediate cardiometabolic traits, represent potentially novel sex-specific mechanisms for CVD. In addition to sexually dimorphic associations, we intend to build upon our research on variants specifically associated with myocardial infarction. This project proposes to build on our observations using genetic and clinical cardiometabolic phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (coronary artery disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
A series of analyses will be sex-stratified genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) for CVD-related binary traits in the full dataset.  For GWAS of discrete traits, we are interested in coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) as clinical outcomes. We will be using unbiased genetic analysis using whole genome sequencing data with statistical genetic analyses to uncover common and rare variants associated with discrete cardiometabolic clinical traits.","Anticipated Findings
Our previous studies have identified potentially novel sexually dimorphic mechanisms for the development of CVD. Although these results support the concept that the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease in women may differ from men, they also raise several important unanswered questions from a genetics perspective such as what are the mechanisms by which other loci in the genome influence plasma levels of metabolites and lipid species of interest and do they exhibit sexually dimorphic associations with CVD phenotypes?  Similarly, little is known about the genetic determinants that are specifically associated with MI among patients with CAD compared to those that drive atherogenesis. Although previous studies of ours have identified novel variants associated specifically with MI, we believe there are additional loci that are MI specific. Thus, identifying genes involved in the complex pathological processes leading to MI/plaque rupture could have important clinical implications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is characterized by misfolding of the tetrameric transthyretin protein complex that accumulates as extracellular amyloid fibrils and results in polyneuropathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias. We have previously demonstrated that carriers of a genetic variation in the TTR gene (rs76992529; Val122Ile), which is seen more commonly among individuals of African ancestry, have a higher risk of incident heart failure and mortality (heart failure mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality). However, not all carriers of this genetic variant develop heart failure. We seek to pursue the clinical characterization of TTR V122I carriers among the participants of the All Of US to ascertain their clinical characteristics and the impact of environmental factors on the risk of heart failure or mortality.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods:  We utilized the multi-ethnic pan-ancestry UK Biobank GWAS data (available at:https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org) for systolic and diastolic BP as the base data for the computation of the PRS (SNPs and their associated β-coefficients). The BP PRS will be constructed using the PRS-CS approach. The PRS-CS is a Bayesian approach to computing PRS that derives each genetic variant’s posterior mean effect size (weight) from the prior GWAS base data while accounting for the LD using the 1000 Genomes as the reference population. We will use the ϕ values set to 10^-2, 10^-4, 10^-6, and auto, with a p-value threshold of 0.05. Unlike other Bayesian methods such as LDPred, PRS-CS-auto does not require separate derivation and validation subcohorts.
Tools: Plink 2.0; R Statistical Software;","Anticipated Findings
In this comprehensive investigation involving a multi-ethnic cohort of American adults, we anticipate finding a robust cross-sectional association of multi-ethnic BP PRS (polygenic risk score) with BP traits overall and across subgroups of self-identified race/ethnicity was observed.
Second, we anticipate that individuals at an increased genetic risk for elevated BP (measured using BP PRS) are also predisposed individuals to an increased risk of adverse CV events such as heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), or stroke, after accounting for traditional CV risk factors (ACC/AHA Pooled Cohorts Equation [PCE]).
Third, we anticipate that among those with a high genetic predisposition to elevated BP, a low traditional CV risk factor burden (low ACC/AHA PCE risk) will be associated with a lower risk of adverse CV events.
Lastly, in a multi-ethnic cohort of middle-aged adults, BP PRS will provide a modest improvement in adverse CV risk prediction beyond the ACC/AHA PCE.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The objectives of this study are to assess trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) and trajectories of physical activity separately among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) of color, heterosexuals of color, in comparison to White sexual and gender minorities, as well as White heterosexuals.
A secondary aim of this study is to assess how trajectories of physical activity are associated with changes in HRV among SGM and heterosexuals of color. SGM are shown to have higher rates of harmful cardiometabolic health behaviors when compared to cisgender heterosexuals.
The final aim of this study is to cross-sectionally investigate if physical activity mediates the association between discrimination and HRV among SGM and heterosexuals. Exposure to discrimination may lead to increased cardiovascular risk through behavioral and physiological pathways such as unhealthy coping behaviors or blunted diurnal cortisol slopes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The present study plans to utilize most of the data available through All of Us which contains electronic health records, biological specimen measurements, and Fitbit measurements. This also includes demographic characteristics of participants such as age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race. Survey measurement data will also be included such as depressive symptoms, and discrimination. Covariates of cardiovascular disease will also be investigated such as familial history of a heart disease, tobacco use, alcohol use frequency, and other substance use. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured through the Fitbit data available and will be treated appropriately with established methods. HRV will be explored through multiple measures such as resting heart rate (interbeat interval), differences between heartbeats, low-frequency (LF) power, and high-frequency (HF) power.
Researchers will investigate trajectories with a longitudinal perspective.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that SGM of color will have faster decreasing trajectories of HRV and physical activity compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Additionally, we predict that decreasing trajectories of physical activity will be associated with poorer trajectories of cardiometabolic health, with associations pronounced for SGM of color compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Lastly, we hypothesize that greater exposure to discrimination will be associated with decreased physical activity which results in lower HRV among SGM, especially those of color.
The findings of this study will contribute to the current emerging field of sexual and gender minority health. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and this effect is more pronounced for individuals in possession of a minority identity. Findings will provide an additional look into how discrimination affects CVD risk among racial and ethnic groups of SGM.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This will help the program quantify the importance of collecting further longitudinal data for existing and future participants.

For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity and importance of the data collected by the program and can be challenging to extract from medical records (smoking status) by showing by calculating the cardiovascular risk within 10 years. We expect to find: 1) the easiness in using data from different sources (EHR and survey data) to build a model or calculate a risk. 2) the heterogeneity in All of Us population where underrepresented population in clinical trials or clinical data set are more present in the All of Us  3) the cardiovascular risk score is different in racial groups.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by lifelong elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and dramatically increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genetic studies now suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) encompasses five discrete subtypes based on LDL-c levels, 1) a monogenic FH variant, 2) a high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) polygenic score, 3) elevated lipoprotein(a), 4) elevated LDL-c polygenic score with elevated lipoprotein(a), and 5) a positive family history without an identifiable genetic cause, or true “phenotypic FH.” The primary question of this project is: Are there differences in treatment, comorbidities, and ASCVD outcomes between FH subtypes?","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to screen all individuals with whole genome sequences available for monogenic variants in an FH gene. We will calculate an LDL cholesterol polygenic risk score from each participant’s whole genome sequence. Using labs and measurements, we will identify individuals with an FH subtype.

Sexual and Gender Minorities (SGM), SGM of color in particular, have heightened rates of cardiovascular disease. However, it is not clear how cardiovascular disease risk changes over time.

We have evidence to suggest that there is an association between inflammation and cardiovascular disease health. However, less is known about how social determinate of health, such as features of the built environment (e.g. neighborhood safety, urban vs. rural, etc.) are associated with cardiovascular health through inflammation. Moreover, it is unclear how these mechanistic pathways from social determinates of health, through inflammation, to cardiovascular disease risk vary by key sociodemographic features like race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. Thus, the following investigation 2 has research questions.
1. Are environmental features (e.g. housing instability, neighborhood features, etc.) associated with physiological deregulation as measured by inflammation (e.g. cytokines, Interleukin’s, and c-reactive protein, biological markers of inflammation) and thus cardiovascular disease risk?

Does higher visit-to-visit blood pressure predict risk of future cardiovascular diseases?
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and  mortality for the developed countries.
Elevated blood pressure is one of the well-established CVD risk factors.
Few population studies showed statistical associations between blood pressure variation and risk of future CVD.
However, the potential association has not been supported for all studies.
Accordingly, we propose to characterize distributions of blood pressure variations and potential association with CVD risks using the all of us resources.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular diseases)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
To characterize visit to visit variation of blood pressure, at least three blood pressure (BP) measurements at different time periods are required.
Therefore, we plan to acquire electric medical record files and capture participants with at least two  BP measurements those who also have physical measurement at study baseline.    We will identify BP-related information through the electric medical records and medication record files.
We will applied available R code for proportional hazard models.   The analysis models will treat CVD diagnosis of death as the outcome variable while BP variability will be the independent variable.   The regression models will include covariates: age,sex, total and HDL-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, BMI, cigarette smoking, as well as mean BP, and BP slope across all BP  time periods.
In the multi-variable regression model for mortality events, we adjusted CVD risk factors and diagnosis of CVD.","Anticipated Findings

This study will examine differences in demographic and clinical risk factor profiles of patients with cardiovascular disease (ischemic heart disease and stroke) across different All of Us survey subcohorts. Cardiovascular disease will be defined based on ICD9/10 codes from the EHR. We will compare participants who did and did not respond to the medical history survey. Specific questions we will ask:
1. What is the prevalence of CVD (IHD, and stroke) among participants who did and did not respond to the personal medical history questionnaire.
2. Does the demographic and socioeconomic profile of patients with IHD or stroke vary by whether or not they responded to the personal medical history questionnaire?

We will restrict our analysis to participants with EHR data who answered the baseline basic questionnaire. We will use R statistical programing language to calculate descriptive and multivariable regression models. Prevalence estimates with corresponding 95% CIs of the prevalence of CVD conditions, and demographic and clinical factors across AoU subcohorts will be calculated and compared with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression models will be estimated to identify factors associated with completing the personal medical history file among patients with IHD or stroke separately.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the prevalence of stroke and IHD will be lower among participants who responded to the personal medical history questionnairewith EHR release than among participants who responded to the basic survey with EHR release alone. Moreover, we hypothesize that patients with IHD or stroke who filled out the personal medical history questionnaire with EHR release will have a higher proportion of White participants, be of higher socioeconomic status and will have a lower vascular risk factor burden than those who did not fill out the questionnaire.
This study will provide important information regarding potential limitations to the generalizability of data in All of  Us across various subcohorts based on responses to different questionnaires.

We intend to study somatic evolution in the blood as evidenced by the presence or absence of driver mutations and the rate at which specific mutations expand over time (on average). We will then correlate these data with the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. The extent to which this will be possible depends on the sequencing depth of the dataset. However, if we can perform this research, it will be relevant to understanding how cardiovascular disease evolves.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to model our methods on those published in Heyde et al., “Increased stem cell proliferation in atherosclerosis accelerates clonal hematopoiesis” (Cell 2021). We will use somatic variants in whole genome sequencing data and mathematical modeling to study the behavior of hematopoietic clones and link these results to clinical variables within the All of Us dataset. However, our approach depends on the sequencing depth and clinical variables that are accessible through All of Us, so a more specific description of the planned approaches will only be possible once we have studied the details of the data set.","Anticipated Findings
It is difficult to anticipate the study results without knowing more specifics about the available data, but we expect that our findings will contribute to our understanding of the interconnections between hematopoietic somatic evolution and cardiovascular disease. As such, this research is of a broad public health relevance.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The aim of this study is to conduct a large-scale phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to explore the relationships between genetic variants in genes related to mitochondrial fission and fusion and a wide range of human disease phenotypes.
Mitochondria are important cellular structures that undergo processes like fission, fusion, and movement. Dysfunctions in these processes have been associated with various diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and aging. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies in large populations that investigate the associations between genetic variants in mitochondrial fission and fusion genes and different disease outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing combinations of genetic variants in these genes to better understand disease associations and gain insights into underlying mechanisms.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Mitochondrial fission and fusion related diseases)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To study the effects of functional rare coding variants in mitochondrial fission and fusion genes, we will use a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) approach. PheWAS involves association tests over the human phenome using HER-derived medical conditions from All of Us research dataset. Additionally, we will adopt a pathway-centric approach that leverages biological pathway information to analyze these genes collectively, as traditional rare variant analysis may be underpowered. We will map ICD representations of diseases to PheCodes and use Jupyter Notebook to create reusable functions for PheWAS and generate Manhattan Plots summarizing associations. This research aims to identify genetic causes of diseases and advance our understanding of mitochondrial dynamic in human health.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate that we will be able to validate some known disease associations with dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion pathways. It is important to note that the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and diseases is multifaceted. While there is evidence implicating dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion in various diseases, the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate the genetic evidence in humans to unravel the complex molecular pathways in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and their potential roles in the pathogenesis of diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Noncoding regulatory elements, such as enhancers, act as regulators of gene expression. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project and other studies have identified millions of regulatory elements in various tissues. The roles of noncoding regulatory elements in many human diseases have acquired considerable attention, including in cancer, cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disorders. GWAS studies in understanding the genetic basis of these diseases has also identified many noncoding regulatory variants responsible for genetic risk, yet the mechanisms behind these risk variants remain poorly understood. Recent integrating multidimensional genomic data, such as expression, methylation, histone modification, chromatin accessibility and three-dimensional organization data, have enhanced interpretation of noncoding risk variants in human diseases.  However, systematic analysis multidimensional genomic data make things more complex and has become a big challenge in the field.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we will develop novel and powerful computational methods to systematically discover the potential biomarker and drug target in human diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, asthma, T2D, and many other metabolism diseases based on multidimensional genomic data. We first will identify molecular differences between healthy individuals and patients based on these sequencing data. The All of Us project provides a great resource of genomic data in well-phenotype, disease-relevant populations. We will identify differences between healthy individuals and patients based on All of Us sequencing data. And then using newly developed computational methods to systematically integrate multidimensional genomic data from other cohorts.","Anticipated Findings
In this study, we will develop novel computational methods to systematically discover these diseases causing changes in noncoding elements, which may be used as drug target in the future. Computational tools will be shared with all researchers. Findings from this project will be disseminated widely and shared with the scientific community by presenting results at national scientific meetings and publishing in peer-reviewed journals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

EHRs provide one of the most efficient ways to examine cannabis-related health outcomes in large unbiased patient populations. In this project, we will study safety of cannabis for those with medical and psychological conditions. Outcomes will be: (1) cardiovascular events, (2) admissions for psychosis, (3) accidents, (4) suicide attempts, and (5) survey responses about anxiety, depression, and sleep, and (6) medications. We will also look at IDC codes for anxiety and mood disorders, as well as psychosis. We will also examine Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome,. These outcomes have been chosen because they have been associated with cannabis use, are major drivers of healthcare costs, and are extractable from the EHR and surveys.
Patients exposed to cannabis will be compared to those not exposed to cannabis. We will also assess levels of use of cannabis.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cannabis use)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will create a cohort of those who use cannabis and those who do not use cannabis. These will be linked to health outcomes. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of any cannabis use (by self-report) by health diagnoses/symptoms will be estimated using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models in R, adjusting for year, median neighborhood household income, age, and self-reported race/ethnicity, and potentially other substance use. We will also examine levels of cannabis use via ordinal regression.","Anticipated Findings
Safety and effectiveness of cannabis is particularly well-suited to be studied through All of Us, which will link substance use to EHRs and create an unbiased data set of those who use cannabis. The National Academy of Sciences has called for such clinical epidemiological research to investigate the safety and effectiveness of cannabis use for a variety of health conditions. We hope that this study will rigorously assess health outcomes associated with cannabis use in a rigorous, unbiased manner that will allow researchers and clinicians to better understand health risks and outcomes of cannabis use in their patients.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Do higher rates of chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases in Black participants account for higher rates of pneumococcal vaccination among this group? Are there disparities among people with chronic diseases with regards to vaccination rates?
Immunizations are one of the most important and effective preventative health measures available, but relative to public health goals, are underutilized in adults. Developing a better understanding of how vaccines are used positions us to develop strategies to mitigate modifiable risk factors and improve vaccination rates. Results from our study will address a knowledge gap in understanding data characteristics available in the All of Us dataset for younger adult participants who have received pneumococcal vaccines. Results from this study is intended to provide us with stronger justification for access to medical and pharmacy claims data to develop prediction models on which variables have the highest amplitude of impact.","Project Purpose(s)

The All of Us database will be used as a source population for a convenience sample in this cross-sectional study to characterize the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of adults who receive pneumococcal vaccines as adults.  These categories of factors will also be used to compare groups of participants who completed the hepatitis B and HPV vaccine series with those who started, but did not complete these vaccine series. Descriptive statistics, correlations and cross-tabulation will be used to describe specific differences in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, gender-based, and health- and lifestyle-related determinants of the use of vaccines in patients included in this unique database. Inferential analysis, including an emerging methodology intended to reduce the biasing effects of missing data will also be applied.","Anticipated Findings
This proposed study provides a cross-sectional evaluation of the All of Us program data to develop a baseline understanding of the relevant and available vaccination data. Most existing literature describing adult vaccination rates are based on self-reports and few focus on correlating health data. Comprehensive data regarding vaccination rates exist, but lack investigation to specific health, and sociodemographic characteristics. More importantly descriptions of vaccine studies have been mainly limited to individual vaccine types. This analysis is a follow up study of previous work utilizing the All of Us database which identified vaccination disparities consistent with the published literature. The use of bias reduction methods also has important implication for a variety of other research questions applied to large EHR databases.","Demographic Categories of Interest
