Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications. There is a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals. We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes). We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.  The citation for this work is:

A raking weighting methodology will be used to produce state-level estimates of asthma prevalence using one EHR data set, and will compare EHR-derived, state-level asthma prevalence estimates with those from traditional survey methods (e.g. derived from CDC’s survey-based Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)).","Anticipated Findings
Results of this study can help:
1) develop and refine estimates of asthma burden beyond prevalence (e.g., state-level estimates of asthma control using pharmacy dispensing data on asthma long-term controller medication and rescue medication; and/or state-level estimates of asthma-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations),

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide, with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Understanding the genetic basis of asthma is crucial for advancing our knowledge of its pathogenesis and developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Beyond its direct respiratory effects, asthma is associated with a range of comorbidities, including internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression.
The burden of asthma extends beyond individual suffering to encompass significant societal and economic impacts.
Investigating genetic variants associated with asthma susceptibility and severity can pave the way for personalized medicine approaches. By identifying individuals at higher genetic risk, healthcare providers can tailor interventions and treatments to better manage asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
Use GWAS databases such as NHGRI-EBI catalog and GWAS central to find genes that are linked to asthma susceptibility or related phenotypes. Based on previous research on this subject for a previous assignment, further discussions will be limited to SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL3 genes.
Analyze genomic sequencing data and perform variant calling using libraries like GATK. Filter the variants for SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL3 genes using BED tools.
Identify genetic variants that have been previously associated with asthma susceptibility in GWAS datasets.
Cross-reference identified asthma-associated variants with gene-disease association data from DisGeNET.
Explore the strength of evidence supporting the association between the variants and asthma in DisGeNET, considering factors such as the number of supporting studies and their experimental designs.
Determine a significance threshold for the variants based on statistical significance.","Anticipated Findings
The expected outcome of the project is the identification of specific genetic variants within the SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL13 genes that are associated with asthma susceptibility and severity. Identify how these variants affect gene expression and protein functions implicated in asthma pathophysiology. Understanding the functional consequences of these genetic variants will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma development and progression. Analyze the clinical data from asthma patients with known genotypes and determine whether specific genetic profiles are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease severity.
As a stretch goal, identify the role of environmental factors in disease susceptibility and severity for the individuals with the asthma causing genotype.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Toxic airborne exposures contribute to asthma development, but the mechanisms that connect exposure with asthma biology and the individual risk factors that contribute to this effect are not understood. We have approached this problem by identifying genetic variants that associate with asthma risk and change transcriptional responses to a model of wildfire particulate matter in cell culture.

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will perform genotype-phenotype association to compare the effect of 52 variants on asthma phenotype in a case-control analysis. We will compare the minor allele frequencies for these 52 variants in cases and controls using a one degree of freedom chi squared test and adjust for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. We will then add the important biologic covariates of age, body mass index and smoking history into the association using a logistic regression model.","Anticipated Findings
These results will validate our initial findings of these 52 common variants that develop a mechanistic connection between wildfire particulate exposure and asthma risk. This finding is critical to understanding which individuals are at highest risk of the growing impact of wildfire smoke and developing treatments targeted at the gene mechanisms to interrupt asthma development.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question: Are leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, potential repurposable drug candidates for multiple sclerosis?
Significance: Despite recent advancements in MS therapeutics, it remains that several patients still experience treatment-resistant MS. Previously, we pinpointed a repurposable drug candidate for MS via bioinformatics analyses of genomic data, a leukotriene receptor antagonist currently indicated for allergic rhinitis or asthma.* Therefore, montelukast, a widely used leukotriene receptor antagonist, may be provide a new approach for managing MS symptoms.

Datasets: Cohorts of MS patients will be identified: (1) Cases: MS patients on montelukast, (2) Controls: MS patients NOT on montelukast. Data will be collected for 2 year period.
Methods: We will apply the doubly robust causal inference methods for estimation of outcomes, which will take into consideration several confounding factors (comorbidities, indication of medication: allergic rhinits/asthma, age at baseline, diagnosis time). The outcomes will be measured based on number of relapses during study period, which will be determined based on corticosteroid prescriptions and inpatient hospitalizations.

We are estimating cumulative incidence of common disaeases (heart disease, diabetes, asthma) across polygenic score strata after appropriately modelling for age and sex.

Previous studies have shown that living somewhere with high levels of air pollution makes it more likely that a person will develop asthma. While in the long term we need to decrease air pollution levels nationwide, we urgently need ways to protect people exposed to air pollution. To do this, we need to understand how being exposed to air pollution leads to asthma. Knowing which genetic variants make a person more likely to develop asthma when they are exposed to air pollution can help us with this. First, because it may show us which people are especially at risk and therefor allow us to target these people with screening or public health interventions and second, because these genetic variants may point to certain biological processes that we can then target with medications.","Project Purpose(s)

This project aims to enhance pharmacogenetics and equity in severe asthma (SA) by developing statistical learning models. Despite comprising less than 10% of asthma cases, SA significantly burdens patients and healthcare systems, accounting for over 50% of asthma-related healthcare utilization. While most asthma patients respond to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), approximately one-third show minimal or no response. Various factors, including demographics, socioeconomics, environment, and emerging genetic evidence, contribute to SA. Notably, African Americans (AAs) face a four times higher hospitalization risk and seven times higher mortality rate from asthma compared to non-AAs. Existing asthma risk assessment techniques lack precision for minorities. This study will explore the impact of demographics, genetics, and social determinants on ICS response in SA patients of African and European ancestries.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We utilized the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) to study the impact of ICS on patients with SA. Our criteria include asthma diagnosis (ICD codes 493.x or J45.x), self-reported AA or Non-Hispanic White (NHW) ethnicity, age six or older, active ICS prescription, and availability of WES genomics data. The cohort is divided into ICS responders (controls) and non-responders (cases), with non-responders experiencing ED visits or inpatient hospitalizations related to asthma within 24 months from their first ICS prescription.
Data preprocessing involves MAF and HWE filtering, LD pruning using PLINK and imputation, dimensionality reduction and training predictive models using Python packages. Evaluation employs stratified 10-fold cross-validation with performance metrics calculation. Post-hoc analysis is done by using SHAP and LIME and GSEA tools.","Anticipated Findings
Hypothesis: Identify variants that contribute to ICS response (or lack thereof) in populations with African and European ancestries. The proposed ML pipeline will identify genetic variants that will predict ICS response within each population. This hypothesis is currently understudied due to the lack of previous focus on pharmacogenetics of ICS, especially for populations with African ancestry. We will test this hypothesis by developing and validating ML pipelines to predict ICS response using data from UTHSC and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). If successful, this research will not only inform treatment planning in asthma patients but create one of the first comprehensive machine learning (ML) pipelines in genomics that integrates demographics, and E/SDH context in pharmacogenetics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The Next Generation Sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation sequencing, have been widely used to detect such (epi-)genetic changes. However, systematic analysis multidimensional genomic data makes things more complex and has become a big challenge in the field. New approaches are urgently needed to be developed. In this project, we will develop novel and powerful computational methods to systematically discover the potential biomarker and drug target in cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, asthma, T2D, and many other metabolism diseases based on these multidimensional genomic data.","Project Purpose(s)

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are different disorders that may coexist in individual patients. Patients with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) have a greater disease burden and worse health outcomes than patients with either condition alone. To date, much of our knowledge of ACO has been extrapolated from asthma and COPD studies, which often excluded individuals with ACO. We aim to discover novel genetic risk factors of ACO and related sub-phenotypes likely caused by a range of different underlying mechanisms. While smoking causes most cases of COPD, some never-smokers develop COPD and some life-long heavy smokers do not. This study aims to perform genome-wide association studies and gene-by-environmental interaction analyses within the AllOfUs dataset to: 1) investigate genetic commonalities and differences among ACO and each disease alone, and 2) identify how smoking and non-smoking risk factors are at play in their pathophysiology.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We focus on Asthma and COPD diagnoses in AllOfUs, excluding cystic fibrosis cases. We classify explicit ACO diagnoses and individuals with both diseases as ACO cases. Our GWAS targets latent dimensions of these diagnoses and related features, including various related diseases and measurements with analogous features in UK Biobank for SNP hit validation. We hypothesize that continuous features from related phenotypes may yield stronger SNP associations than logistic regression on heterogeneous binary phenotypes, and the latent dimensions may also represent distinct interpretable clinical manifestations of otherwise heterogeneous diseases. We will analyze the genome-wide genotyping data for associations with these latent dimensions and assess interactions with environmental factors using regression models. We will use feature importance methods to ascertain which input features are responsible for the correlations with interesting SNP hits.","Anticipated Findings
Asthma, COPD, and ACO are heterogeneous diseases that likely include a number of phenotypes with distinct clinical and genetic identifiers. We can compare which genetically estimated latent dimensions significantly contribute to each of these heterogeneous diseases. In addition to comparing the genetic basis of three deeply confounded diseases, we also hope to discover novel genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions that open opportunities for disease prevention and therapeutic intervention.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma affects 339 million people worldwide and the total is expected to reach 400 million by 2025. Further, asthma disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic groups, with higher prevalence and more severe outcomes among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations. The reasons for these disparities are complex and include genetic factors and environmental exposures. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified susceptibility loci for asthma, little is known about genetic determinants that may explain racial disparities of asthma. Also, previous observational studies indicate that the mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation may differ between asthmatic smokers and non-smokers. However, the genetic characteristics and differences between these groups are unknown. Therefore, we will identify novel loci contributing to racial disparities of asthma, and compare genetic factors associated with asthma exacerbation between smokers and non-smokers.","Project Purpose(s)

Despite progress in therapeutic approaches, according to CDC about 50% of individuals with asthma continue to experience asthma attack (Asthma exacerbation) every year. Asthma attack is an acute episode of progressively worsening of asthma symptoms. Uncontrolled asthma (episodes of asthma exacerbation) can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, healthcare cost and burden, and time away from school and work. Predicting when exacerbation may occur with adequate intervention would reduce healthcare burden, save cost, and improve quality of life. However, efficient methods that can help identify personalized risk factors and make early predictions are lacking. The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and calculate saved healthcare cost. All of Us Research  database with about 35,000 asthma diagnosed patients and about 10,000 asthma attack events provide an opportunity to build a prediction model.","Project Purpose(s)

Exacerbation events will be defined as those who needed 1) an oral glucocorticoid prescription for less than 28 days (glucocorticoid burst), 2) an emergency department visit, or 3) hospitalization. Predictive models will be built using a gradient-boosting-machines framework.  We will attempt to predict by healthcare utilization type (emergency and hospitalization).  Prediction model will be built for pediatric and adult age groups separately. For each outcome, 80% of the dataset serves to train the model and 20% to validate it.","Anticipated Findings

African ancestry in individuals in the US often represents admixture among several African population groups, in addition to non-African ancestries such as European and Native American. It is also known that disease prevalence and manifestation vary with individuals' ancestral backgrounds partly because of different genetic variations and linkage structure in genomes. Since the genomes of admixed individuals appear like a mosaic of ancestry-specific genomic tracts, we can  identify ancestry-specific disease associated loci by ascertaining these tracts using local ancestry inference techniques.  This is especially important as most genetic studies underrepresent admixed populations and we have little knowledge on them.  Thus, in this study, we aim to construct fine-scale genetic ancestry in individuals with African descent and identify the relationship between ancestry and prevalence of chronic diseases such as asthma and COPD.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use the methods PCA, ADMIXTURE and fineSTRUCTURE to assess population structure of individuals of African descent from the All of Us dataset against a reference panel enriched for African ancestral populations. We should find several African ancestry derived from different populations in African continent as well as ancestries from other continent in the genomes of individuals of African descent. Then, we will infer local ancestry across genome using RFMix, ELAI, and MOSAIC. The accuracy of our local ancestry inference will be validated by comparing the global mean values with the results of ADMIXTURE. Then, we will conduct admixture mapping, association test between local ancestry tracts and disease status to find ancestry-specific disease associated loci.   We will use status of alcohol drinking , smoking, insurance, deprivation index to correct socio-racial influence to reduce the risk of stigmatization for a particular population group.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesized that different African ancestries can be identified in the genome, and that each of these ancestries show different correlations to complex disease outcomes since Africans have much more genetic variations compared to other populations and most of which were not well studied so far. Fine-scale, local ancestry information will enable us to find population-specific associations and understand the contribution of ancestry to disease risk.  Our findings will contribute to understanding the genetic basis of chronic disease in populations under-represented in genomic studies, such as African Americans.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Unraveling the role of genetic factors like FABP4 variants could provide valuable insights into the disease's pathogenesis, contribute to improved risk prediction models, and potentially pave the way for personalized therapeutic strategies. Our primary scientific question revolves around understanding the role of FABP4 gene variants in the pathogenesis and progression of asthma. Specifically, we are investigating the following queries: Are FABP4 gene variants associated with an increased risk of developing asthma? Do these genetic variants affect the severity or control of asthma symptoms? Are there significant interactions between these FABP4 genetic variants and environmental factors that may modulate asthma risk and severity?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Our study will investigate the role of FABP4 genetic variants in asthma. We will focus our work on adults and compare the prevalence of asthma diagnosis between those with and without FABP4 variants. We will also attempt to compare the prevalence of FABP4 genetic variants in asthma disease severity through an estimation of the asthma controller medications that are used (eg. Inhaled corticosteroids, or targeted biologic therapies). We will compare differences in participant characteristics using simple descriptive statistics and report the prevalence of genetic variants in asthma (by severity) compared to non-asthma participants.","Anticipated Findings
We expect there to be a greater proportion of FABP4 genetic variants in the asthma cohort compared to non-asthma. Further, we anticipate that the FABP4-variant asthma participants will have a greater overall severity of asthma with greater proportion of individuals requiring inhaled and systemic corticosteroids.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children worldwide, and displays the greatest disparities among all diseases in the United States. Children living in urban neighborhoods have disproportionately higher rates of asthma symptoms. Recent study showed that African Americans (AAs) are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from asthma than European Americans (EAs). Therefore we sought to determine whether asthma racial ancestry differences are modulated by gene, allergic comorbidities, and socioenvironmental exposure risk factors. We will identify genomic and other exposures association in different group of children from the all of us network. In addition, we aim to evaluate that asthmatics and healthy individuals are geographically clustered in specific locations potentially race-driven socio-environmental exposure risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

A major strength of this research is the existence of a well-characterized multi-site asthma cohort with infrastructure that links genetic, non-genetic factors into a single dataset. The population of interest are children and adolescents,0-21 years old, admitted  for an asthma exacerbation that are identified on an ongoing basis by research staff via electronic admission diagnosis of asthma and/or clinician activation of the treatment order set for an asthma exacerbation. We will make use of a simplified evidence synthesis protocol to select environmental covariates of interest to asthma. Then, an implied graph will be built to infer causal effects to the dataset. Finally, backdoor criterion will be used to remove any open paths, check for colliders and over control in the implied graph. Complementarily, we will perform a Variance Inflated Factor (VIF) stepwise model selection to account for multicollinearity. Multivariate models will depend from the nature of the analyzed outcome.","Anticipated Findings

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD) and related health conditions (e.g., depression and pain).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.

There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions.

The datasets will include participants who are diagnosed with asthma. We will find the first time they had a calculable TyG measurement, and follow them over time to see whether they have an asthma exacerbation (defined as an emergency or urgent care visit for asthma, a hospitalization for asthma, or an asthma-related corticosteroid prescription). Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to see if an elevated TyG measurement is associated with asthma exacerbations after adjusting for known confounders (demographic variables, comorbidities, body mass index, asthma and metabolic medication use, prior exacerbation, and eosinophil count).","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that among All of Us participants with asthma, elevated TyG will be associated with an increased hazard of asthma exacerbation, independent of known risk factors.

Unmodeled heterogeneity of the biological underpinnings of phenotypes reduces statistical power and reproducibility in downstream analyses such as genome-wide association studies. While some complex diseases have well-established clinically-relevant subtypes that respond differently to different treatments (e.g., diabetes and asthma), heterogeneity is suspected but has not so far been demonstrated for many other phenotypes. Existing data-driven subtyping methods primarily rely on data clustering methods that are not guaranteed to capture genetically- or clinically-relevant stratification of patients, thus, impeding our ability to take an important step towards personalized medicine by defining treatment at the subphenotypic level.

Asthma demonstrates high prevalence with both sex and ancestry disparities apparent in the United States. Previous studies have identified X chromosome variants as possible contributors to existing sex disparities in asthma prevalence. Existing literature also indicates that individuals with African ancestry, including African Americans, bear greater asthma risk than individuals of European and Native American ancestry. Local ancestry estimates on the X chromosome differ greatly within African descent populations. Despite the awareness of how sex and ancestry separately influence asthma susceptibility, existing literature fails to examine their interaction. Previous literature often fails to thoroughly examine asthma susceptibility in individuals of African descent, contributing to inequitable advancements in precision medicine and further driving health disparities. We hypothesize that sex moderates the effect of ancestry-specific X chromosome risk factors for asthma susceptibility.","Project Purpose(s)

We will leverage data from the All of Us Research Program, an NIH initiative to increase the diversity of participants in genetics and genomics research.

The interaction between GERD and COPD has long been recognized as excess gastric acid can exacerbate COPD and symptoms of COPD, such as cough, can contribute to GERD. Micro-aspiration of gastric contents and/or vagal reflex induced bronchospasm might contribute to the association between GERD and COPD. In COPD, increased intra-abdominal pressure and negative intra-thoracic pressure, increased cough frequency, and medications may contribute to GERD. Despite the high prevalence of GERD in COPD and medications for GERD that have been shown to improve other pulmonary disease such as asthma, the etiological relationship between GERD and COPD has not been adequately elucidated. Overall, there is evidence suggesting a shared etiology between COPD and GERD, which has not been fully explored. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of GERD in COPD in terms of genetic risk factors in COPD participants with and without GERD.","Project Purpose(s)

Study population: individuals ≥18 years with diagnosis of asthma who were on any of the biologics approved for asthma treatment (omalizumab, benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, dupilumab) between 2005 to date. We will be using summary statistics in characterizing the incidence of initiation of these biologics, switches from one biologic to another (and when the switch occurred), and/or discontinuation. To evaluate if these switches were due to effectiveness of these biologics, we will evaluate asthma exacerbations while on the biologics.

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (substance use disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will examine the relationship between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and CRP by regressing CRP on the cannabis use measures in the All of Us dataset. All models will control for covariates including age, sex, race and BMI. We may construct additional models that covary for comorbid conditions such as depression or asthma. Additionally, we will examine demographic counts for the variables of interest in our study.","Anticipated Findings
We would anticipate to find an association between cannabis use and CRP levels, with cannabis use in the last three months being associated with lower CRP levels. On the other hand, we would expect to find that cannabis use disorder (or some other measure of heavy use) is associated with higher CRP levels. This project could help untangle how the relationship between cannabis use and CRP changes according to level of cannabis use.

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions.

Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are the two most common respiratory diseases. Therefore, understanding the characteristics and frequency of participants with either of these diseases in the US by analyzing the All of Us database has public health implications. We will analyze the relationship of diagnosis for each disease to known risk factors and covariates including gender, age, race, BMI, smoking status, level of education and common comorbidities.","Project Purpose(s)

Other Purpose (This work is the result of an All of Us Research Program Demonstration Project. Demonstration Projects are efforts by the All of Us Research Program designed to meet the goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating precision medicine. This work has been approved, reviewed, and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy.)","Scientific Approaches
Standard statistical analysis will be used to determine the frequency of asthma or COPD diagnoses in the EHR and surveys in relationship to gender, age, BMI, race, educational status as a reflection of socioeconomic status (SES), regions of the country, co-morbidities and smoking status. Results will be compared to published data including the CDC. Since COPD is under diagnosed in the US, we will compare the demographics and health characteristics of participants with a significant history of smoking (but no diagnosis of COPD) to participants with a COPD diagnosis. In addition, we will examine the medication data in the EHR for comparison with the published guidelines for treatment of both of these diseases.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate a higher frequency of asthma in women compared men but that men are more likely to have reported that asthma started in childhood. In addition, we anticipate a higher frequency of asthma and less medication use in African-Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. Since COPD is mainly due to cigarette smoking, we anticipate that participants with a diagnosis of COPD are more likely to be men of middle to older age with a significant history of tobacco exposure. In addition, we expect that a proportion of participants with a significant history of smoking will not have a diagnosis of COPD either by EHR or survey but may report symptoms of airways disease. Also, the degree of misclassification of the two diseases will be determined; for example, a young adult with a limited degree of tobacco exposure diagnosed as COPD is more likely to have asthma. In both diseases, we expect an increase frequency of common comorbidities including increased BMI.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The specific scientific question I intend to study is: ""What is the association between air pollution and the incidence of lung cancer?"" This question is of paramount importance due to the increasing global burden of lung cancer and the growing evidence that air pollution plays a significant role in the etiology of respiratory diseases, including lung cancer. Understanding this association is critical for several reasons:
Public Health Impact: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Identifying and quantifying the role of air pollution in lung cancer development could lead to targeted public health interventions, policies for air quality improvement, and ultimately, a reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cancer)","Scientific Approaches
Datasets:
Air Quality Data: Sources could include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) database.
Health Outcomes Data: Acquire lung cancer incidence and mortality data from cancer registries. This data will include information on lung cancer cases, demographic variables (age, sex), and geographic location.
Covariate Data: Collect data on potential confounders and effect modifiers, including smoking rates, socio-economic status, and occupational exposures
Research Methods:
Exposure Assessment: Use  models to estimate individual or community-level exposure to air pollutants based on residential or workplace locations.
Epidemiological Analysis: Conduct observational studies, such as cohort or case-control studies, to assess the relationship between air pollution exposure and lung cancer risk. This will involve calculating relative risks, odds ratios, and attributable risks, adjusting for confounders.","Anticipated Findings
The study aims to identify a quantitative relationship between long-term exposure to specific air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2) and the incidence of lung cancer. Findings are expected to highlight the risk increase associated with certain levels of exposure.
Through spatial analysis, the research may uncover geographic patterns in the correlation between air pollution levels and lung cancer rates, identifying areas with elevated risks.
Public Health Policies: The findings will provide robust evidence to support the development of targeted public health policies and air quality standards aimed at reducing lung cancer incidence. This evidence can advocate for stricter air pollution controls and inform guidelines for safe exposure levels.
Environmental Justice: Identifying spatial hotspots and differential risks can contribute to the discourse on environmental justice, highlighting communities disproportionately affected by air pollution and prompting targeted interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or stillbirth, is defined in the US as death ≥20 weeks gestation and occurs in about 1 in 160 pregnancies (CDC). Numerous medical risk factors have been identified as contributing to stillbirth, as have several social determinants, such as race, income, education, access to antenatal cate, air pollution, and drug use.  There is a paucity of literature examining the association of social determinants of health on IUFD as well as the impact social determinants of health have on stillbirth evaluation. Previous literature has shown placental pathology, fetal autopsy, and genetic testing identified as the most useful in determining stillbirth cause. However, little data analyzing whether socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are receiving these recommended evaluations exists.

Epidemiological evidence has shown climate change (including extreme heat and elevated temperature) and air pollution have adverse effects on population health, especially cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases. However, there is limited information on individual susceptibility to climate change and air pollution in terms of genetic variant, lifestyle and behavior factors. The overall aim of this project is to investigate how climate change, air pollution and lifestyle are affecting cardiometabolic diseases among representative US population in the All of US program. First, we will investigate how climate-related extreme events and air pollution together impact cardiometabolic disease incidence and mortality. Second, we will examine whether lifestyle and behavior information modify the impact of environmental factor on cardiometabolic health.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 80 million people. The exact mechanisms of glaucoma development remain unclear, but oxidative stress, inflammatory pathways,  and microvascular changes have been shown to play an important role. The same mechanisms have been linked to air pollution and recent studies have shown that greater exposure of air pollutants are associated with both self-reported glaucoma and adverse structural characteristics of the disease.

The world has witnessed on-going urbanization and globalization for decades.  Currently, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and the proportion is expected to go up to about 66% by 2050.  The number of people living outside their country of origin has also been increasing over the last two decades.   This global trend is evident in largest cities in the world such as New York, suggesting rapid and extensive admixture of individuals with different ancestry inside the city. This admixture is different from the admixture we experienced before in many points. Thus, it is important to understand what would happen in our genome in the city from the perspective of population genetics.
Additionally, the environment in urban area is very unique: E.g. high density of people, heavy traffic, heavy air pollution, low level of physical activity and etc. These unique environment can drive evolution though gene environment interaction.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To assess what genetic features in cities are different from those in rural areas,  we will categorize All Of US participants by the level of urbanization based on zip code data and compare several statistics (e.g. genetic diversity). To understand what is happening in a large city, we will analyze population structure in New York City by PCA, ADMIXTURE, UMAP and IBD sharing network and compare with New York States. We will also infer local ancestry for each individual using MOSAIC and gnomix to compare ancestry composition in each individual's genome.","Anticipated Findings
By analyzing NYC participants, we will find several founder populations and many recently admixed individuals. By combining EHR data, we will be able to find population-specific disease and associated variants. This may improve our understanding of disease background for underrepresented populations such as admixed populations and small founder populations.
Higher genetic diversity and higher rate of assortative mating are anticipated in the city than rural area. Our findings may be helpful to create future frameworks of genomic study such as Genome-wide association study (GWAS) because some genetic features like assortative mating would contradict the assumption of current framework.
Inferring local ancestry is important for finding disease-associated variants in admixed individuals. We will provide the results to other researchers to enhance genetic researches in admixed populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We plan to use general demographic data (such as age, sex, ethnicity, education, income), general comorbidity data (included in conditions), air pollution data (particulate matter equal or less than 2.5μm [PM2.5]) and SNP/intel variants.
To verify which SNPs are more associated with chronic rhinosinusitis, we are going to perform a wide genome association study (GWAS). Then, we are going to perform logistic regressions, using interaction terms, to see whether the association of air pollution with chronic rhinosinusitis is modified.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that some SNPs can modify the relationship between air pollution and chronic rhinosinusitis in our modification analyses.

This research will use exploratory geospatial and descriptive analysis approach to attain a preliminary understanding of the spatial association and distribution of geographic stressors and the variation in the distribution of mental health risks. This approach will use exploratory mapping, row standardized spatial weights, descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analysis based on ordinary least square (OLS) methods.
In addition, this research will utilize data reduction methods including principle component analysis and Latent profile analysis to identify constellation of exposure to geographic environmental and social stressors. Exposures identified to influence outcomes of interest with the exploratory spatial descriptive analysis (above), will be used in this phase of the analysis.","Anticipated Findings
This research will go beyond the prior research focused on either social or environmental exposures and incorporate analysis of the synergistic effects of these factors that make up these different neighborhood contexts. Synergistic effects on the brain have been hypothesized via systemic inflammation, vascular degeneration, and alterations in blood-brain barrier permeability. However, few studies have been able to disentangle cause and effect relationship between social stressors and environmental hazards with health outcomes. Studies that analyze synergistic effects document issues with temporal misclassification of exposures, spatial statistical power or autocorrelation.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are interested generally in risk factors for developing autoimmune diseases, in particular but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, at the population level. We are interested in environmental risk factors (air pollution, heat, pesticides, etc.), psychosocial factors (stress, emotional distress, trauma, PTSD, depression, resilience), social determinants of health (access to food, work, housing, neighborhood factors) , and behavioral lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, exercise, obesity, diet, work hours, etc.). We are interested in characterizing the sociodemographics of the populations affected and estimating the population attributable risk for each of these factors and in combinations.  When genome-wide data are available, we will be interested in genetic risk factors for autoimmune diseases, and how they may interact with environmental risk factors to produce immune dysregulation and then disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to assemble cohorts of individuals with incident and prevalent autoimmune diseases (concentrating on SLE and RA, but also investigating other related autoimmune diseases) and matched controls to investigate the prevalence of these risk factors, populations most affected, magnitude of the risk estimates and population attributable risks. In cross-sectional analyses, we will use logistic regression models.","Anticipated Findings
We have previously studied many of these risk factors, and their interactions with genetic factors, among women in the prospective Nurses' Health Study and to an extent in the Black Women's Health Study,  the Women's Health Study, and Roxbury Lupus Study. These studies have all been limited to females, had mainly older adult participants, and have had limited racial and ethnic diversity. For these reasons, we aim to confirm and extend our research into more diverse population-based cohorts and expect that all of these factors will be associated with risk of these autoimmune diseases. We intend to examine the  magnitudes of effects observed and the population attributable risks. These studies will contribute greatly to our knowledge of autoimmune disease risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, and potential pathogenesis of these complex diseases, in diverse US populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities exist widely in the breast cancer outcomes (incidence, survival, and quality-of-life). When compared with white women, African American women have higher recurrence and death rates from breast cancer although they have a lower incidence rate. It is well established that both community and individual level risk factors play important roles in the breast cancer outcomes.
We will take advantage of the comprehensive database collected by the All of Us project to investigate the observed racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes. Using the novel multilevel mediation analysis method, we will identify modifiable factors that can explain the racial disparities observed in breast cancer outcomes. The risk factors to be considered include measures at both the environmental (e.g. pollution measurements) and individual levels (e.g., smoking behavior and gene expressions).","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will identify important genes and investigate their relative contribution in breast cancer progression to determine how the neighborhood environment interacts with gene expressions, leading to their alteration in different racial groups and thus influencing associated racial health disparities. All female participants who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will be included for analysis. We will also entail cross-sectional data analysis of multilevel data, nesting individual gene expression data in neighborhoods, to analyze the competing risks of the neighborhood environment for breast cancer. As described in the AoU data dictionary, participants’ residential addresses were geo-coded and the socio-economic status of the residential address are linked to patients according to the zip codes.  We have generated neighborhood risk factors from public-available datasets and will link the neighborhood risk factors with each participant. We will use the mediation analysis method.","Anticipated Findings
A clear understanding of the etiologic factors underlying health disparities is essential for designing screenings, treatments and interventions for optimally reducing disparities. The multilevel statistical methods developed through the project can help explain a wide array of health disparities. We will test the use of AoU database to investigate its potential of helping generate and test hypothesis that aims at ultimately filling in knowledge gaps and improving biomedical and epidemiological research in health disparities.","Demographic Categories of Interest
