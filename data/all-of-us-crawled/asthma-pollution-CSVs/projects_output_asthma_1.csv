Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide, with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Understanding the genetic basis of asthma is crucial for advancing our knowledge of its pathogenesis and developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Beyond its direct respiratory effects, asthma is associated with a range of comorbidities, including internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression.
The burden of asthma extends beyond individual suffering to encompass significant societal and economic impacts.
Investigating genetic variants associated with asthma susceptibility and severity can pave the way for personalized medicine approaches. By identifying individuals at higher genetic risk, healthcare providers can tailor interventions and treatments to better manage asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
Use GWAS databases such as NHGRI-EBI catalog and GWAS central to find genes that are linked to asthma susceptibility or related phenotypes. Based on previous research on this subject for a previous assignment, further discussions will be limited to SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL3 genes.
Analyze genomic sequencing data and perform variant calling using libraries like GATK. Filter the variants for SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL3 genes using BED tools.
Identify genetic variants that have been previously associated with asthma susceptibility in GWAS datasets.
Cross-reference identified asthma-associated variants with gene-disease association data from DisGeNET.
Explore the strength of evidence supporting the association between the variants and asthma in DisGeNET, considering factors such as the number of supporting studies and their experimental designs.
Determine a significance threshold for the variants based on statistical significance.","Anticipated Findings
The expected outcome of the project is the identification of specific genetic variants within the SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL13 genes that are associated with asthma susceptibility and severity. Identify how these variants affect gene expression and protein functions implicated in asthma pathophysiology. Understanding the functional consequences of these genetic variants will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma development and progression. Analyze the clinical data from asthma patients with known genotypes and determine whether specific genetic profiles are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease severity.
As a stretch goal, identify the role of environmental factors in disease susceptibility and severity for the individuals with the asthma causing genotype.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Toxic airborne exposures contribute to asthma development, but the mechanisms that connect exposure with asthma biology and the individual risk factors that contribute to this effect are not understood. We have approached this problem by identifying genetic variants that associate with asthma risk and change transcriptional responses to a model of wildfire particulate matter in cell culture.

We will perform genotype-phenotype association to compare the effect of 52 variants on asthma phenotype in a case-control analysis. We will compare the minor allele frequencies for these 52 variants in cases and controls using a one degree of freedom chi squared test and adjust for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. We will then add the important biologic covariates of age, body mass index and smoking history into the association using a logistic regression model.","Anticipated Findings
These results will validate our initial findings of these 52 common variants that develop a mechanistic connection between wildfire particulate exposure and asthma risk. This finding is critical to understanding which individuals are at highest risk of the growing impact of wildfire smoke and developing treatments targeted at the gene mechanisms to interrupt asthma development.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question: Are leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, potential repurposable drug candidates for multiple sclerosis?
Significance: Despite recent advancements in MS therapeutics, it remains that several patients still experience treatment-resistant MS. Previously, we pinpointed a repurposable drug candidate for MS via bioinformatics analyses of genomic data, a leukotriene receptor antagonist currently indicated for allergic rhinitis or asthma.* Therefore, montelukast, a widely used leukotriene receptor antagonist, may be provide a new approach for managing MS symptoms.

We are estimating cumulative incidence of common disaeases (heart disease, diabetes, asthma) across polygenic score strata after appropriately modelling for age and sex. This has been done in European populations and we are validating the method on diverse ancestries. We will use broad geographic categories for ancestry as used by the 1000 Genomes Project (East Asian, South Asian, African, Hispanic, European). This is important to consider all participants and not just those of European ancestry. This is a first step in providing patients with absolute rather than relative risks when polygenic scores are implemented in the clinic.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We use Global Burden of Disease estimates of mortality and prevalence to estimate baseline hazards. This allows us to have a more generalized estimate of disease risk when using biobank data. We will use genotype data and EHR to estimate polygenic scores and define disease cases and healthy controls. This work is also being carried out in global biobanks.","Anticipated Findings
We will provide cumulative incidences for diseases across polygenic score strata stratified by ancestry, age, and sex. We anticipate finding similar trends of cumulative incidence across ancestry groups but it's important to fairly consider these groups given different allele frequencies and socioeconomic determinants of health.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Air pollution sensitivity and asthma incidence,"Previous studies have shown that living somewhere with high levels of air pollution makes it more likely that a person will develop asthma.

Previous studies have shown that living somewhere with high levels of air pollution makes it more likely that a person will develop asthma. While in the long term we need to decrease air pollution levels nationwide, we urgently need ways to protect people exposed to air pollution. To do this, we need to understand how being exposed to air pollution leads to asthma. Knowing which genetic variants make a person more likely to develop asthma when they are exposed to air pollution can help us with this. First, because it may show us which people are especially at risk and therefor allow us to target these people with screening or public health interventions and second, because these genetic variants may point to certain biological processes that we can then target with medications.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan on using data from the Environmental Protection Agency to determine which people live in areas with high levels of air pollution. In this group of people, we plan on comparing the genetic variants between people with asthma and people without asthma.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to validate genetic variants that have been previously linked with developing asthma when exposed to air pollution and discover new variants. This may help us define at risk populations and therapeutic targets. Given the inequitable distribution of air pollution exposure in the United States, protecting exposed populations from the effects of air pollution may help reduce asthma inequities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to enhance pharmacogenetics and equity in severe asthma (SA) by developing statistical learning models. Despite comprising less than 10% of asthma cases, SA significantly burdens patients and healthcare systems, accounting for over 50% of asthma-related healthcare utilization. While most asthma patients respond to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), approximately one-third show minimal or no response. Various factors, including demographics, socioeconomics, environment, and emerging genetic evidence, contribute to SA. Notably, African Americans (AAs) face a four times higher hospitalization risk and seven times higher mortality rate from asthma compared to non-AAs. Existing asthma risk assessment techniques lack precision for minorities. This study will explore the impact of demographics, genetics, and social determinants on ICS response in SA patients of African and European ancestries.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We utilized the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) to study the impact of ICS on patients with SA. Our criteria include asthma diagnosis (ICD codes 493.x or J45.x), self-reported AA or Non-Hispanic White (NHW) ethnicity, age six or older, active ICS prescription, and availability of WES genomics data. The cohort is divided into ICS responders (controls) and non-responders (cases), with non-responders experiencing ED visits or inpatient hospitalizations related to asthma within 24 months from their first ICS prescription.
Data preprocessing involves MAF and HWE filtering, LD pruning using PLINK and imputation, dimensionality reduction and training predictive models using Python packages. Evaluation employs stratified 10-fold cross-validation with performance metrics calculation. Post-hoc analysis is done by using SHAP and LIME and GSEA tools.","Anticipated Findings
Hypothesis: Identify variants that contribute to ICS response (or lack thereof) in populations with African and European ancestries. The proposed ML pipeline will identify genetic variants that will predict ICS response within each population. This hypothesis is currently understudied due to the lack of previous focus on pharmacogenetics of ICS, especially for populations with African ancestry. We will test this hypothesis by developing and validating ML pipelines to predict ICS response using data from UTHSC and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). If successful, this research will not only inform treatment planning in asthma patients but create one of the first comprehensive machine learning (ML) pipelines in genomics that integrates demographics, and E/SDH context in pharmacogenetics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A large proportion of human diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, T2D and asthma) are caused by genetic or epigenetic changes. These changes thus can serve as biomarkers for disease detection or drug targets for disease treatment. The Next Generation Sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation sequencing, have been widely used to detect such (epi-)genetic changes. However, systematic analysis multidimensional genomic data makes things more complex and has become a big challenge in the field. New approaches are urgently needed to be developed. In this project, we will develop novel and powerful computational methods to systematically discover the potential biomarker and drug target in cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, asthma, T2D, and many other metabolism diseases based on these multidimensional genomic data.","Project Purpose(s)

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are different disorders that may coexist in individual patients. Patients with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) have a greater disease burden and worse health outcomes than patients with either condition alone. To date, much of our knowledge of ACO has been extrapolated from asthma and COPD studies, which often excluded individuals with ACO. We aim to discover novel genetic risk factors of ACO and related sub-phenotypes likely caused by a range of different underlying mechanisms. While smoking causes most cases of COPD, some never-smokers develop COPD and some life-long heavy smokers do not. This study aims to perform genome-wide association studies and gene-by-environmental interaction analyses within the AllOfUs dataset to: 1) investigate genetic commonalities and differences among ACO and each disease alone, and 2) identify how smoking and non-smoking risk factors are at play in their pathophysiology.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We focus on Asthma and COPD diagnoses in AllOfUs, excluding cystic fibrosis cases. We classify explicit ACO diagnoses and individuals with both diseases as ACO cases. Our GWAS targets latent dimensions of these diagnoses and related features, including various related diseases and measurements with analogous features in UK Biobank for SNP hit validation. We hypothesize that continuous features from related phenotypes may yield stronger SNP associations than logistic regression on heterogeneous binary phenotypes, and the latent dimensions may also represent distinct interpretable clinical manifestations of otherwise heterogeneous diseases. We will analyze the genome-wide genotyping data for associations with these latent dimensions and assess interactions with environmental factors using regression models. We will use feature importance methods to ascertain which input features are responsible for the correlations with interesting SNP hits.","Anticipated Findings
Asthma, COPD, and ACO are heterogeneous diseases that likely include a number of phenotypes with distinct clinical and genetic identifiers. We can compare which genetically estimated latent dimensions significantly contribute to each of these heterogeneous diseases. In addition to comparing the genetic basis of three deeply confounded diseases, we also hope to discover novel genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions that open opportunities for disease prevention and therapeutic intervention.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.

We will examine the degree of overlap (co-occurrence) of different obstructive lung diagnoses (asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis), and we will examine whether the overlap of these conditions differs by sex/gender, ethnicity, smoking history, geographic region, BMI, and socioeconomic status. We will examine clinical and laboratory data that support the diagnosis of these conditions, assessing the degree to which diagnostic overlap appears to clinical and laboratory features as opposed to diagnostic mislabeling. We will also examine the co-occurrence of these conditions with other common cardio-pulmonary conditions including pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and heart failure. Additionally, we will examine how treatment varies among patients with one obstructive lung disease compared to those with overlapping diagnoses.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Obstructive lung diseases)","Scientific Approaches
Our analyses will require variables from all EHR Domains datasets: conditions, drug exposures, labs and measurements, and procedures. We will also require variables from the Survey Questions domains of The Basics, Lifestyle and Overall Health to examine demographics, smoking history, family history and ethnicity in relation to these conditions. We will use standard statistical approaches within R to examine descriptive statistics, correlations and between-group differences.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that we will find significant overlap of these above stated conditions, but that the prevalence of overlap will vary amongst population subgroups. We further hypothesize that some degree of overlap will be due to diagnostic mislabeling not supported by diagnostic testing in the EHR data. The presence of higher overlap of these conditions within certain groups may provide clues into the pathophysiology and prevention of these conditions. We also hypothesize that the treatment for these three obstructive lung diseases and the various overlap combinations will differ among patient subgroups defined by demographic factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma affects 339 million people worldwide and the total is expected to reach 400 million by 2025. Further, asthma disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic groups, with higher prevalence and more severe outcomes among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations. The reasons for these disparities are complex and include genetic factors and environmental exposures. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified susceptibility loci for asthma, little is known about genetic determinants that may explain racial disparities of asthma. Also, previous observational studies indicate that the mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation may differ between asthmatic smokers and non-smokers. However, the genetic characteristics and differences between these groups are unknown. Therefore, we will identify novel loci contributing to racial disparities of asthma, and compare genetic factors associated with asthma exacerbation between smokers and non-smokers.","Project Purpose(s)

Despite progress in therapeutic approaches, according to CDC about 50% of individuals with asthma continue to experience asthma attack (Asthma exacerbation) every year. Asthma attack is an acute episode of progressively worsening of asthma symptoms. Uncontrolled asthma (episodes of asthma exacerbation) can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, healthcare cost and burden, and time away from school and work. Predicting when exacerbation may occur with adequate intervention would reduce healthcare burden, save cost, and improve quality of life. However, efficient methods that can help identify personalized risk factors and make early predictions are lacking. The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and calculate saved healthcare cost. All of Us Research  database with about 35,000 asthma diagnosed patients and about 10,000 asthma attack events provide an opportunity to build a prediction model.","Project Purpose(s)

Predictive models will be built using a gradient-boosting-machines framework.  We will attempt to predict by healthcare utilization type (emergency and hospitalization).  Prediction model will be built for pediatric and adult age groups separately. For each outcome, 80% of the dataset serves to train the model and 20% to validate it.","Anticipated Findings

African ancestry in individuals in the US often represents admixture among several African population groups, in addition to non-African ancestries such as European and Native American. It is also known that disease prevalence and manifestation vary with individuals' ancestral backgrounds partly because of different genetic variations and linkage structure in genomes. Since the genomes of admixed individuals appear like a mosaic of ancestry-specific genomic tracts, we can  identify ancestry-specific disease associated loci by ascertaining these tracts using local ancestry inference techniques.  This is especially important as most genetic studies underrepresent admixed populations and we have little knowledge on them.  Thus, in this study, we aim to construct fine-scale genetic ancestry in individuals with African descent and identify the relationship between ancestry and prevalence of chronic diseases such as asthma and COPD.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use the methods PCA, ADMIXTURE and fineSTRUCTURE to assess population structure of individuals of African descent from the All of Us dataset against a reference panel enriched for African ancestral populations. We should find several African ancestry derived from different populations in African continent as well as ancestries from other continent in the genomes of individuals of African descent. Then, we will infer local ancestry across genome using RFMix, ELAI, and MOSAIC. The accuracy of our local ancestry inference will be validated by comparing the global mean values with the results of ADMIXTURE. Then, we will conduct admixture mapping, association test between local ancestry tracts and disease status to find ancestry-specific disease associated loci.   We will use status of alcohol drinking , smoking, insurance, deprivation index to correct socio-racial influence to reduce the risk of stigmatization for a particular population group.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesized that different African ancestries can be identified in the genome, and that each of these ancestries show different correlations to complex disease outcomes since Africans have much more genetic variations compared to other populations and most of which were not well studied so far. Fine-scale, local ancestry information will enable us to find population-specific associations and understand the contribution of ancestry to disease risk.  Our findings will contribute to understanding the genetic basis of chronic disease in populations under-represented in genomic studies, such as African Americans.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our objective is to define trajectories of asthma exacerbation among patients with asthma, and to identify comorbidities which predict the most severe trajectory of asthma exacerbation.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
Trajectory analysis will be used to identify patterns of asthma exacerbation among a cohort of patients with asthma Then we  will perform a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to determine comorbidities that are associated with experiencing the most severe exacerbation trajectory. We are repeating this analysis with several cohorts of participants with asthma to identify any trends, with the cohort from All of Us being one of these. These results will be used to generate a phenomic risk score to predict severe asthma exacerbations. The All of Us cohort will include participants who have at least 2 outpatient or 1 inpatient visit for asthma from 2014-2018.","Anticipated Findings
Identifying novel non-allergic determinants of severe asthma is a high scientific research priority. A hypothesis-agnostic pheWAS has not been applied to trajectories of asthma exacerbation previously.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.

What are the racial and sex differences in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, and eczema within the American population?
Seasonal allergies impact a chunk of the American population and allergic rhinitis is one of the most common symptoms. There are many health disparities that exist within immune diseases, but not many studies examining the epidemiology of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Using the All of Us dataset, this study aims to identify racial, ethnic, and sex differences that exist between populations who experience allergic rhinitis.","Project Purpose(s)

Population Health
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Calculating and summarizing descriptive statistics to examine the prevalence and distribution of allergic rhinitis among different racial, ethnic, and sex groups. Functions like table(), prop.table(), and summary() can be used to generate frequency tables, proportions, and summary statistics.
Conducting comparative analysis between different racial, ethnic, and sex groups to identify differences in the prevalence or severity of allergic rhinitis. This can involve statistical tests such as chi-square tests, t-tests, or analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of differences between groups.
Utilizing packages like ggplot2 to generate bar plots, box plots, or other relevant visualizations to compare allergic rhinitis prevalence across different demographic groups.
Performing multivariate analysis, such as logistic regression, to examine the independent effects of race, ethnicity, and sex on allergic rhinitis while controlling for potential confounding variables.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find variations in the prevalence and severity of allergic rhinitis across racial, ethnic, and sex groups. These findings will contribute to our scientific knowledge by highlighting the unequal burden of allergies among different populations. This information can help us develop strategies to address these disparities and eventually lead to a study that examines the application of precision medicine.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1- Can we use All of Us data to investigate the most common comorbidities that could accompany immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs)? We want to utilize the unique data collected by the All of Us program including patient’s diagnosis,  medications and demographics such as underrepresented race data, and find the most common comorbidities that could accompany an IMID condition. We will then use the statistical methods to identify the significantly correlated conditions with each immune mediated inflammatory disease.
2- Can we identify the factors that accommodate the occurrence of these comorbidities in patients with IMID conditions? This will help to understand the risk factors that could affect the risk of developing conditions such as cancer, Asthma or other chronic and non-chronic conditions in patients who have dysregulated immune systems.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Immune-mediated Inflammatory Disease)","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we plan on using the parametric and nonparametric statistical methods such as hypothesis testing to identify the correlation between different conditions in patients with and without IMIDs.
Further, we want to demonstrate the effect of an IMID patient’s characteristics on developing chronic and other conditions after being diagnosed with at least one IMID condition. We will be using hypothesis testing to test the significance of each risk score and scikit learn packages to develop risk score models. In addition, we will be using algorithms such as SHAP to find the most effective risk factors in developing sequelae for IMID patients.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the correlation and effect of several risk factors on developing conditions such as cancer and chronic diseases in patients with IMID. In addition we will investigate the importance of clinical interventions in reducing the quality of life of patients with autoimmune conditions.
We expect to find: 1) the ease in using data from different sources (EHR and survey data) to build a model or calculate a risk of developing different conditions in patients with at least one IMID condition. 2) heterogeneity in the All of Us population, 3) More complete information about patients with IMIDs which could help us with understanding the mechanism of action in each of these conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma is a common chronic disease worldwide and displays the greatest disparities among all diseases in the United States. Those living in urban neighborhoods have disproportionately higher rates of asthma symptoms. A recent study showed that African Americans are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from asthma than compared to non-Hispanic White Americans. The ability to afford medication is a major determinant of medication adherence among patients. Therefore we sought to examine the racial and ethnic differences in asthma medication adherence in the United States.","Project Purpose(s)

1. Understand the prevalence of asthma in a diverse patient population.
2. Explore the correlation between asthma and other atopic conditions related to Th2 pathway.
3. Compare pulmonary functions among different asthma subgroups.
Significance: Asthma is a complex disease, often misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed due to its complex presentation and overlapping symptoms with other pulmonary dysfunctions. This project wants to explore asthma prevalence and its severity manifested by pulmonary impairments in a diverse population. The study can help us evaluate biomarkers to diagnose asthma and evaluate asthma severity.","Project Purpose(s)

I plan to use “all of us” dataset as a comparative dataset to analyze the prevalence of asthma disease and its association with other Th2 pathway related atopic conditions, allergy, contact dermatitis, etc. Depending on the availability of pulmonary function data, I want to explore the correlation between asthma, asthma related comorbidities, and the correlated lung function evaluations. Since the prevalence of asthma has been shown to be vary among different socio-economic groups, I want to use the “all of us” as a comparative dataset to discern any differences due to different study subject compositions.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to observe that the asthma and certain atopic co-morbidities are more likely to co-localize in subgroups of patients presenting a more severe lung function phenotype.

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 1%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD) and related health conditions (e.g., depression and pain).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Second, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We hypothesize that the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) is associated with an increased risk of asthma exacerbation among those with asthma. Using a different dataset, we have found that people with an elevated baseline TyG were at higher risk for asthma exacerbation, even after adjusting for known confounders. We would like to see if these results can be replicated with data from All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
The datasets will include participants who are diagnosed with asthma. We will find the first time they had a calculable TyG measurement, and follow them over time to see whether they have an asthma exacerbation (defined as an emergency or urgent care visit for asthma, a hospitalization for asthma, or an asthma-related corticosteroid prescription). Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to see if an elevated TyG measurement is associated with asthma exacerbations after adjusting for known confounders (demographic variables, comorbidities, body mass index, asthma and metabolic medication use, prior exacerbation, and eosinophil count).","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that among All of Us participants with asthma, elevated TyG will be associated with an increased hazard of asthma exacerbation, independent of known risk factors. If we can replicate this finding with All of Us data, then our results would be more generalizable, and TyG measurements might be useful in identifying asthma patients who could benefit from more intensive asthma treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This study asks which subpopulations with asthma have a higher likelihood of mortality. In a preceding study, characteristics such as sex and race or ethnicity, as well as type of provider and region, were found to impact the likelihood of receiving guideline-appropriate medications for asthma exacerbation. Identifying which subpopulations experience the worst health disparities can lead to more effectively targeted public health interventions, improved provider curricula, and health policy that delivers equitable care. Understanding the extent to which treatment disparities impact lost years of life is a social justice issue for those with asthma. This study informs  the equitable distribution of limited public health resources.","Project Purpose(s)

Condition, observation, and death datasets will be utilized to create queries that describe asthma mortality in terms of subpopulation. Statistical analyses will be conducted within the Jupyter program. Chi-square analysis will be utilized to determine significance of proposed predictors on the risk of mortality. Odds ratios will be generated with logistic regression to quantify the extent to which subpopulation membership predicts mortality.","Anticipated Findings
This study is anticipated to support and possibly quantify how severely asthma raises the risk of death among subpopulations. This study would provide support to the rest of this research trajectory that aims to describe pediatric asthma treatment compliance by providers and the impacts of non-compliance. Patient adherence to asthma control medication is well described in the literature. Among the few articles analyzing provider adherence to medication prescription guidelines for persistent asthma, little is known about provider adherence to these prescribing guidelines for children.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic childhood conditions in the United States. Recent studies have identified genetic and environmental exposure factors that contribute to asthma risk; however, the extent to which these factors explain a person's risk to asthma and asthma related diseases remain largely unknown. The specific question of the proposed research is to determine to what extent asthma and asthma related-diseases risk are modified by environmental exposure risk factors. Our long-term goal is to develop a program of study that would lead to an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between genetics,  ancestry and environmental exposure causes of asthma and establish the utility of this information to predict and reduce asthma risk in children. An interplay of genetic and environmental factors are thought to be necessary for asthma to develop.","Project Purpose(s)

Asthma demonstrates high prevalence with both sex and ancestry disparities apparent in the United States. Previous studies have identified X chromosome variants as possible contributors to existing sex disparities in asthma prevalence. Existing literature also indicates that individuals with African ancestry, including African Americans, bear greater asthma risk than individuals of European and Native American ancestry. Local ancestry estimates on the X chromosome differ greatly within African descent populations. Despite the awareness of how sex and ancestry separately influence asthma susceptibility, existing literature fails to examine their interaction. Previous literature often fails to thoroughly examine asthma susceptibility in individuals of African descent, contributing to inequitable advancements in precision medicine and further driving health disparities. We hypothesize that sex moderates the effect of ancestry-specific X chromosome risk factors for asthma susceptibility.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
We will leverage data from the All of Us Research Program, an NIH initiative to increase the diversity of participants in genetics and genomics research. We will also use RFMix to characterize local ancestry across the X chromosome. Furthermore, we will utilize Tractor to elucidate local-ancestry specific variants identified with asthma, improve power, and cut down on multiple testing corrections. Lastly, we will fit logistic regression models to test the independent, joint, and modifying (i.e., interaction) effects of sex and local ancestry at known X chromosome risk variants.","Anticipated Findings

- Quantification of  the independent, joint, and interaction effects of sex and genetic ancestry on asthma prevalence in individuals with African ancestry
- Identification of local-ancestry specific variants identified with asthma
-  Quantification of the modifying effects of environmental risk factors on genetic risk for asthma in individuals with African ancestry

The interaction between GERD and COPD has long been recognized as excess gastric acid can exacerbate COPD and symptoms of COPD, such as cough, can contribute to GERD. Micro-aspiration of gastric contents and/or vagal reflex induced bronchospasm might contribute to the association between GERD and COPD. In COPD, increased intra-abdominal pressure and negative intra-thoracic pressure, increased cough frequency, and medications may contribute to GERD. Despite the high prevalence of GERD in COPD and medications for GERD that have been shown to improve other pulmonary disease such as asthma, the etiological relationship between GERD and COPD has not been adequately elucidated.

Mediation analyses will be employed to examine the role of common SNPs associated with COPD and GERD identified using GWAS analysis on COPD as mediated by GERD.","Anticipated Findings
COPD is irreversible; however, improving our understanding of the etiology of comorbid GERD and COPD could serve to improve COPD diagnosis and treatment. This research will provide novel information regarding the mechanism of GERD in COPD pathogenesis and novel genetic markers that could be used as therapeutic targets or biomarkers to provide timely interventions. Future directions of this research will involve integrative ‘omics and functional genomic methods such as SNP enrichment, co-localization, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to investigate the role of significant findings in the mechanisms underlying GERD in COPD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are going to use the software GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) to estimate asthma heritability in Latinos and African Americans.  We will calculate the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) from all the autosomal SNPs.  We will then use restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and Haseman-Elston (HE) regression to estimate the variance explained by all SNPs.","Anticipated Findings
The heritability of asthma ranges between 35% and 95%.  Our results in Latino and African American will show the importance of the genetic factor in asthma in these 2 populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (substance use disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will examine the relationship between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and CRP by regressing CRP on the cannabis use measures in the All of Us dataset. All models will control for covariates including age, sex, race and BMI. We may construct additional models that covary for comorbid conditions such as depression or asthma. Additionally, we will examine demographic counts for the variables of interest in our study.","Anticipated Findings
We would anticipate to find an association between cannabis use and CRP levels, with cannabis use in the last three months being associated with lower CRP levels. On the other hand, we would expect to find that cannabis use disorder (or some other measure of heavy use) is associated with higher CRP levels. This project could help untangle how the relationship between cannabis use and CRP changes according to level of cannabis use. It may also give insight into whether this relationship is confounded by other conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease typically characterized by asymptomatic well-circumscribed patches of hair loss on the scalp or face. Recent work has shown that atopic disease appears to be more prevalent in Black patients than previous homogenous studies [PMID: 35104584] Here, we seek to further investigate the association of AA with atopic and autoimmune disease by performing a nested case-control study in the All of Us database. We hope to answer the question of whether or not having AA predisposes patients to a number of co-morbidities including asthma, acne, hyperlipidemia, and T1D and T2D.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (alopecia areata)","Scientific Approaches
We will collect data on comorbidities of patients with Alopecia areata. Then we will age/sex/race match the AA cases to create a non-AA control group. Once we collect data on the prevalence, we will use ODDS RATIO calculator to report data.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that patients with Alopecia Areata (AA) will have a more significant proability (Odds Ratio) of having select comorbidities as compared to the control cohort (no-AA).","Demographic Categories of Interest

This research is to evaluate the real-world use, switches, and discontinuations of biologics in the treatment of asthma. Although 6 biologics are currently approved for asthma treatment, relatively little is known about their real-world use and effectiveness. Additionally, there is some evidence that there may be inequitable use and access to these biologics. Furthermore, the patterns of use in individuals who are eligible for two or more of these biologics is currently unknown.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
Study population: individuals ≥18 years with diagnosis of asthma who were on any of the biologics approved for asthma treatment (omalizumab, benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, dupilumab) between 2005 to date. We will be using summary statistics in characterizing the incidence of initiation of these biologics, switches from one biologic to another (and when the switch occurred), and/or discontinuation. To evaluate if these switches were due to effectiveness of these biologics, we will evaluate asthma exacerbations while on the biologics. In addition, we will evaluate if these patterns differ by age, sex, or race and ethnicity.","Anticipated Findings
This study will improve our knowledge of real-world use and patterns of use of these biologics and can inform future studies and/or interventions in optimizing the benefits of these biologics.","Demographic Categories of Interest
