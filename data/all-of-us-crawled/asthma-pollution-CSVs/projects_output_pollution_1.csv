The specific scientific question I intend to study is: ""What is the association between air pollution and the incidence of lung cancer?"" This question is of paramount importance due to the increasing global burden of lung cancer and the growing evidence that air pollution plays a significant role in the etiology of respiratory diseases, including lung cancer. Understanding this association is critical for several reasons:
Public Health Impact: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Identifying and quantifying the role of air pollution in lung cancer development could lead to targeted public health interventions, policies for air quality improvement, and ultimately, a reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cancer)","Scientific Approaches
Datasets:
Air Quality Data: Sources could include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) database.
Health Outcomes Data: Acquire lung cancer incidence and mortality data from cancer registries. This data will include information on lung cancer cases, demographic variables (age, sex), and geographic location.
Covariate Data: Collect data on potential confounders and effect modifiers, including smoking rates, socio-economic status, and occupational exposures
Research Methods:
Exposure Assessment: Use  models to estimate individual or community-level exposure to air pollutants based on residential or workplace locations.
Epidemiological Analysis: Conduct observational studies, such as cohort or case-control studies, to assess the relationship between air pollution exposure and lung cancer risk. This will involve calculating relative risks, odds ratios, and attributable risks, adjusting for confounders.","Anticipated Findings
The study aims to identify a quantitative relationship between long-term exposure to specific air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2) and the incidence of lung cancer. Findings are expected to highlight the risk increase associated with certain levels of exposure.
Through spatial analysis, the research may uncover geographic patterns in the correlation between air pollution levels and lung cancer rates, identifying areas with elevated risks.
Public Health Policies: The findings will provide robust evidence to support the development of targeted public health policies and air quality standards aimed at reducing lung cancer incidence. This evidence can advocate for stricter air pollution controls and inform guidelines for safe exposure levels.
Environmental Justice: Identifying spatial hotspots and differential risks can contribute to the discourse on environmental justice, highlighting communities disproportionately affected by air pollution and prompting targeted interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Exposure to ambient air pollution and extreme temperature has significant consequences for human health and mortality. Behavioral responses to air pollution and temperature are of academic and public interest in and of themselves, but they can also reveal the social costs of pollution and extreme temperatures, or the benefits of their mitigation, informing cost-benefit analysis of environmental policy. This project aims to use wearables data from the All of Us project. to examine (1) how human behavior changes in response to pollution and temperature shocks and (2) mechanisms through which pollution and temperature affect human health and physical performance.","Project Purpose(s)

This study will provide a novel approach to valuing pollution avoidance and climate change mitigation, contributing to a growing literature in environmental economics. Whereas much of the existing literature identifies health impacts for vulnerable populations like infants and the elderly, populations for which relevant data are available from administrative records, these wearables data can be used to analyze impacts on other demographic groups, including non-elderly adults.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or stillbirth, is defined in the US as death ≥20 weeks gestation and occurs in about 1 in 160 pregnancies (CDC). Numerous medical risk factors have been identified as contributing to stillbirth, as have several social determinants, such as race, income, education, access to antenatal cate, air pollution, and drug use.  There is a paucity of literature examining the association of social determinants of health on IUFD as well as the impact social determinants of health have on stillbirth evaluation. Previous literature has shown placental pathology, fetal autopsy, and genetic testing identified as the most useful in determining stillbirth cause. However, little data analyzing whether socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are receiving these recommended evaluations exists. This study seeks to examine the social, racial, and economic factors that may be contributing to stillbirth as well as the role these determinants may have on stillbirth evaluation.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral

Previously performed cross-sectional study using institutional data were used to develop a predictive model for stillbirth. Use of information obtained using the All of Us dataset will be used to help validate our model. Additional data on social determinants of health among women experiencing stillbirth  will be analyzed, as well as any existing genetic data for these cases.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate findings demonstrating an impact for social determinants of health on the occurrence of stillbirth as well the evaluation performed thereafter. This study offers a benefit to the medical community in that it may allow for more complete understanding of the factors influencing intrauterine fetal demise leading to better and more equitable prenatal care, delivery planning, and genetic evaluation for patients with a history of intrauterine fetal demise.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Previous studies have shown that living somewhere with high levels of air pollution makes it more likely that a person will develop asthma. While in the long term we need to decrease air pollution levels nationwide, we urgently need ways to protect people exposed to air pollution. To do this, we need to understand how being exposed to air pollution leads to asthma. Knowing which genetic variants make a person more likely to develop asthma when they are exposed to air pollution can help us with this. First, because it may show us which people are especially at risk and therefor allow us to target these people with screening or public health interventions and second, because these genetic variants may point to certain biological processes that we can then target with medications.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan on using data from the Environmental Protection Agency to determine which people live in areas with high levels of air pollution. In this group of people, we plan on comparing the genetic variants between people with asthma and people without asthma.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to validate genetic variants that have been previously linked with developing asthma when exposed to air pollution and discover new variants. This may help us define at risk populations and therapeutic targets. Given the inequitable distribution of air pollution exposure in the United States, protecting exposed populations from the effects of air pollution may help reduce asthma inequities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Epidemiological evidence has shown climate change (including extreme heat and elevated temperature) and air pollution have adverse effects on population health, especially cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases. However, there is limited information on individual susceptibility to climate change and air pollution in terms of genetic variant, lifestyle and behavior factors. The overall aim of this project is to investigate how climate change, air pollution and lifestyle are affecting cardiometabolic diseases among representative US population in the All of US program. First, we will investigate how climate-related extreme events and air pollution together impact cardiometabolic disease incidence and mortality. Second, we will examine whether lifestyle and behavior information modify the impact of environmental factor on cardiometabolic health. Third, we will leverage genetic variant and assess individual susceptibility.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiometabolic disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will match All of US participants' location with spatial-temporal datasets containing air pollution, extreme heat and temperature exposure and link diseases incidence and mortality EMR datasets in All of US database. Epidemiological analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of air pollution and climate change on cardiometabolic health incidence and mortality. We will additional explore using Fitbit data as an indicator of the individual behavior and test whether it can be used as an indicator of climate adaptation. Lastly, we will conduct statistical analysis testing genetic variant of cardiometabolic susceptibility during high air pollution period and/or during heatwave events.","Anticipated Findings
For the first aim, we anticipated that we found that air pollution and heat exposure is associated with higher incidence and mortality of the cardiometabolic diseases. For the second aim, we anticipated that we found increased physical activity could reduce adverse impact of air pollution and extreme heat exposure. For the third aim, we anticipated to replicate some of the previously identified genetic variants that are susceptible markers of the cardiometabolic diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 80 million people. The exact mechanisms of glaucoma development remain unclear, but oxidative stress, inflammatory pathways,  and microvascular changes have been shown to play an important role. The same mechanisms have been linked to air pollution and recent studies have shown that greater exposure of air pollutants are associated with both self-reported glaucoma and adverse structural characteristics of the disease. A better understanding of the association between glaucoma and air pollution, can help identify modifiable risk factors and, hopefully, provide actionable advice for patients and health care professionals to improve glaucoma management.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (glaucoma)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct an epidemiological study. To reflect chronic exposure, we will assess data from participants who have responded to The Basics survey question “How many years have you lived at your current address?” with either “6 to 10” or “11 to 20 or “more 20”. Cases of glaucoma will be identified using SNOMED-CT. To assess exposure of air pollutants, we will use publicly available government sources obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). We will match to the nearest location of measurement for each environmental variable to assign each patient a single set of environmental measurements. We will use logistic regression models to quantify the association of environmental variables with our primary outcome of glaucoma.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to obtain novel insights to increase our understanding of the relationship between greater exposure to air pollutants, and other environmental factors, and the risk of glaucoma. Using ""All of Us"" data, we hope to contribute new knowledge that can potentially identify new modifiable risk factors for glaucoma.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The world has witnessed on-going urbanization and globalization for decades.  Currently, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and the proportion is expected to go up to about 66% by 2050.  The number of people living outside their country of origin has also been increasing over the last two decades.   This global trend is evident in largest cities in the world such as New York, suggesting rapid and extensive admixture of individuals with different ancestry inside the city. This admixture is different from the admixture we experienced before in many points. Thus, it is important to understand what would happen in our genome in the city from the perspective of population genetics.
Additionally, the environment in urban area is very unique: E.g. high density of people, heavy traffic, heavy air pollution, low level of physical activity and etc. These unique environment can drive evolution though gene environment interaction.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To assess what genetic features in cities are different from those in rural areas,  we will categorize All Of US participants by the level of urbanization based on zip code data and compare several statistics (e.g. genetic diversity). To understand what is happening in a large city, we will analyze population structure in New York City by PCA, ADMIXTURE, UMAP and IBD sharing network and compare with New York States. We will also infer local ancestry for each individual using MOSAIC and gnomix to compare ancestry composition in each individual's genome.","Anticipated Findings
By analyzing NYC participants, we will find several founder populations and many recently admixed individuals. By combining EHR data, we will be able to find population-specific disease and associated variants. This may improve our understanding of disease background for underrepresented populations such as admixed populations and small founder populations.
Higher genetic diversity and higher rate of assortative mating are anticipated in the city than rural area. Our findings may be helpful to create future frameworks of genomic study such as Genome-wide association study (GWAS) because some genetic features like assortative mating would contradict the assumption of current framework.
Inferring local ancestry is important for finding disease-associated variants in admixed individuals. We will provide the results to other researchers to enhance genetic researches in admixed populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are interested generally in risk factors for developing autoimmune diseases, in particular but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, at the population level. We are interested in environmental risk factors (air pollution, heat, pesticides, etc.), psychosocial factors (stress, emotional distress, trauma, PTSD, depression, resilience), social determinants of health (access to food, work, housing, neighborhood factors) , and behavioral lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, exercise, obesity, diet, work hours, etc.). We are interested in characterizing the sociodemographics of the populations affected and estimating the population attributable risk for each of these factors and in combinations.  When genome-wide data are available, we will be interested in genetic risk factors for autoimmune diseases, and how they may interact with environmental risk factors to produce immune dysregulation and then disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to assemble cohorts of individuals with incident and prevalent autoimmune diseases (concentrating on SLE and RA, but also investigating other related autoimmune diseases) and matched controls to investigate the prevalence of these risk factors, populations most affected, magnitude of the risk estimates and population attributable risks.

We have previously studied many of these risk factors, and their interactions with genetic factors, among women in the prospective Nurses' Health Study and to an extent in the Black Women's Health Study,  the Women's Health Study, and Roxbury Lupus Study. These studies have all been limited to females, had mainly older adult participants, and have had limited racial and ethnic diversity. For these reasons, we aim to confirm and extend our research into more diverse population-based cohorts and expect that all of these factors will be associated with risk of these autoimmune diseases. We intend to examine the  magnitudes of effects observed and the population attributable risks. These studies will contribute greatly to our knowledge of autoimmune disease risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, and potential pathogenesis of these complex diseases, in diverse US populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Exposure to ambient air pollution and extreme temperature has significant consequences for human health and mortality. Behavioral responses to air pollution and temperature are of academic and public interest in and of themselves, but they can also reveal the social costs of pollution and extreme temperatures, or the benefits of their mitigation, informing cost-benefit analysis of environmental policy. This project aims to use wearables data from the All of Us project. to examine (1) how human behavior changes in response to pollution and temperature shocks and (2) mechanisms through which pollution and temperature affect human health and physical performance.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
This project will use econometric and causal inference tools common in applied microeconomics research to explore behavioral responses to ambient air pollution and extreme temperature. It will incorporate publicly available weather and temperature data as well as pollution data from local pollution monitors as and satellite measures.","Anticipated Findings
This study will provide a novel approach to valuing pollution avoidance and climate change mitigation, contributing to a growing literature in environmental economics. Whereas much of the existing literature identifies health impacts for vulnerable populations like infants and the elderly, populations for which relevant data are available from administrative records, these wearables data can be used to analyze impacts on other demographic groups, including non-elderly adults.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities exist widely in the breast cancer outcomes (incidence, survival, and quality-of-life). When compared with white women, African American women have higher recurrence and death rates from breast cancer although they have a lower incidence rate. It is well established that both community and individual level risk factors play important roles in the breast cancer outcomes.
We will take advantage of the comprehensive database collected by the All of Us project to investigate the observed racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes. Using the novel multilevel mediation analysis method, we will identify modifiable factors that can explain the racial disparities observed in breast cancer outcomes. The risk factors to be considered include measures at both the environmental (e.g. pollution measurements) and individual levels (e.g., smoking behavior and gene expressions).","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will identify important genes and investigate their relative contribution in breast cancer progression to determine how the neighborhood environment interacts with gene expressions, leading to their alteration in different racial groups and thus influencing associated racial health disparities. All female participants who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will be included for analysis. We will also entail cross-sectional data analysis of multilevel data, nesting individual gene expression data in neighborhoods, to analyze the competing risks of the neighborhood environment for breast cancer. As described in the AoU data dictionary, participants’ residential addresses were geo-coded and the socio-economic status of the residential address are linked to patients according to the zip codes.  We have generated neighborhood risk factors from public-available datasets and will link the neighborhood risk factors with each participant. We will use the mediation analysis method.","Anticipated Findings
A clear understanding of the etiologic factors underlying health disparities is essential for designing screenings, treatments and interventions for optimally reducing disparities. The multilevel statistical methods developed through the project can help explain a wide array of health disparities. We will test the use of AoU database to investigate its potential of helping generate and test hypothesis that aims at ultimately filling in knowledge gaps and improving biomedical and epidemiological research in health disparities.","Demographic Categories of Interest
