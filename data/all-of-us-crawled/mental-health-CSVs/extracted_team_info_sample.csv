Main goal: To develop an effective approach to identify unique genetic and clinical profiles for characterizing different skin conditions.
Aim 1: Catalog the molecular/biomedical information available on skin diseases and then investigate its potential for understanding the impact of diseases in terms of their environmental factors, comorbidities, drug prescriptions, mental health and mobility.
Aim 2: Identifying the unique genetic determinants of skin diseases and their prognosis by comparing the alleles for genetic markers in these patients with controls. Understanding how these unique determinants are shared with other human disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (skin disease)","Scientific Approaches
Although epidemiological and genetic studies have been conducted to reveal distinct clinical and molecular features for different skin conditions (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, etc.), the identification of shared and unique disease components has been challenged by the lack of large population-based studies. Over the past five years, large biobanks are being established, which instead of focusing on a specific disease, invest vast effort to collect detailed clinical and molecular information from the general population. These population-level biobanks can significantly extend the application and translation of findings by providing resources to unravel the factors shaping the diversity of different disease conditions. The patients in the Biobank with a wide range of skin diseases and the diverse range of information provided will be useful for understanding the overall burden of cutaneous disorders.","Anticipated Findings
Our aim is to provide detailed population characteristics for skin diseases in the Biobank, along with information about newly identified environmental factors and genetic risk variants. We will share our findings with the research community through publications and in open-source platform.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genome-wide association studies of mental health conditions have identified variants that contribute to a small portion of the total disorder variance. While these data have been useful in identifying novel genetic associations, in large part these data have not been used predict risk of disease. Our hope is to leverage the All of Us data to estimate disease effect estimates for multiple mental health conditions in diverse populations. Specific questions include: (1) what are the most significant non-genetic and genetic factors in association with serious mental illnesses? (2) How can we combine both clinical risk factors and genomic risk scores to predict mental health conditions? We hypothesize that a risk model incorporating both non-genetic and genetic factors will have better power to explain and predict mental health conditions. This study will develop and evaluate end-to-end predictive models for mental health phenotype in diverse groups.  Phase-3 will focus on HLA region.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will cover all eligible participants with different background in All of Us. First, self-reported surveys (e.g., lifestyle and medical history) and electronic health records (EHR) will be used to determine serious mental illness cases and their matched controls. Exposure variables will be assessed and harmonized across resources; and pre-processed for missing value and outliers. Second, disease risk factors will then be interrogated by regularized regression (non-genetic) and genome-wide association test (genetic). Third, clinical risk score and genomic risk score will be constructed by weighted sum of significant risk factors retained, and then combined by logistic regression and random forest. Fourth, a set of candidate risk models will be validated and then optimized in prospective sample, via C statistics and other diagnostic metrics. The whole framework will also be repeated in stratified samples so as to tune the parameters for specific groups (e.g., age, sex, and race).","Anticipated Findings
Findings from this project would identify novel genetic biomarkers and establish a predictive model to classify individuals at different risk for developing serious mental illness. We expect to find: (1) significant clinical/social factors and biomarkers that are associated with focused diseases; (2) polygenic risk scores tailored for overall population and different subgroups; (3) risk model comprised of non-genetic risk factors and polygenic risk scores. We also anticipate some risk factors may present different effect sizes across populations. There is a need to revise risk model in general population to increase its performance in specific group. However, those difference observed across populations may be caused by social determinants, instead of biology; and some of them may be not well covered in All of Us. We will mitigate the potential stigmatization risk of our models in future publications and presentations by providing more discussion on its benefit and limitation.","Demographic Categories of Interest

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. What proportion of adults in the dataset identify as a sexual minority and autistic, and what is the prevalence of co-occurring mental health conditions among autistic sexual minority adults?
2. What associations exist between social determinants of health and the health and health care access of autistic sexual minority adults?
3. What associations exist between social determinants of health and the mental health and emotional wellbeing of autistic sexual minority adults?
RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Growing research suggests that a higher proportion of autistic people are sexual and gender minority (SGM) but little is known about their healthcare needs. Research suggests that autistic adults have worse health/mental health outcomes than their allistic peers and that SGM adults have worse health/mental health outcomes than their cisgender and heterosexual peers, but few studies have explored outcomes for autistic sexual minority adults specifically.","Project Purpose(s)

Injuries are not created equal; groups experience injuries at different rates. Aging US population yields increases in falls, but assaultive injuries shouldered by Black or African American patients, work related injuries shouldered by Hispanic/Latinx patients. Historic and ongoing systemic racism has led to modern segregation and inequities across the country that may drive injury disparities. Most injuries are preventable and present a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy. At the individual level injuries confer risk for poor mental and physical health, lower quality of life, increased financial and economic burden. Risk for poor mental health after injury may be impacted by various factors such as mechanism of injury and prior or current exposures to stress. Disproportionate exposure to injury can therefore differentially impact health and quality of life.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I plan to generate a cohort of participants with a history of injury or traumatic injury. I'm interested in understanding the differential distribution of past injuries by demographic characteristics as well as to compare quality of life measures (both biological and self-reported physical and mental health) between those who've experienced injury and those who have not. I plan to use descriptive statistics and regression approaches to examine relationships among injury patterns and quality of life at the individual and neighborhood level.","Anticipated Findings
This study will extend current literature describing the deleterious effects of injury on physical and mental health as well as the effects of the environment on exposure to injury and subsequent impacts on health and quality of life. By utilization of a unique and highly powered national dataset, findings will provide a comprehensive description of how injury is impacting different communities at the national level and provide potential targets for intervention at the individual level to improve health and quality of life for injury survivors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research question: What is the relationship between chronic pain and hip and waist circumference? Can hip and waist circumference be used as predictors of chronic pain onset and burden? Are hip and waist circumferences accurate and reliable indicators of chronic pain?
Chronic pain is among the most common morbidities globally, afflicting 1.71 billion people globally with an estimated prevalence of 50.2 million adults in the US alone. Living with a chronic pain condition has been associated with a detrimental impact on a patient’s mental health, sleep habits, and physical state. Thus, understanding potential risk factors can help reduce the prevalence of chronic pain and help create preventative measures.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Our chronic pain research aims to identify and investigate measures that can prevent or minimize the occurrence of chronic pain conditions, diseases, or adverse events. We aim to understand the risk factors of hip and waist circumference, and any underlying mechanisms, and help aid the creation of effective strategies to prevent the onset or progression of chronic pain. Additionally, we aim to educate others on the correlation between chronic pain and hip and waist circumference. )","Scientific Approaches
Our approach to the study will require examining the various demographic factors related to pain and hip/waist circumference. We intend to include subjects 18 years or older in this study, however, we have no exclusion criteria for other demographics for this study. Other variables documented will include numerical rating scale numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, specific diagnoses made in relation to pain, medications taken, and pain severity. By noting these factors, we hope to use correlation analysis to determine the relationship between chronic pain and hip/waist circumference.","Anticipated Findings
Our study is aiming to explore the correlation between hip/waist circumference to chronic pain. We anticipate that our data collection will show these measurements to serve as a more precise and accurate link to chronic pain compared to the current standard, which is BMI. By improving the markers of chronic pain, we believe that we can further manage individuals by creating a more transparent depiction of individuals with pain. By minimizing false positives and negatives in screening for pain, we hope to effectively portray the chronic pain population. Creating a stronger correlation to chronic pain will create a more concrete understanding of individuals with pain, reducing any incorrect classifications made with BMI. By understanding the population to a greater degree, it will become more feasible to analyze and assess for the best ways to manage pain.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We propose to study if there are any measurable differences between deaf, Deaf, or Hard of Hearing (d/DHH) patients and hearing patients with respect to mental health treatment. As primary goal, we are interested in how doctors treat the d/DHH patients with medication compared to hearing people. Evidence suggests that d/DHH patients have a greater health burden compared to hearing people. Of particular concern, d/DHH who have mental health disorders including bipolar, major depressive disorder, and PTSD  (with or without  diagnoses) face barriers to proper treatment such as:
- Language barriers
- Lack of interpreters who understands medical background / literacy
- Discrimination
- Lack of counselors / psychologists who has knowledge about Deaf culture and ASL

**Scientific Question**
How do sociodemographic factors (such as gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status), depression, anxiety, and alcohol or other drug use differ between individuals who initiate cannabis use at age 21 compared to those who initiate at the more typical age of 14-16?
**Importance**
This study is primarily concerned with the etiology of drug use disorders: The current literature on cannabis and associated mental health, social, and economic problems in the United States is almost entirely based on a prior legal environment in which cannabis was illegal everywhere. Now that there is a patchwork of different legal conditions, we can finally gain some insight into how much of these associated problems are due to the use of cannabis itself, vs the need to operate within an illegal market with all of the associated social ties and associations that develop as a result. The results of the study will have important implications for cannabis policy in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

**Research Methods**
Latent Class Analysis (LCA): A statistical method used to identify underlying subgroups (latent classes) within a population based on observed variables. In this study, LCA will be used to identify subgroups of individuals with similar sociodemographic characteristics, depression, anxiety, and substance use patterns.

- Python (e.g., `mclust` package in R): Alternatively, the `mclust` package in R or other similar packages in Python can be used for latent class analysis.","Anticipated Findings
Overall, the study may reveal complex relationships between age of cannabis initiation, legal status, and the problem behaviors we typically associate with Cannabis use, such as increased depression and suicidality and other drug use and drug use disorders, highlighting the importance of considering the legal environment and age of first use of cannabis. These findings could have major implications for understanding the etiology of drug use disorders if cannabis users in legal environments, across ages, do not progress to have the same types of drug use patterns apparent in the cannabis users who initiate in illegal settings.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The dataset would be from participants with identified medical records before the age of 18. The cohort then would be divided into two groups of: those who had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and those who do not. With each group, we will then look at the risk ratio of common NCD such as hypertension, Type II DM, and hyperlipidemia. Looking at the geographic data of the participants will help our team understand the access to care that those participants may have had.","Anticipated Findings
Early diagnosis of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety will lead to worse health outcomes due to the multifaceted effects of mental health disorders, impacting other domains of life such as livelihood and relationship building. The study's results can help urge the need for more mental health services for the youth.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The AoU program integrated self-reported survey data (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and sex assigned at birth) with EHR data (including gender identity disorder [GID]-related ICD code and medication information), physical measurements and biospecimens to create a data repository. This allows us to explore SOGI disparities in mental health outcomes using diverse and large volunteer cohorts from different sources. Despite existing computable phenotype algorithms to detect HIV cases from AoU, there is a lack of standardization regarding detecting SGMs in the AoU platform for SOGI-related analyses. Integrating multiple datatypes (e.g., self-reported information and EHR data) from AoU, this study aims to develop computable phenotype algorithms for gender minority cases and explore the psychiatric diagnosis among them.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will define suspected gender minorties using a combination of EHR and survey data. In the EHR data, we used transgender/gender nonbinary diagnosis code (ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes) in the “condition occurrence” table and gender affirming medications in the “drug exposure” table, and transgender related surgery in ""procedure"" table.  In addition to EHR, we identified gender minorities using responses to two survey questions, including: (1) “What was your biological sex assigned at birth?” (responses include female and male); and (2) “What terms best express how you describe your gender identity?” (Responses include woman, man, non-binary, transgender, and additional options). Participants whose responses to gender identity were not “woman”/“man” or there were incongruences in their sex assigned at birth and gender identity were considered as “gender minority.”","Anticipated Findings
Through exploring the phenotyping algorithm of gender identity disorder (GID) and the intersection effects of race, gender identity, and sexual orientation on their mental health.

Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The cohort we will be utilizing will be participants 18 and older, adults, from a variety of backgrounds. Within our cohort we will have two subgroups. One group containing individuals with hypertension and one without hypertension.
We will most likely be using the following surveys from the Research All of Us Workbench: The Basics; Lifestyle; Overall Health; Social Determinants of Healt; and Emotional Health and Wellbeing.
Using RStudio, we will first code to stratify by gender, race, ethnicity, and economic status. We will then use code to analyze anxiety disorders and depressive episodes. Then, patient provider relationship, chronic stress, and factors of discrimination. Second, we are going to code for characteristics and connections regarding adherence. This may include different types of treatment plans, mental health, and efficacy of treatment plans.","Anticipated Findings
Using our findings from an 18 source literature review, we anticipate:
Higher access to health care, rates of health literacy, and income will increase hypertension treatment efficacy and decrease mental health affects.

Globally, Black and U.S. Latina/o/x populations suffer disproportionately from  psychiatric disorders, such as psychotic disorders, compared to White Americans regardless of socioeconomic status. This is largely due to systemic racism, which has been deemed a fundamental cause of health care inequities. Yet few empirical studies have directly investigated the social determinants of psychiatric disorders, while also examining the impact of these determinants on the human genome (epigenetics). Theoretical emphasis has highlighted the importance of studying the confluence of biological and social factors on psychosis. The aim of this study is to initiate an interdisciplinary microbiome study integrating bioinformatics and social determinants of mental health using data from the recent NIH-sponsored All of Us Research Program, while building a sustain able mentored student research project","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The main research objective is to identify the microbiome signature associated with psychosis and determine if psychosis-associated microbiota vary by social determinants of health such as neighborhood quality, deprivation, and cohesion. We will use the All of Us database to elucidate exposure to racial discrimination in Black and Latinx individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders and those not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders, then use the AnVIL platform to compare microbiotic genetic profiles in these populations.  Interaction terms in the regression models between genomic data and social determinant and discrimination measure scores will be created to determine the degree to which joint combinations predict probability of psychotic disorders. All models will covary key demographic factors such as sex, gender, and age.","Anticipated Findings
The research findings will contribute to a body of knowledge that can improve disease prevention strategies and health care treatment in two communities (Black and Latina/o/x) that have been historically medically underserved. It will represent the first time, to our knowledge, that this type of innovative interdisciplinary research connecting genomic research with social determinants of health focused specifically on Black and Latinx health has occurred. The research collaboration between faculty and students at CCNY and Guttman Community College also marks a novel interdisciplinary research model, with both four-year and two-year undergraduate students contributing equally to a research project that has the potential to shape how the scientific community understands mental health disorders.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We propose to explore the issue of phenotypically heterogenous groupings in bipolar disorder within the AURP cohort by use of clinical and genetic measures. Relevant clinical variables include: medication history (e.g., use of lithium or other mood stabilizers), treatment history (e.g., contact with mental health professionals), and comorbidity (e.g., suicidal behavior, alcohol use disorder). Genetically, relevant variables can be derived from summary statistics produced by GWAS of BD and related disorders. In general, we expect that participants who report a history of BD supported by typical clinical history will carry an increased burden of BD risk alleles compared to participants who report BD without a supporting clinical history. Existing GWAS also provide excellent benchmarks for heritability estimated from genetic relationships (“SNP heritability”). Thus this study aims to identify clinical and genetic features that may define distinct subsets of individuals who report BD.","Project Purpose(s)

Defined subsets will then be carried forward to genetic analyses where SNP array data will be used to calculate polygenic risk scores and SNP heritabilities for each candidate subset. Relevant tools include PLINK, PRSice, and GCTA. Since AURP comprises a rich diversity of study participants, interaction effects with regard to demographic variables will also be considered.","Anticipated Findings
Results from this study will provide novel insight into genotype-phenotype relationships across the broad spectrum of BD. Unlike case-control studies, which are biased toward more severe, treatment-recieving cases, diverse, population-based cohorts like AURP, provide a more representative sample that is expected to provide a new perspective on the genetic architecture of BD and related disorders.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My questions are:
What are the specific genetic markers influencing SSRI responsiveness?
How can decision tree ensemble models be effectively utilized to measure the importance of input features in the context of SSRI responsiveness?
What is the impact of whole-genome sequencing information in uncovering genetic determinants of SSRI response compared to limited subset analyses?
How can the identified genetic determinants be translated into personalized medication recommendations for individuals with affective disorders?
The relevance of these questions to science and public health lies in the potential to enhance the understanding of individual variability in SSRI responses, leading to more targeted and effective treatment strategies for individuals with affective disorders. The research aims to contribute valuable insights into the genetic basis of SSRI responsiveness, offering a pathway towards more personalized approaches to medication in mental health treatment.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Here are my approaches:
1. Data Acquisition: From the All of Us database, extract data on patients with affective disorders who've been exposed to SSRI medications. Focus on those with whole-genome sequencing information.
2. Model Implementation: Use decision tree ensemble models, which can measure the importance of input features. While these models traditionally rank the significance of SNP/Indel variants, our approach aims to pinpoint essential genomic locations
influencing SSRI efficacy.
3. Feature Importance Analysis: Analyze the trained model to reveal crucial genetic determinants of SSRI response. This step will help identify genetic markers with the most influence on medication responsiveness.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are:
Identification of Specific Genetic Markers, Insights into Genomic Locations, Validation of Decision Tree Ensemble Models, Comparison with Limited Subset Analyses, Potential for Personalized Medication Recommendations.
While SSRIs are common treatments for affective disorders, patient responses vary significantly. Current methods for recommending SSRIs based on genomic information are limited, analyzing only a subset of genes. With whole-genome sequencing becoming more accessible, there's potential to harness the entire genetic sequence for insights which can contribute to more personalized medications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How do SDOH influence individuals' mental well-being in the context of a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic?
Our primary objective is to accurately pinpoint individuals who are most susceptible to experiencing mental health issues based on specific social determinants of health. These determinants include but are not limited to, the safety of the neighborhood they live in, social support that they receive from their peers, discrimination that they may be subjected to, loneliness, and food insecurity. By identifying these factors, we can proactively anticipate and provide support to individuals at the highest risk of experiencing mental health challenges, especially during critical periods of vulnerability, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project seeks to uplift and empower vulnerable communities, acknowledging the importance of a collective and compassionate response to mental health challenges in the face of adversity.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Mental Health)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
Our approach involves a multi-step process to investigate how social determinants of health (SDoH) contribute to the worsening of mental health during a public health crisis. First, we will conduct a detailed descriptive data analysis to better understand the information and its characteristics. This will involve examining various factors that are available for participants, such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and SDoH. After completing the descriptive analysis, we will implement linear mixed models to identify individuals at high risk of poor mental health outcomes overall and over time during the pandemic. Specifically, we will explore the relationship between these waves, SDoH, and mental health outcomes. This will allow us to better understand the impact of the pandemic on mental health and identify factors that may be contributing or aggravating to mental health decline.","Anticipated Findings
Our hypothesis is that social determinants of health (SDoH) have a significant impact on mental health, and that the effect is not limited to a single SDoH factor. Instead, we expect to see that a combination of these factors can contribute to the decline of participants' mental health. These factors may include socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, education, employment, housing, and social support. By analyzing the data collected, we hope to gain a better understanding of how multiple SDoH factors interact and affect mental health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to assess the differences in care for patients aged 18 and over who were diagnosed with mental health/substance use disorders across different genders. This question is important because oftentimes discrimination against those with mental illness or substance use in healthcare settings can result in delayed diagnosis, referral to treatment, and recovery for mental and substance use problems, as well as other health conditions. The All of Us survey allows us to estimate the occurrence of and correlates of perceiving frequent discrimination in healthcare settings from a large national sample of patients.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Data from a subsample of participants in the All of Us study who completed the Social Determinants of Health and the Personal and Family Health History surveys were analyzed. Perceived discrimination in healthcare settings was assessed by asking participants “How often do any of these happen to you when you go to a doctor’s office or other health care provider?” Multivariable logistic regression models with a sex*history of mental health interaction term were conducted to estimate average marginal effects of perceiving frequent discrimination across categories of biological sex at birth and prior mental health history. Wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted to estimate sex differences in marginal effects for those with and without a history of a mental health or substance use disorder and differences in the sex gap for those with a with and without a history of a mental health or substance use disorder. Analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.2 Patched on Jupyter notebook.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find differences in the treatment of mental health/substance use disorders depending on the gender of the patient. These findings are intended to highlight the unconscious and conscious bias that exists in the treatment of mental health/substance use disorders among people of different genders. Hopefully, the results of the study will demonstrate the need for new approaches to mental healthcare to improve treatment and care for all patients and ensure that they all receive quality care, regardless of their gender. Identifying population groups that face a higher risk of discrimination within healthcare settings, is pivotal for tailoring education programs aimed at healthcare professionals. This program can equip them with the knowledge and sensitivity needed to interact effectively with diverse patient populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Educational","Scientific Approaches
This review aims to determine if there are statistically significant rates of new-onset anxiety and depression diagnoses after COVID-19 infection among All of Us Research Program participants. Our project uses EHR-derived diagnoses of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression from the conditions domain as well as COVID-19 diagnoses from the labs and measurements domain. Our analysis also incorporates demographic and socioeconomic variables from participant-provided survey data. Data cleaning was performed in Python, and logistic regression was performed in R to evaluate the association between COVID-19 infection and these mental health conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Anxiety and depression are known comorbidities, however their relationship with viral infections including COVID-19 is not fully clear. It is common for patients to experience anxiety or depression when diagnosed with COVID-19, however even after full recovery, patients can remain anxious or depressed. This may be due to any number of factors, including long isolation after recovery. Depression is implicated in immune system suppression, and can complicate recovery from viral infections including COVID-19. Depression has also been identified as a possible neuropsychiatric consequence of COVID-19. However, the relationship between COVID-19 infection and its direct link with anxiety and depression is still being studied. COVID-19 survivors are at elevated risk for suicide due to the presence of depression after recovery.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Sexual minority (SM) women are an understudied population, although they face unique stressors including stigma, discrimination, and violence. Compared to straight women, SM women experience increased risks for depression, mental distress, heart disease, and tension or worry. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, people worldwide are facing a confluence of factors that contribute to mental health challenges, including risk of disease and death from COVID-19, loss of loved ones, decreased social contact, and employment loss. Science would benefit from studying how SM women are faring in this context and some protective factors that may be helpful.
This study's research questions are:
1. How is the overall mental health of SM women related to COVID-specific stressors (stress from social distancing and COVID-specific thought patterns and anxieties)?
2. Which social factors and coping behaviors act as protective factors for SM women’s mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Project Purpose(s)

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), encompassing conditions like stroke and heart attack, remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While traditional risk factors such as diet, exercise, and genetics are well-documented, the potential impact of novel environmental exposures, particularly lithium and pesticides, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge presents an urgent need for comprehensive research to understand these relationships better.
This research is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses a relatively unexplored area of environmental health. Understanding the role of lithium, commonly found in water supplies and used in various industries, and pesticides, widely used in agriculture, in the development of heart attacks and strokes could be significant in reducing the global burden of these diseases. Furthermore, this study could inform policy makers, guiding regulations on environmental exposures and public health advisories.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cerebrovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The study will employ an epidemiological approach, analyzing data from diverse populations to establish correlations between CVD incidence and levels of lithium and pesticide exposure. This will involve detailed environmental assessments, comprehensive medical histories, and possibly biomarker analyses to accurately quantify exposure levels. Advanced statistical methods will be used to control for confounding variables, ensuring the validity of the findings.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study could range from establishing a clear correlation between these novel exposures and increased CVD risk, to identifying no significant relationship. In cases where a positive association is found, the results could pave the way for further research into mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic interventions, and targeted public health strategies. Even in the absence of a significant association, the findings would be valuable in ruling out these exposures as major risk factors, refining the focus for future CVD research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) will be used to compare the All of Us genetic data by creating polygenic risk scores (PRS) that can be used to predict psychiatric disorders within the All of Us dataset. The PRSs will be based on the larger GWAS studies by sampling and clustering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS), and creating a specific PRS based on the psychiatric disorder of interest through the All of Us data. Regressions will be run on these PRSs and will be used to predict psychiatric disorders based on the All of Us participants' available psychiatric data. Covariates like family history, age, and sex of participants will be accounted for. Moderation analysis will examine any interaction effects between genetic risk and environmental factors, such as social support.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find that each of the disorder specific polygenic risk scores will significantly predict higher rates of diagnosed psychiatric disorders. We predict that each of the PRSs will be predicative for each of the psychiatric disorders in the study. We predict that there will be a buffering effect when higher social support is present. Due to the quantity and quality of the All of Us data, these findings would expand our scientific knowledge on the etiology of psychiatric disorders, how they interact with the environment, and the predictive validity of polygenic risk scores.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. What are the key risk factors associated with postpartum depression (PPD) in racial minorities such as previous psychiatric history, social support, and socioeconomic status?
Understanding specific risk factors for postpartum depression that racial minorities experience is crucial for the development of culturally competent care and resources that can target unique inequalities or factors that may lead to poor maternal mental health outcomes.
2. Can predictive models be developed based on the identified risk factors to effectively identify women of racial minority at higher risk of postpartum depression?
Developing predictive models can enhance the understanding of risk factors that women of racial minority may experience and place them at an elevated risk of postpartum depression. This has significant implications for public health as it enables targeted interventions and support resources for individuals with possible unique risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (The data will be used by a non-profit entity for research publication. The purpose is to publish a manuscript on a poorly researched topic on racial minorities to better understand socioeconomic risk factors for postpartum depression.)","Scientific Approaches
The study will use quantitative methods. Firstly, a comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify existing knowledge on risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD). Quantitative analysis will involve the utilization of datasets, encompassing racial minority demographic information, mental health, and clinical variables related to women's health. Statistical methods, such as logistic regression, will be applied to assess the significance of identified risk factors and their interactions in PPD development. Additionally, machine learning algorithms will be employed to develop predictive models. Data analysis will be facilitated through statistical software and programming languages like R or Python. The interdisciplinary nature of this study aims to provide a holistic understanding of PPD, facilitating the development of targeted interventions and predictive models to identify and support women at higher risk.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings from the study include the identification of specific risk factors in women of racial minority associated with postpartum depression (PPD) and an understanding of how these factors interact in its development. The development of predictive models is expected to enhance the accuracy of identifying women at higher risk. Some risk factors that are anticipated to place women of racial minority at increased risk for PPD are lack of social support, lack of access to mental health services, and socioeconomic stressors. The study aims to contribute significantly to the scientific knowledge in the field by pinpointing specific risk factors for women of a racial minority. The development of predictive models enables the potential identification of high-risk individuals with the purpose of early support to reduce the risk of developing PPD.

Strabismus describes misalignment of the eyes and affects about 4% of the U.S. population. Strabismus in children and adults can be caused by a variety of conditions, such as neuromuscular disorders, trauma, and stroke.

The secondary analysis aim is to see how socioeconomic and demographic variables may act as predictors for a strabismus diagnosis. Finally, we will examine the demographic data of individuals with amblyopia of any cause. Our methods would include multivariable logistic regression to identify associated variables.

While strabismus is linked to reductions in quality of life, this association has not been well explored within the All of Us database yet. The All of Us database has the advantages of a more representative/diverse participant cohort, and the comprehensive data on diagnoses, social determinants, and questionnaire results will allow us to better characterize the relationship between strabismus and mental health measures while controlling for confounders. We expect to see higher levels of depression and anxiety in individuals with a strabismus diagnosis, even after controlling for confounding variables. Additionally, we expect that socioeconomic status and demographic variables will be associated with a strabismus diagnosis.

Despite evidence that postpartum depression (PDD) has lasting negative outcomes for affected women, and their families alike, there is a gross lack of research to enhance clinical care for women’s mental health. The purpose of this inquiry is to utilize the All of Us database to discover if there is a correlation between genomic variants and the increased rates of postpartum depression (diagnosed within 12 months of pregnancy) for those impacted by immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) – multiple sclerosis (MS), Crohn’s disease (CD), rheumatoid disorders (RD) [axspA, PsA, RA], and allergic rhinitis (AR) – when age, ancestry, BMI, number of steps, access to health resources, household number, and alcohol intake are taken into account.","Project Purpose(s)

Introduction:
Mental health is a critical area of study, particularly in light of the ongoing global mental health crisis. Traditional measures of mental health often encompass conditions such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis. However, the subjective nature of mental health data collection and the presence of ambiguous or missing data present unique challenges for researchers utilizing electronic health records (EHRs). This proposal seeks to investigate the ""All of Us"" Research Workbench to determine how it handles missing and ambiguous data, particularly in relation to mental health indicators.
Objectives
1. To identify relevant mental health indicators within the ""All of Us"" Research Workbench.
2. To evaluate the transparency of data cleaning practices and the use of data proxies within the platform.
3. To assess the likelihood of data bias in specific datasets related to mental health.","Project Purpose(s)

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of individuals worldwide. The social isolation, financial hardships, healthcare crisis and overall uncertainty about the future has increased the probability of anxiety and depression. These trends are highly visible in Puerto Rico, where the usage of mental hotlines have doubled during the pandemic. However, a preliminary analysis of assessments and surveys by the Montalvo-Ortiz lab have suggested a high degree of resilience to depression in the Puerto Rican population (N=200). In this project I will expand on this proposal by comparing responses from the Montalvo-Ortiz questionnaires with responses from individuals within the United States to identify any differences in healthcare outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled for across differing sociodemographic factors.","Project Purpose(s)

The Montalvo-Ortiz and All of Us questionnaires include sociodemographic information pertaining to the participant’s gender, age, ethnic group, financial situation, educational background and region of origin. Moreso, they include information about health including diagnoses, stress levels, depression, suicidality, mental health treatment history, sleep quality, smoking use, alcohol use, post-traumatic stress, and self-reported resilience. The datasets will be stratified across the differing sociodemographic statuses using R, to compare the different health outcomes after the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis is integral in understanding whether there may be a genetic underpinning that provides certain groups with a higher capacity to endure adversity.","Anticipated Findings

We aim to explore the links between Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and common diseases. One crucial inquiry examines how income and education levels relate to cardiovascular disease prevalence, addressing health disparities and equity. Investigating air quality's impact on respiratory conditions informs policies, benefiting affected communities and urban planning. Understanding loneliness and dementia risk in older adults aids strategies for mental health support and disease prevention. Analyzing healthcare access's influence on chronic diseases helps ensure equitable care and disease management. Research on food deserts and obesity informs interventions to combat the global obesity epidemic. Addressing racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes is essential for equitable access to quality care. Evaluating health literacy programs empowers individuals to make informed health decisions.","Project Purpose(s)

Our study leverages machine learning (ML) to investigate SDOH's associations with diseases while focusing on creating impactful data visualizations. We'll integrate electronic health records and SDOH data, employing ML algorithms like decision trees and neural networks for prediction. Cross-validation ensures model reliability, and ethical data handling is a priority. We will emphasize the use of data visualizations, including geographic mapping, to communicate results effectively. Collaboration with experts and peer validation ensures robustness. Feature engineering and interpretability techniques enhance model understanding. This approach aims to provide actionable insights for public health research and policy development, with a strong emphasis on visually conveying complex findings.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings from our study include the identification of key Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) factors strongly associated with common diseases, revealing geospatial patterns in disease prevalence and SDOH disparities. Our ML-based predictive models are expected to accurately forecast disease trends and disparities, while insights into health equity and the effectiveness of health literacy programs will empower informed decisions.
These findings will significantly contribute to the scientific knowledge in the field by deepening our understanding of how SDOH influence common diseases, enabling targeted interventions, pinpointing regions needing specific attention, revolutionizing healthcare with predictive models, promoting health equity, and guiding evidence-based policies.

Our scientific question is about the health disparity in alcohol use disorder (AUD), substance use disorder (SUD), and mental health, as well as the impact of the COVID pandemic on such health disparity. The COVID pandemic has been bringing financial, social, and psychological burdens, which are known risk factors for SUD and mental problems. Populations from minority groups, being socioeconomically disadvantaged, of younger ages, or with limited access to corresponding health care are at particularly higher risk of developing SUD or mental problems. Adolescents and young adults are also at higher risk. The understanding of how social determinants of health (SDoHs) are associated with the risk of new SUD and mental health problems will help better support the high-risk populations during and after the COVID pandemic.","Project Purpose(s)

Aim 1) Explore risk factors for early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC, age <50 at diagnosis)
The incidence of EOCRC has doubled in the last two decades, and although screening is effective, this is reserved for their older counterparts. Understanding risk factors may lead to future targeted interventions and tailored screening recommendations.
Aim 2) Explore interactions between age and sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health and disease-related outcomes
EOCRC presents unique financial and social challenges compared to LOCRC. Financially, younger patients often face greater economic burdens due to potential loss of income during their prime working years. Socially and psychologically, disruptions in key life milestones such as career development, marriage, and parenthood can lead to issues like depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Conversely, these may affect the patient's ability to acquire treatment and affect outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Studying the relationship between the presence or absence of menstruation-related factors and an individual's self-reported mental health status is important -
1.Women's Health Understanding:
Menstruation-related factors are integral to women's health, and understanding their impact on mental health contributes to a comprehensive understanding of women's well-being.
2.Personalized Healthcare:
Identifying associations between menstruation-related factors and mental health can contribute to personalized healthcare approaches. Tailoring interventions based on individual characteristics fosters more effective and patient-centered care.
3.Reducing Stigma:
Exploring the correlation helps destigmatize discussions around women's health and mental health. It encourages open conversations, reduces stigma, and promotes a more inclusive healthcare environment.","Project Purpose(s)

Existing research often lacks specificity in addressing the unique experiences of young African-American women, neglecting the cultural and societal contexts that shape their mental health. By bridging this gap, the research aims to provide valuable insights that can inform tailored interventions and support systems to enhance the mental well-being of young African-American women. We hypothesize that there is a significant association between specific sociocultural factors and the prevalence and severity of depression among young African-American women. Through a comprehensive examination of factors such as racial identity, gender roles, socioeconomic status, and community dynamics, we anticipate identifying distinct patterns that contribute to the manifestation and persistence of depressive symptoms in this demographic.","Project Purpose(s)

Reducing Racial/Ethnic Biases in ML Prediction of Depressive Disorders,Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. We might be able to reduce the burden of depression if we can improve our ability to identify who currently has it and our ability to predict who might develop it in the future. Technological advances like machine learning (ML) may help us do so, and algorithms have already started to be integrated into medical settings to help with the detection of other diseases and disorders. However, preliminary evidence suggests that machine learning algorithms are biased against people of color, both in healthcare generally, and in mental healthcare specifically. Thus, a central question is not just whether ML detection of depression works, but also WHOM it works for. The proposed study will investigate if improving training set representation and including social determinants of health as predictors reduces racial/ethnic bias in an algorithm predicting depressive disorder diagnosis in the electronic health record.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (major depressive disorder)
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development
Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)","Scientific Approaches
The study will use the NIH All of Us dataset (Controlled Tier) to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts who will receive a depressive disorder diagnosis in their electronic health record. A preliminary algorithm (the ‘development-as-usual’ algorithm) will be built in accordance with common practices in the current literature and will be assessed for racial/ethnic bias. Then, we will test the effectiveness of two bias mitigation strategies: 1) increasing racial/ethnic diversity in the training set, 2) including more diverse predictors as features, and 3) combining strategies 1 and 2.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the ‘development-as-usual’ algorithm will exhibit significant bias against people of color when predicting depressive diagnoses. We expect that each bias mitigation strategy will reduce bias, with the most significant bias reduction conferred by the combination of both strategies.
Many have proposed that improving our ability to predict and detect depression could reduce the worldwide burden of the disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that if we deploy the algorithms currently being developed, there is a significant risk of algorithmic bias that could improve circumstances for some groups while increasing disparities in mental health treatment for others. Therefore, it is extremely important that AI developers attend to and attempt to mitigate algorithmic bias.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This research aims to understand relations between mental health disorders including latent classes, rates of comorbidity, and patterns between familial diagnoses and self-diagnoses. Additionally, we aim to understand how social determinants of health including neighborhood characteristics, adverse experiences, educational opportunity, and discrimination impact rates of psychiatric diagnoses. In particular, we are interested in examining different latent classifications of mental health diagnoses between racial and ethnics identities to elucidate unique needs across identities and how racial and ethnic identity may interact with other demographic (e.g., gender) and social determinant (e.g., adverse childhood experiences, nativity) to predict likelihood of experiencing mental health disorders.
This work will be used to inform public health initiatives, clinical interventions, and intervention and prevention efforts at the individual, familial, and community levels.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Latent class analytic approaches will be used to derive latent classifications of mental health disorders for the full sample and by racial and ethnic identity. In addition, categorical and linear regression approaches will be utilized to examine relations between social determinants of health and latent class membership. We also plan to use structural equation modeling approaches to examine various models of psychopathology, such as common factors models, and pathways from social determinants to factors of psychopathology.
We plan to use data from self-report surveys and medical records to examine variables related to mental health diagnoses (self and family), sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., nativity, gender, education, race), neighborhood characteristics, discrimination, religiosity, adverse childhood experiences, and perceived stress.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that there may be different latent classes of mental health disorders as a function of racial and ethnic identities. We anticipate that common factors models of psychopathology will  fit the data for all groups; however, the strength of indicators as they relate to psychopathology will differ. For example,  we hypothesize religiosity will demonstrate a stronger protective effect for Black and African American individuals compared to White.
Findings will contribute to the scientific knowledge by elucidating similarities and differences in the presentation of psychopathology between racial and ethnic groups. It will contribute to our understanding of risk and protective factors for psychopathology and the strength of indicators between groups. These findings have clinical (e.g., screening measures, risk of comorbidity), social, and public policy (e.g., developing strategies to mitigate impact of ACEs) implications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of depression in older adulthood ranges from 6-9% in primare care samples, and is commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated. Growing mental health workforce shortages and few mental health providers accepting Medicare compound these difficulties. While efforts to manage depression in primary care have advanced greatly, less than half of older adults receive effective treatment, and of those 30% develop treatment-resistant depression.

While a range of medications are available to treat the difficulties in focus and executive function that characterize all types of ADHD, these medications are not primarily targeted to mental health issues comorbid to ADHD. Research has shown that people with ADHD experience an elevated rate of mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, which can cause significant impacts in quality of life.
It is well-known that exercise leads to significant benefits for mental health for all populations.  One interest for this project is to examine whether there is a stronger (or weaker) exercise-mental health link for people with ADHD. This project will compare the correlation between these two variables for ADHD and non-ADHD populations and evaluate if there is a statistically significant difference.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
The Personal and Family Health History survey module includes a question on ADHD diagnosis. 3,200 respondents indicated that they had personally been diagnosed with ADHD.
Variables that will be used from this data source are:
Exposure:
•	Vigorous Physical Activity: During the last 7 days, did you do vigorous physical activities like heavy lifting, digging, aerobics, or fast bicycling?
•	Moderate Physical Activity: Think about all the moderate activities that you did in the last 7 days. During the last 7 days, did you do moderate physical activity like carrying light loads, bicycling at a regular pace, or doubles tennis?
Outcome:
•	Mental health self-assessment: In general, how would you rate your mental health, including your mood and your ability to think? (Poor/Fair/Good/Very Good/Excellent)
Covariates:
•	Age
•	Gender
•	Race/Ethnicity
•	Household Income
•	Relationship Status","Anticipated Findings
My preliminary hypothesis (based solely on my own and others' anecdotal experience) is that exercise will significantly benefit mental health, and the benefit may be higher for people with ADHD than for the general population.
While this project is mainly a class project for learning health data analysis methods, it may also contribute to knowledge and awareness of mental health issues related to ADHD and the actions that anyone may take to support their mental he","Demographic Categories of Interest

We want to know if certain levels of estrogen and testosterone are linked to a greater prevalence/ risk of  a patient developing schizophrenia and what sort of effect each of those hormones have on the genes/ SNPs associated with schizophrenia? These questions are important because if more studies can be done on the effect of hormones in women and men and the onset of schizophrenia and how certain hormones like estrogen and testosterone play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, then perhaps more accurate therapies could be developed that target those hormones that trigger the onset of schizophrenia","Project Purpose(s)

Young adults (ages 18 to 26 years) who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are at significant risk for inadequate access to mental healthcare and mental illness due to societal stigma, marginalization, and exclusion.  Approximately 54% of LGBTQ youth and young adults in the US report unmet need for mental health care, and levels of unmet need are higher for LGBTQ racial/ethnic minorities. This study aims to investigate how healthcare system and social determinant of health factors shape mental healthcare access among LGBTQ young adults. The aims of the study are to:
a.	Characterize racial/ethnic differences in mental healthcare access among LGBTQ sub-groups;
b.	Examine the relative importance of healthcare and social determinant of health factors in explaining unmet need for mental healthcare and mental health outcomes; and
c.	Investigate how interactions with healthcare providers influence unmet need for mental healthcare and mental health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
This cross-sectional study will use survey data from the 'All of Us' study with a sub-sample of adults who self-identify as sexual or gender minorities in the demographics survey.  We will examine social determinants of health (Neighborhood, Social support, Discrimination, Food security, Housing, Stress, Spiritual life, Language) and healthcare factors (insurance, cost barriers to care, distance to care, transportation, interactions with healthcare providers) as potential explanatory factors for understanding drivers of unmet mental health need and mental well-being among LGBTQ young adults. We will assess differences among LGBTQ sub-groups as well as racial/ethnic subgroups, as these groups are heterogenous and may experience different barriers to mental healthcare access and utilization. We plan to use multivariate models in R to examine which social determinants of health and healthcare factors are the highest priority to target to address unmet mental healthcare needs.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study may identify targets for interventions inside and outside of healthcare to improve access to mental healthcare for LGBTQ young adults. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to closing disparities in population mental health outcomes for LGBTQ young adults and developing a more equitable system of mental healthcare. Our findings will expand our knowledge of where and to whom interventions are the highest priority to target, as well as the potential mental health benefits of more comprehensively addressing social determinants of health. We plan to use findings to inform additional mixed methods research to explore how LGBTQ young adults experience barriers to mental healthcare through the lens of sexual/gender identity and their views on how affirmative care in mental health systems should be defined.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We carried out a zebrafish genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a motivated behavior that resulted in over 30 significant Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). We found that genes in these QTLs were, more often than expected by chance, associated with mental health disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Moreover, we found 19 sequence elements that are conserved between zebrafish and humans and contain at least one zebrafish genome-wide significant variant. Here, our goal is to further explore the conserved sequence elements and SNPs within them in the human data to determine whether genotype-phenotype associations can be detected, especially with respect to mental health phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the whole-genome sequencing data and the information on mental health available from electronic health records and survey questions. We will test whether human variants in the conserved sequence elements, identified through studying the zebrafish motivated behavioral spectrum, are associated with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD, using appropriate statistical methods. For instance, for common variants we will use logistic regression, whereas for rare variants, we will use Fisher's Exact Test.","Anticipated Findings
Zebrafish is a tractable genetic model that can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying complex behavior including brain circuitry.

Racial/ethnic minorities often suffer from poor mental health outcomes due to multiple preventable factors including inaccessibility of high-quality mental health care services, cultural stigma surrounding mental health care, and overall lack of awareness about mental health conditions. Therefore, racial/ethnic minorities may underreport mental health diagnoses in self-administered questionnaires due to stigma. In this study, we will compare health survey data and electronic health record (EHR) acquired data to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Latinx and Asian Americans using data from the All of Us program. Note: This workspace is a duplicate of our organization's ""Asian American Health"" workspace and is an extension of the project being worked on in the original workspace.","Project Purpose(s)

The escalating burden of severe obesity in women of reproductive age has driven a growing utilization of weight loss surgery (WLS) in this population. Despite benefits such as reduced incidence of gestational diabetes, a pregnancy after WLS is considered high-risk given the elevated rate of various adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, there have been serious concerns about the negative impact of WLS on maternal mental health, particularly related to depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality. These mental disorders increase the risk for severe maternal morbidity by 50% and are the leading cause of maternal mortality.
We propose to use All of Us data to accomplish two specific aims. Aim 1 Determine the individual and composite prevalence of depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality in pregnant women post-WLS. Aim 2 Examine the association of composite mental disorders with severe maternal morbidity post-WLS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
For Aim 1, we will use t-test to compare the prevalence of mental disorders between pregnant women post-WLS and comparison groups. For Aim 2, we will apply logistic regression to examine the association between mental disorders and severe maternal morbidity, adjusting for factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and pregnancy complications.","Anticipated Findings
This study is of clinical significance because the findings will aid clinicians in offering more informed counseling regarding the risk-benefit profiles of preconception WLS. Also, this study carries policy relevance. Current policies aiming to enhance perinatal mental health care mainly target traditional high-risk groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status. This study will raise awareness about the mental health burden faced by women conceiving post-WLS, supporting future advocacy for the inclusion of their needs into policy formulation. Moreover, while national guidelines for post-WLS pregnancy management have been published, mental health was a missing piece. This study can, therefore, foster efforts to develop more inclusive guidelines that incorporate mental health aspects, to optimize maternal care post-WLS.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Emerging adulthood is a unique developmental period between adolescence and adulthood, characterized by instability across multiple domains of life.  Literature suggests that emerging adults with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for mental health difficulties and reduced quality of life. However, much of the literature has focused on emerging adults within a single academic institution and there is a great need to explore these health outcomes among a more diverse sample of emerging adults. We aim to utilize the All of Us data to ascertain health profiles among emerging adults with chronic medical conditions and identify modifiable factors associated with these health profiles. By employing a biopsychosocial framework, we hope to ascertain salient factors that could be targeted to improve health outcomes for this underserved population. Initial exploration of the available data and sample sizes will drive planned analyses and specific research questions.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
An initial exploration of the datasets are required to determine what data is available for emerging adult participants and which datasets can be best utilized to answer our overall research question. Once the datasets are chosen, specific health indicators and associated factors will be selected. To determine health profiles, latent profile analysis will be utilized which takes a person-centered approach to understanding patterns of symptoms and characteristics. Health profiles will be analyzed based on a number of mental (e.g., depressive and anxious symptoms) and physical health (e.g., fatigue, exercise, cortisol) indicators, which will be selected during the initial exploration of the datasets. After the optimal class solution is identified, the R3STEP procedure, which employs multinomial logistic regression, will be utilized to assess predictors of class membership.","Anticipated Findings
It is anticipated that a variety of health profiles will be identified, which will be characterized by unique sets of symptoms (e.g., depressive and anxious symptoms) and health outcomes (e.g., high cortisol, fatigue, low physical activity). Although a priori hypotheses are not appropriate for latent profile analyses, we do expect that results will yield a solution with more than three profiles (e.g., good health, moderate symptoms, poor health), as the analytic approach is expected to identify a more nuanced picture of health. We expect that several biopsychosocial factors will be associated with specific health profiles, indicating that some factors increase or decrease risk for particular patterns of health indicators. Some factors that will be considered include socioeconomic status, experience of discrimination, social support, healthcare access, ACES, family history, spirituality, and coping skills.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Disparities exist within the treatment of chronic pain and substance use.  Racial/ethnic disparities in the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pain have been extensively documented, with marginalized groups (i.e., racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority groups; low SES) consistently reporting greater pain-related functional impairment and are less likely to receive  to receive adequate treatment for their pain. Similarly, patients belonging to minoritized groups endorse higher rates of substance use and misuse, enter treatment later while also being less likely to complete, and evince higher substance-related morbidity and mortality. These racial/ethnic inequalities in physical and mental health extend from the civilian population to military veterans.  The overarching goals of this study are to examine reciprocal associations among SDoH (e.g., perceived medical discrimination), pain, substance use (e.g., nicotine/tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, opioids), and veteran status.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We have a workspace utilizing the Registered Tier Dataset v6 that investigates the associations among SDoH, pain, and SUD in the overarching All of Us sample. As directed by the All of Us Helpdesk, we will export and download versions of notebooks without outputs from that workspace and upload them into the Controlled Tier Workspace for the current workspace, including: electronic health records and items from several questionnaires (e.g., “The Basics,” “Lifestyle,” “Social Determinants of Health,” and “Healthcare Access & Utilization”). The study sample will focus on adults aged 18 and older who endorse current pain (EHR), report current every or someday use of at least one substance, and have available data pertaining to SDoH and healthcare access and utilization. We will then use the Controlled Tier dataset v7 to use the Veteran Status variable as well as other variables that may mediate relationships among SDoH, pain, and SUD across the two populations (e.g., Genomic, EHR).","Anticipated Findings
Overall, we anticipate positive associations between SDoH and worse health outcomes among individuals with co-occurring pain and substance use. Limited research has examined SDoH in this context, and these results may elucidate drivers of disparities and inequities in pain-substance use trajectories/outcomes. While we expect to confirm that these associations are qualitatively consistent across the Veteran and non-Veteran population, previous studies have noted important differences in these populations in the prevalence and effect of SDoH, pain, and SUD on physical and mental health depending on specifics of each of these variables, indicating that the associations among SDoH and worse health outcomes among individuals with co-occurring pain and substance in the Veteran population may differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the non-Veteran population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The datasets which will be used in this study are All of Us, the UK Biobank, and FinnGen. UK Biobank is a large biobank study in the United Kingdom which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease, including more than 500,000 participants to date. The FinnGen project collected biological samples from 500,000 participants in Finland over six years with the aim of improving health through genetic research, covering 10% of the whole population. I will apply GWAS, polygenic risk scoring, Mendelian randomization, and genetic correlation analyses. Polygenic risk scores provides a measure of your disease risk due genes, Mendelian randomization uses measured variation in genes of known function to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease. Genetic correlation is the correlation of phenotypic effects by genetic variants across the genome on two phenotypes.","Anticipated Findings
As mentioned previously, endometriosis is a common, but understudied disease. It is currently unknown which genetic factors are causal for the disease. Furthermore, there are only three studies that investigated the genomic relationship between endometriosis and mental health so far, and none of them applied polygenic risk scores to do so. We will advance the field by investigating the genetic relationship between mental health (focusing on psychological trauma), which will be highly valuable for the field. We anticipate that women who went through childhood trauma has endometriosis more often, and genetic predisposition to trauma also predisposes for endometriosis diagnosis.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Substance use disorder is a major public health crisis in adolescents in the USA. Research indicates that the legalization of marijuana, as a potential solution to the opioid crisis and a social justice reform for people, has resulted in frequent use of marijuana and an increased risk of cannabis use disorder in adolescents.

Mental illness is a leading cause of disease burden, negatively impacting the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Yet, these conditions often go untreated. Although disparities in mental health services use are well-documented, less is known about disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of specific mental health conditions in diverse populations. This knowledge is critical to inform targeted interventions to improve access to mental health diagnosis and treatment. In this analysis, we will examine patterns in lifetime diagnosis, timing of diagnosis, and current treatment status for a wide variety of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorder, social phobia, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia across key sociodemographic groups (e.g., by gender, gender identity, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status).","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research ( Psychiatric disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will use All of Us surveys (e.g., the Basic Survey), including the personal and family health history data, and electronic health record (EHR) datasets for this analysis. We will describe the frequency and prevalence of lifetime diagnosis and use of mental health treatment for each mental health condition, overall and by sociodemographic characteristics. We will use logistic regression analysis to evaluate differences in diagnosis and treatment by sociodemographic characteristics to identify those factors independently associated with these mental health outcomes. Further, we will use EHR data to confirm and supplement self-reported mental health diagnosis and treatment from the survey dataset using relevant ICD-10 codes.","Anticipated Findings
This study will identify current disparities in mental health diagnosis and treatment in the U.S. This research will help inform more equitable and accessible population-based interventions to improve and promote mental health and well-being.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a debilitating mental disorder affecting 10-20% of women following the birth of a child. It can have long-term consequences on the mother's physical and mental health and overall well-being. Children of mothers with depression are at risk for developmental delays as well as decreased cognitive, social, and emotional skills.
There has been extensive research investigating risk factors associated with postpartum depression; however, there have been few studies exploring the influence that PPD has on long-term maternal outcomes.
This study will focus on future outcomes associated with having had PPD. Our study aims to compare patient-reported mental health status and ability to access mental health resources in a population with a history of PPD.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (postpartum depression)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to do a retrospective matched cohort study using the All of Us Research Program database. Patients with a history of postpartum depression at the time of survey administration will be matched with controls (1:5) based on state of residence, age, and race/ethnicity. We look to investigate differences in how both groups rate their mental health, coping skills, and aspects of resiliency at the time of survey administration. Logistic regression models will be developed to examine the association between the exposure of PPD and patient-reported survey responses regarding mental health outcomes and access to mental health resources.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings include an association with a history of PPD and future mental health disorders such as major depression and decreased scores in self-reported wellbeing outcomes such as resilience. This study will help identify whether experiencing PPD can negatively impact future mental health, coping skills, and resilience. This could provide support for better screening and treatment for PPD and help physicians outside of OBGYN understand future impact of PPD on long-term health.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Transgender populations, comprised of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth, face substantial mental health and substance use inequities compared with cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) people in the United States. These inequities include heightened risk of psychological distress, depression, and suicidality, as well as increased binge drinking and substance use disorders, and are driven by high exposure to stigma and discrimination. Though research has consistently linked stigma-related stress at the individual and interpersonal levels to negative mental health and substance use outcomes, fewer studies have assessed structural stigma, defined as the systematic devaluation and marginalization of transgender people. We aim to investigate the association between state-level structural stigma and mental and behavioral health.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use data from the All of Us Study to, (1a) among transgender people, investigate the associations between state-level structural stigma and a range of mental health and substance use outcomes, and (1b) among the total sample, investigate whether the association between transgender vs. cisgender identity and these outcomes varies by state-level structural stigma.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that state-level structural stigma is associated with poorer mental and behavioral health outcomes among transgender people, and that state-level structural stigma is also associated with narrower differences in mental and behavioral health outcomes between transgender and cisgender people.

we expect to find mental health issues related to sickle cell disease--especially depression. People without diseases go through depression, and so the experience of sickle cell disease might be a risk factor for a depressive episode or episodes. we expect the African American population to experience fewer therapeutic tendencies or interventions as cooping for the disease. This is due to a stigma around mental health and a lack of access to mental health resources in the African American community. there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of sickle cell anemia and mental health. Researching this would add to future research towards encouraging therapy and showcasing the positive effects it can have on coping with the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Researcher have shown that there was an increase in discrimination some points of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many researchers have suggested a myriad of reasons why this may be. However, it remains unclear what the correlates and distribution of discrimination experiences were for different groups of people. In addition, it is unknown how these experiences increased or decreased during high points in the pandemic. Lastly, it is unclear how social isolation and the disruption in human connection (e.g. with family, friends, etc.) may have been associated with the mental health effects of discrimination during the pandemic. This is of considerable public health significance because we must not only address the mental health needs of those in need, but understand the specific correlates of mental health, such as discrimination, to prevent such an uptick in mental health distress due to discrimination during the next pandemic.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
I plan on using the COPE data source from May 2020-February 2021 to examine changes in experiences of discrimination, social isolation, human connection, and mental health. I will utilize hierarchical linear models to asses random and fixed effects, as well as potential mediators and moderators. The COPE has questions related to discrimination experiences in each wave, family connections, social isolation, and mental health. I will also utilize the main survey to access basic sociodemographic information (e.g. race/ethnicity, age, socio economic status, etc.) to utilize as covariates in my analyses.","Anticipated Findings
Based on the extant research literature, I believe that we will find that there is a general uptick in perceived discrimination during COVID. In addition, we hypothesize that as discrimination experiences increase, so does poor mental health. We also hypothesize that social isolation will mediate the longitudinal relationship between perceived discrimination and perceive social isolation and perceived mental health. Lastly, we hypothesize a mediated-moderated model whereby those with perceived positive human connections who experience greater discrimination will report less social isolation and thus less poor mental health compared to those with perceived negative human connections who experience greater discrimination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Some of the specific questions we intend to study are: Are there significant differences between Blacks and Latinos in regard to physical activity and nutrition, Are there any barriers that prevent access to proper nutrition and physical activity, and What are the impacts on adverse health for depression and anxiety? These three questions are important for understanding if race is a factor in health disparities, and how we can promote better nutrition and more physical activity across communities in East Los Angeles. After doing a literature review on several different articles related to nutrition and physical activity, some of the gaps in the findings included factors that affect nutritional intake and physical activity the most, and the impacts that they can have on mental health. As it’s not well understood how physical health can impact mental health, the three questions are relevant for decreasing health disparities and increasing awareness for better physical and mental health.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Appropriate statistical analyses will be used to determine if significant differences or relationships exist between the parameters being measured. The All of Us dataset will be used by creating creating concept sets from physical measurements, fitbit step data, and survey data (Basics, Overall Health, Personal Health and SDoH) to look at the impact the social and built environment and socioeconomic status has on physical activity and health.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate finding a positive relationship between high income Black and Latino households and proper access to nutrition and physical activity. We also anticipate finding behavior and low income to be some of the major causes for barriers that prevent proper nutrition and physical activity for Blacks and Latinos. Finally, we anticipate finding an increased risk of depression and anxiety as a result of poor nutrition and physical activity.  By identifying any barriers that hinder access to proper nutrition and physical activity, our findings would contribute to the body of scientific knowledge by helping in creating behavioral interventions and policies for improved nutrition and physical activity in Black and Latino households, specifically in East Los Angeles.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This will be an epidemiology study that aims to interrogate the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and COVID-19 symptoms.  Depression is the most common mental health condition and affects more than 300 million people around the world. It is also a leading cause of suicidal death.  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected >200 million people and caused >4.5 million death since its outbreak in late 2019.  It is known that people with mental health problems may have worse physical health, lower immunity, and higher susceptibility to infection. We hypothesize that individuals with MDD before the COVID-19 outbreak are more easily affected by COVID-19 than those without MDD; and vice versa, individuals affected with COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to develop or deteriorate depression symptoms than those not affected. A clear relationship between MDD and COVID-19 status will help to establish better screening and prevention strategy for both two health conditions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (major depressive disorder)","Scientific Approaches
Both electronic health records and survey data from All of Us program will be used to examine the relationship between MDD and COVID-19. The definition of MDD will come from electronic health record (ICD9/10) and PHQ-9 questionnaire from COPE survey. COVID-19 symptoms will also come from COPE survey.  We will describe the MDD population statistics before and after COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. COPE surveys from 3 different time points (May, June, July/August 2020) will be leveraged to perform combined analysis and time-varying analysis. Environmental variables (e.g., demographic, socioeconomics status, and disease comorbidities) will be extracted as confounder or covariates in our statistical modeling. Univariable analysis will be carried out by chi-square test, log-rank test, and correlation. Multivariable analysis will be performed by logistic regression, cox regression, and generalized linear mixed models.","Anticipated Findings
Expected outcomes will include: 1) descriptive statistic of MDD and COVID-19 by different stratum in All of Us populations; 2) correlation and association pattern between MDD symptoms and COVID-19 status or monitoring strategies; 3) risk stratification model for COVID-19 onset and development that include MDD symptoms as predictors.
With all above expected outcomes, our findings will  not only provide additional insights on how to better manage MDD by controlling COVID-19 affection, but also have better strategy of preventing COVID-19 affection by screening high risk MDD patients for earlier intervention and vaccination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are adverse differences in cancer burden experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and medically underserved area/populations (MUA/P). An individual diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) faces a variety of physical and mental health-related issues and social and financial challenges. Minorities and MUA/P are more likely to suffer from adverse events (AEs), have a lower quality of life, and experience greater financial hardship. MM survivors of MUA/P face an increased financial toxicity and differences in palliative care. New MM treatments have improved clinical courses and survival. However, these differ in their mode of action, safety profile, and AEs. The goal of this study is to establish the benchmark for an integrated systematic investigation to assess toxicities of different MM drugs due to acquired drug resistance and disease relapse to improve the survivorship experience for minorities and MUA/P by minimizing culturally sensitive intervention.","Project Purpose(s)

We intend to assess outcomes and survival in MM clinical trials for MUA/P and minorities based on genetically defined traits. A pooled analysis of all MM therapeutic datasets will be conducted. We will evaluate the relationship between time-to-event outcomes and different traits using age-adjusted stratified Cox models. Drug-associated genes and phenotype entries will be analyzed to search for clinical synopses and highly conserved signal transduction pathways. Cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and stem cell self-renewal are controlled by these pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may induce these signaling pathways in MM. We plan to study various (un)known proinflammatory signaling pathways including NF-κB, STAT3-10, PI3K/AKT, growth factors, and Wnt-β catenin based on biological stress responses, epigenetic modification, and RNAseq expression that may help in the initiation and progression of MM.","Anticipated Findings
Upon comprehensive analysis of the various pro-inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of MM, several antiapoptotic proteins and antiapoptotic signaling cascades will be identified which may contribute to the antiapoptotic genomics and phenotype of MM cells. Our goal is to uncover mechanisms that may contribute to the enhanced survival of MM cells and their resistance to drug therapy. Understanding these mechanisms is essential to making progress in the treatment of MM. Additionally, we may be able to identify potential inhibitors of proinflammatory signaling pathways derived from natural sources that can be used both for the prevention and treatment of MM in MUA/P and minorities. Having an understanding of the causes and consequences of signaling pathways in MM will facilitate the development of strategies that will target social determinants of health which are factors in the social environment impacting health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. How do quality of life and overall self-reported health and mental health outcomes among individuals with vaginal or vulvar cancers compare to individuals a) without cancer, b) with breast cancer, c) with other gynecological cancers (ovarian, cervical, endometrial cancers).
2. Exploratory: Do these outcomes differ by demographics within the group of individuals with vaginal or vulvar cancers.
Rationale: Vaginal and vulvar cancers are stigmatized cancers. They are also quite rare and therefore difficult to study in local cohorts. Anecdotal evidence from pilot studies suggests that cancer survivorship outcomes such as quality of life are worse among individuals with vaginal or vulvar cancers compared to other cancer populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (vaginal / vulvar cancer)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Main predictor / exposure: vaginal/vulvar vs. breast vs. other gynecologic cancers vs. no cancer
Main outcomes: self-reported QOL measures from Overall Health Survey:
PPI1585711 (general health)
PPI1585717 (QOL)
PPI1585723 (Physical health)
PPI1585729 (mental health)
PPI1585735 (satisfaction with your social activities and relationships)
PPI1585754 (social roles)
Each of the above: dichtomized to excellent/ very good / good vs. fair / poor
PPI1585741 (everday physical activities)
Dichtomized to Completely/Mostly vs. Moderately/ A little / Not at all
PPI1585747 (Pain, evaluate continuous score)
PPI1585748 (Fatigue, evaluate continuous score)
PPI1585760 (emotional problems)
Dichtomized to Never/Rarely vs. Sometimes/Often/Always
Statistical Analysis:
- Describe outcome scores (means/frequencies; t-tests and chi-squared tests as appropriate)
- adjusted linear and logistic regression (covariates: age, gender [if there is variation], race/ethnicity, income, cancer stage [if available])","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that individuals with vaginal and vulvar cancers on average report worse quality of life / overall self-reported health outcomes compared with those who have no cancer, breast cancer, or other gynecologic cancers.
Potentially, some variation in QOL outcomes is explained by demographic characteristics, hence the adjusted analysis accounting for demographic and clinical factors.
This is a highly understudied group of cancer survivors that have been rarely centered in cancer survivorship research. The large All of Us cohort offers a unique opportunity to assess this understudied cancer population with a substantial sample size.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How does social media affect African American adolescent  mental health triggering anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia?","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The dataset that is being used is nominal due to the fact we’re studying African American adolescents. “Excessive social media can negatively affect teens’ mental well-being. Causing them to develop anxiety,depression, and low self esteem trying to keep up with the new beauty”. With all the social media influencers and today’s trends, wanting to look a certain way or having to have a certain style can cause a lot of problems within, because you’re trying to be something you’re not. “Being on social media excessively can take a turn on your mental health”. Lack of confidence comes in effect when you’re trying your hardest to look like the next person, anxiety plays into the problem when you think others are judging your appearance because you’re not fitting up to the trends. There is a relationship between our variables due to fact all of it is related to the cause of anxiety and low self esteem.","Anticipated Findings
After doing some research the expected outcome is major depressive episodes increased from 9 percent-10.3 percent in Black and African American youth ages 12-17. With all of the facts from researching I was able to come to a conclusion that with social media being such a big influence on today’s generation there would always be some type of mental health issues along the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

However, I also want to consider matching on sociodemographic variables to assess the strength of the association after matching, as well as to see if results are different across sociodemographic strata. If such differences exist, they will help us to better understand inequities in mental health that may be caused due to (proxy) factors such as access to healthy food.

1) Are the determinants associated with risk or protection for mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety?
2) How do the associations look like for different demographics including:
Age, sex assigned at birth, race and ethnicity, residence (urban, suburban, rural), sexual orientation, income, and education.
In the midst of a mental health crisis, accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to find risk and protective factors for mental illnesses in diverse populations. We hope this study will help elucidate this much-needed topic.","Project Purpose(s)

Can wearable technology accurately monitor and track depression symptoms in individuals over time?
What is the relationship between physical activity levels measured by wearables and depression symptoms?
Can wearables help predict depressive episodes and facilitate early intervention?
What are the ethical considerations surrounding the use of wearable technology in mental health research and treatment?
The question of wearables and depression is important because depression is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Wearable technology may offer a convenient and cost-effective method for tracking symptoms and improving early detection and treatment of depression. Additionally, studying wearables and depression may contribute to a broader understanding of the relationship between physical activity, mental health, and overall well-being.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (major depressive disorder)","Scientific Approaches
I will be studying the relationship between wearables and depression using a variety of research methods and tools to answer my scientific questions. Specifically, I plan to use longitudinal observational studies to evaluate the relationship between physical activity levels, sleep patterns, and other physiological parameters measured by wearables and depression symptoms. Additionally, I plan to use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets generated by wearable devices, with the goal of identifying patterns and trends that can help predict and prevent depression. Finally, I plan to conduct ethnographic research to explore how individuals use wearables to monitor their mental and physical health and how these devices can be integrated into depression management programs. To analyze the data collected from wearables, I plan to use data analysis tools such as R or Python, and statistical software such as SPSS or STATA for statistical analysis.","Anticipated Findings
Wearables can accurately monitor and track depression symptoms in individuals over time, and they can provide valuable data to inform treatment decisions.
There is a significant relationship between physical activity levels measured by wearables and depression symptoms, and increasing physical activity may help alleviate depression symptoms.
Wearables may help predict depressive episodes and facilitate early intervention by detecting changes in physiological parameters and alerting individuals or healthcare providers.
Ethnographic research may identify barriers to wearables' adoption and use among individuals with depression, such as concerns over data privacy and security or perceived stigmatization.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Anosmia, or the loss of sense of smell, has been recognized as one of the common symptoms of COVID-19. Studying anosmia is important in the context of COVID-19 because it can aid in early detection and diagnosis of the disease, especially in asymptomatic patients. Moreover, anosmia can have significant implications for mental health outcomes as it has been associated with depression, anxiety, and a decrease in quality of life. Additionally, research has shown that loss of sense of smell can impact behavioral outcomes such as appetite and food intake. Understanding the impact of anosmia on behavioral and mental health outcomes is crucial in order to develop effective interventions and support for those affected.

How does the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals with visual impairment compare to individuals without visual impairment?
Visual disorders are debilitating diseases that account for a majority of irreversible blindness in the United States. Visual impairment can be a source of disability amongst affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought several challenges to individuals with visual impairment, including difficulty accessing care and increased concerns about social interaction. As an example, rapid at-home testing is inaccessible to visually impaired individuals without a caretaker as they are unable to interpret the results. If individuals with visual impairment are suffering disproportionately throughout the pandemic, new tools and policies to increase access to care and mental health services may help mitigate this disparity. Better understanding the COVID-19 experience of people with visual impairment will allow us to address this issue.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Visual Impairment)","Scientific Approaches
Our study cohort will be individuals who have previously had an eye examination. Of these individuals, we will identify individuals who have a visual disorder by their ICD-9/ICD-10 codes or SNOMED diagnoses. We will then utilize the COVID-19 Participant Exposure survey to identify different “spheres” of the COVID-19 pandemic experience, including access to COVID-19 testing, social distancing experiences, and wellbeing. Univariate and multivariate regression models (controlling for age, sex, race, and other covariates) will be used to predict the relationship between the relationship between the visual impairment and the COVID-19 experience. Sub-analyses may be performed in certain demographics to see how the risk for a visual disorder may modulate in certain populations.","Anticipated Findings
Previous studies on this subject have been limited by their sample size (<300 individuals) and their limited sample population (>95% White, or not reporting race). The All of Us database is the largest and most racially diverse US database, where more than 50% of participants are from racial and ethnic minorities. Large-scale ophthalmology research often has a majority White study population; the opportunity to study the association between visual impairment and COVID-19 experience in individuals from historically underrepresented backgrounds will help us ascertain how this relationship might shift in certain populations. The large sample size may allow us to discover associations in populations where previous analyses were underpowered.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am currently exploring the data to formalize a specific research question. I am interested in the relationship between mental health symptoms and experiencing discrimination as well as the relationship between mental health diagnoses and experiencing discrimination. Are mental illness symptoms or mental health diagnoses more strongly related to reporting experiencing discrimination? Additionally, are there meaningful differences in people's experiences of discrimination based on the type of mental illness or level of severity of their mental health issue(s)?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
People 18 years and older who have answered survey questions about mental health symptoms, diagnoses, and experiences of discrimination will be included in this study. Participants will be categorized based on the severity of mental illness symptoms (normal, mild, moderate, or severe) and will also be classified based on their diagnosis(es).
Descriptive statistics (cross-tabulations with chi-squared tests; means with t-tests) will be used to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of individuals with mental health issues based on symptoms reported and also done separately based on the reported mental health diagnosis(es). Bivariate regression analyses will be performed to analyze the predictors of an individual endorsing a1) mental illness symptoms, a2) mental health diagnoses, and b) discrimination/stigma to get a sense of the data and covariates.","Anticipated Findings
This study should clarify whether mental illness symptoms and/or mental health disorder diagnoses are predictive of reporting and experiencing discrimination/stigma. If so, it should help identify whether one is more predictive than the other as well as which specific symptoms and/or diagnoses are most strongly related to experiencing discrimination/stigma. This will be particularly useful for anti-stigma campaigns and other programs because we will be able to identify those who are likely the most in need of intervention. The results can also help raise awareness about the different and nuanced experiences of anyone who falls under the umbrella of suffering from mental illness.
Based on some previous research I anticipate folks who fall within the categories of having serious or severe mental illness will report more experiences of discrimination/stigma compared to those who fall into categories of less severe mental illness.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I plan to do a cross-sectional analysis with the dataset.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (heart disease)","Scientific Approaches
The dependent variable was incidence of the condition cardiovascular disease, which would include at least one of the following diagnoses – heart disease, congenital heart disease, coronary arteriosclerosis. The condition was evaluated as a nominal variable. The main independent variable was perceived neighborhood safety which was derived from the survey prompt, “My neighborhood is safe.” There were 4 Likert scale responses: agree, strongly agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. I will consider the covariates of housing ownership and mental health and use logistic regressions to run analyses between these variables and covariates.","Anticipated Findings
I hypothesize that a lower perception of neighborhood safety will be a significant factor of cardiovascular disease among participants. This would be very helpful when considering social determinants of health and could assist with policy design and community interventions. Previous studies have looked at perceived neighborhood safety and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and have found significant results.

Military servicemembers and veterans  generally have increased access to healthcare, including mental healthcare through VA and DoD healthcare systems. However, stigma about mental health has been an issue in military populations. Therefore, it is unclear what patterns of mental health care (pharmacological and psychological) that individuals are receiving and whether this differs by military status.
Some previous work has shown that military status was not associated with these services but used a small sample among college students that was further limited by the number of participants using psychological services.

Diagnoses will be identified through both medical records and self-report and medical treatment will be identified through self-report.

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures. The results will demonstrate whether COVID-19 infection increased economic, job, and health access disparities among Hispanic participants.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will define a cohort on All of Us that includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants who self-report COVID-19 infection, have record of a positive PCR test for COVID-19, or have COVID-19 antigens. We will produce data visualization of key results and build logistic regression models predicting ethnicity build using the selected variables of COVID-19 infection and related social determinants of health.  Appropriate interactions will be included to produce a model with explanatory power and parsimonious fit.","Anticipated Findings
1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My goal is to explore the All of Us database in order to establish a relationship between eating habits and the development of psychological disorders (specifically ADHD) in children. While the comorbidities of ADHD and eating disorders have been well-documented, it is less understood how poor diet during childhood (but not necessarily disordered eating behavior) may be used as a predictor of the development of mental illnesses in adolescents and adulthood; in other words, diet may be a kind of early warning sign for certain conditions. My investigation may also explore the long-term health effects of experiencing mental illness during childhood on diet in adulthood, as this represents the other side of the mental health to diet relationship.","Project Purpose(s)

Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
This study will focus on a broad population of participants with a diagnosed mental illness; while comparison between subpopulations of this cohort may yield interesting discoveries, the primary comparison will take place between participants with an ADHD diagnosis and a control participant population with no diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Preliminary background articles for this research have been accessed using PubMed, and I plan to complete the data analysis using R coding language as supported by All of Us.","Anticipated Findings
Based on previous studies, I do not expect to find evidence that diet contributes to the development of ADHD or other mental illnesses; however, it is my hope that my findings may reveal a correlation between favored diets or eating behavior in childhood and the development of mental illness down the road, so that future studies may investigate the link further. If there are dietary “early warning signs” in the development of future mental health disorders, this information can be used to aid early diagnosis and possibly reveal more about the origins of the disorders (linked genes, environmental factors, etc.). In addition, I hope that investigating the subsequent effect of living with ADHD on diet will reveal lesser known challenges faced by these individual, and help clinicians consider these factors as they may effect the overall physical health of their patients.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This study will focus on using the All of us Research program dataset among Latino and Hispanic people to answer the following questions:
1) What is the prevalence of substance use among Latino and Hispanic people of diverse backgrounds.
2) What are the social determinants of substance use?
3) How does aggregating Latino and Hispanic people into one group versus subgroups limit our understanding of substance use and mental health at the intersect of multiple categories of identity (immigrant status, family or ancestry roots, sexual orientation, gender)?
This information is important to inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that can reduce substance use and ultimately decrease and eliminate health complications and rates of mortality. Furthermore, the information obtained can be used to improve current measures among Latino and Hispanic people.","Project Purpose(s)

The goal of this project is to explore the ways in which perceived social support and perceived social isolation interact with each other and other stressors to impact mental health outcomes (e.g., depression and anxiety). Social isolation is a significant public health concern. Eradicating social isolation has been identified as one of the Grand Challenges for the field of social work and the AARP Foundation has identified social isolation as a key mission area. Social isolation is associated with a range of mental health outcomes. Gaining a better understanding of the antecedents (e.g., social stressors) of social isolation as well as the role social isolation plays in the development of negative mental health outcomes has important implications for the development of interventions. Furthermore, identifying the role of perceived social support can better elucidate these relationships and provide important information than can aide in the development of interventions.","Project Purpose(s)

This study will utilize the COPE survey data and possibly link that data to other All of Us data sets (e.g., lab data to integrate biological dysregulation, basic survey, overall health, etc.) Typical epidemiological methods of data analysis will be utilized. This may include, but will not be limited to, multivariate logistic regression, multilevel modeling (for repeated measures), and causal inference techniques. Identification of additional methods and approaches may be identified upon further exploration of the data.","Anticipated Findings
It is anticipated that feelings of social isolation will (1) be associated with greater levels of mental distress, (2) greater reported stress will be associated with higher levels of social isolation, (3) the impact of stressors on social isolation will be buffered by social support. As noted above, by further explicating the ways in which stressors and social support impacts perceptions of social isolation, interventions can be developed and at-risk populations can be identified for the purposes of reducing perceived social isolation and therefore improving both physical and mental health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mechanisms involved in work-related disparities of bone health are complex given the bidirectional relationship between bone and brain which includes indirect
regulation through the peripheral nervous system and directly by releasing molecules that can cross the blood brain barrier. Accelerated biological aging has been linked to conditions including adult mental health disorders, health-related behaviors, and various chronic and age-related diseases. Telomere
length, a widely accepted biomarker of aging (BoA), has been linked to OP and musculoskeletal functioning. Telomere erosion rate can also vary in response to socioeconomic factors and psychosocial stress. Likewise, perturbations in circulating microRNAs and DNA methylation age, also BoA, are affected by SDOH. Thus, although little is known about whether occupational characteristics or job-related stress impact biological aging, it is possible that the relationship between work and bone health may be a result of accelerated aging.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development
Control Set","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study will leverage the extensive data resources of our existing Cincinnati Lead Study (CLS) prospective cohort which has experienced moderate to high levels of Pb exposure during their early life and is now in their early 40’s and involved in various occupational sectors. Aims: 1) Determine the association between workplace risk factors and combined bone and musculature health (bone fragility and neuromotor functions); 2) Identify biomarkers of aging (telomere length, DNA methylation, and circulating microRNAs) associated with workplace risk factors and how they relate to disparities in bone health; and 3) Identify perceptions of (physical and psychosocial) risks of work and associated work-based health protection and promotion strategies which are feasible among employers. Because the CLS cohort is relatively small (89 at last contact), we hope to explore AllOfUs data as a potential control and/or validation cohort.","Anticipated Findings
The core hypothesis of this project is that people experiencing work-related stressors (physical and psychosocial) exhibit poorer combined bone and musculature health outcomes and accelerated biological aging. Further, the association between work-related risk factors and combined bone and musculature health is exacerbated by preexisting social determinants of health, including early-life Pb exposure.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Patients with ESRD on HD present to the ED face a significant burden of social barriers, chronic pain, mental health co-morbidities and substance use disorders.

For this data we will report descriptive statistics of the collected variables in order to compare the social background of ESRD on HD patients who present to the ED. We will report means and confidence intervals for the Distressed Community Index Score and Social Vulnerability Index in order to compare established measurements of social determinants of health between ESRD on HD patients presenting to the ED and the general population. We will also use established scoring systems including ASSIST and PROMIS29 as described above in order to generate risk scores for participants.","Project Purpose(s)

HD patients miss approximately 10% of all treatments. After a missed HD treatment there is a significant increase in risk of hospitalization, ED visits, and ICU admission. Not only are the monetary cost of ED HD approximately four times as expensive as in-center dialysis, but missed HD sessions contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in particularly vulnerable ESRD patients. Patients with depressive symptoms are more likely to miss HD, present to the ED, and face increased mortality due to their ESRD. In addition to depressive symptoms, smoking, pain, low health literacy, low baseline quality of life, and younger age have been found to influence missed HD. By identifying the specific reasons that patients miss HD, new interventions focused on getting patients to hemodialysis can be piloted and their impact on decreasing poor outcomes can be analyzed.

Current literature calls attention to new and alarming records in drug-related deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 13% of Americans reported starting or increasing substance use as a coping mechanism for COVID-19 related stress. (1) In addition, reports of anxiety and depressive disorders were also increased during the earlier months of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the same months in 2019. To date, the effects of COVID-19 related psychological distress and its associated outcomes remain largely un-investigated in communities of color partly due to stigmas surrounding mental health, medical distrust, and decreased behavioral health resource accessibility within these communities. (2-7) Results from this study are intended to highlight a need for continued expansion of equitable access to behavioral health resources and services among racial- ethnic minority communities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Data on a cohort of racial-ethnic minority patients will be collected from the All of Us COPE survey database and reviewed for baseline and sociodemographic information. Participants eligible for inclusion in this study are those who self-report their race or ethnicity as Hispanic and/or nonwhite. The period of time from which data will be collected will be May 2020 through July 2020. Medication misuse will be defined as affirmative responses to the query “did you use prescription opioids/stimulants/sedatives in any way a doctor did not direct you to use it?”. Psychological distress will be classified using questions assessing mood and anxiety based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression module and the Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) mental health rating scales. Both screening tools are based on the DSM-IV criteria for major depression and generalized anxiety disorder and have well-documented reliability and validity in literature. (8,9)","Anticipated Findings
This study intends to provide an analysis of the COPE survey data to investigate the relationship between substance misuse and COVID-19 induced psychological distress among racial-ethnic minorities. As the immensity of both direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 remains under explored, investigating this topic in our study is paramount to further understanding substance misuse and behavioral health within these vulnerable populations. The overarching goal of this study is to utilize the granularity of ethnicities and races in the All of Us program to supplement recently described increases in rates of substance misuse amongst various racial and ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are hopeful that this study will inform on an area of focus which could promote health equity and overall improved health outcomes for minority communities.

This is a copy of a different workspace in order to access the controlled tier level sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data. It is well documented that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are at higher risk for housing instability and adverse mental health and substance use outcomes than individuals who identify as heterosexual. Many studies that previously examined these outcomes have been limited to large cities (e.g., New York City or Los Angeles) with few providing a nation-wide overview of these issues. The aims of this study are to: (1) examine housing differences by sexual orientation and gender identity and (2) assess the relationship between mental health and substance use outcomes and housing instability among LGBTQ people. Secondary aims include examining these differences by other sociodemographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, and geographic location.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use most recent general All of Us dataset. We will examine the data using descriptive statistics including chi-square/ANOVA/t-tests to assess the general associations. Then we will implement a series of logistic regressions based on what proves to be significant at the bivariate level.","Anticipated Findings
1) We hypothesize that individuals who identify as LGBTQ would be at higher risk for housing instability compared to those who identify as heterosexual. (2) Among those who identify as LGBTQ, we anticipate that those who are experiencing housing instability will also endorse adverse mental health and substance use outcomes. (3) We expect that there will be sociodemographic differences by race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, and geography based on all outcomes assessed. The findings from this analysis will add to the LGBTQ health disparities literature as it will provide a national overview of these important stressors and issues. The findings can be used to inform housing, mental health, and substance use policies, programs, and initiatives at the national level, and can also be narrowed down geographically depending on the differences in results.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We propose to explore if a resilience approach can be used to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health among PLWH. We will leverage multiple datasets from the All of Us program, including electronic health records (EHR), a series of COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) surveys, and other self-reported survey data. Integrating these data from about 12 thousand PLWH who participated in COPE, we will: 1) examine the trends and patterns of mental health outcomes among PLWH before and after the COVID-19 outbreak; and 2) identify protective factors at multiple socioecological levels including the individual level, interpersonal level , and health institutional level that may mitigate the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among PLWH, especially the subgroups with socially disadvantaged status (low income and low education) and stigmatized identities .","Project Purpose(s)

As a first step towards developing a mental healthcare system that is personalized, culturally responsive, and community-embedded, the aim of this project is to anticipate the development of adverse mental health conditions through early warning signals, paving the way for personalized just-in-time interventions. Specifically, this project will examine if critical slowing down, one early warning signal, occurs prior to the emergence of an adverse mental health conditions.
1. Evaluate whether digital health information (sleep, exercise, heart rate, activity level) anticipate/predict adverse mental health conditions (billing codes, prescription medication, mental health surveys).
2. Evaluate whether health surveys, participant demographics, contextual variables, physical measurements, anticipate the development of adverse mental health conditions (billing codes, medications) in the future?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Adverse mental health conditions)
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will include participants if they were diagnosed with an adverse mental health condition (depression, anxiety, PTSD, sleep difficulties, or chronic pain) and if they have provided their digital health information (e.g., fitbit). With these participants, first, we will compute latent change score models for each outcome of interest from the baseline measure through the last assessment. Using the latent change score, we will be able to examine estimate the influence of predictors (baseline risk factors) over time on the development of adverse mental health conditions.
To examine the utility of early warning signals in anticipating the emergence of mental illness, using digital health information, we will identify moments of critical slowing down. In a longitudinal intensive time series, critical slowing down can be identified through autocorrelation, variance, kurtosis, and skewness. Testing different rolling window in the time series to identify the optimal point for anticipation.","Anticipated Findings
Although there are several effective interventions to alleviate the burden of adverse mental health conditions, many people do not have reliable access to them or face significant barriers to treatment, including lack of health insurance, availability of culturally relevant treatments, historical mistrust of healthcare services, and discrimination, lack of effectively trained providers, flaws in diagnostic systems, and implementation treatment gaps.
Developing, disseminating, and connecting patients to the right level of treatment would bridge some of these gaps in care.
Evaluating whether early warning signals occur prior to the emergence of adverse mental health conditions would have tremendous impact on prevention and intervention efforts. If early warning signals occur before the emergence of an adverse mental health condition then this would provide the framework for delivering just-in-time interventions, potentially transforming the delivery of mental healthcare.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We seek to study the effects of the 2016 Presidential election on mental health of adults in the United States, mediated by political leaning of their county and other demographic factors, including race and income. This question is important to study because it can help to better understand the effects of party switch at the Presidential level when the elevated candidate (Donald Trump) is strongly disapproved of by members of the opposite party, and support more proactive preparation of mental health resources around the time of elections.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
From the All of Us dataset we plan to use medical data, including anxiety and depression diagnoses and medications, and demographic data, including race/ethnicity and income data. Outside of All of Us, we plan to bring in granular election result data, focusing on the vote counts and margins for Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton on the county level. We'll specifically be using the ""County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020"" available from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
We plan to use a variety of basic statistical tests, such as linear regression, to evaluate the effect of our independent variables, county political lean and demographic indicators, on our dependent variable, increase in mental health issues.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that increased Democratic vote share in a county correlates with higher levels of mental health issues in the time shortly following the 2016 Presidential election. We also anticipate that non-white racial groups also face higher levels of mental health issues in the same context, compared to white patients.
There are several existing works on the subject. ""Symbolic disempowerment and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election: Mental health responses among Latinx and white populations"" (Morey, Brittany N. et al., 2021) and ""Changes in Mental Health Following the 2016 Presidential Election"" (Yan, Brandon W. et al. 2020) focus on the same question, except using state level data.

Is there a correlation between overall health and delays in receiving medical care in those who identify as women?
Historically, those who cannot easily access medical care have been underrepresented in research. Women in particular have faced challenges in accessing healthcare, which is critical as risk factors for chronic illnesses are becoming more prevalent in women of reproductive age (Daniel et al., 2018). In addition to unique reproductive and mental health issues (Daniel et al., 2018; Witt et al., 2009), there are approximately 38% of women who have one or more chronic diseases, compared to 30% of men (NCSL, 2015). We hypothesize that delays in receiving medical care are related to self-reports of “Fair” or “Poor” health, while those who had no delays reported their health as “Excellent,” “Very good,” or “Good.”","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use responses from the Health Care Access & Utilization survey, specifically “yes” and “no” responses to questions about delays in receiving medical care during a 12-month period. We will include responses from the Overall Health survey, specifically self-reported health status. Using a chi-squared test in R, we will compare the overall health of women who delayed receiving medical care to the women who had no delay in receiving medical care. Poor health will be defined by “Fair” and “Poor” responses, while good health will be defined by “Excellent,” “Very good,” and “Good” responses. From the Data Browser , we found that 101,220 individuals assigned female at birth answered the questions from the Health Care Access & Utilization survey. Of the responses, a total of 84,260 indicated delays receiving medical care during a 12-month period. In this study, we will explore the relationship between overall health of those assigned female at birth and delays in receiving medical care.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that delays in receiving medical care are related to self-reports of “Fair” or “Poor” health, while those who had no delays reported their health as “Excellent,” “Very good,” or “Good.” Delays in receiving medical care impact overall accessibility to health care services. The most common delay reported by women is out of pocket costs for some/all of the procedure, followed by nervousness about seeing a provider and an inability to take time off of work. These reasons could persist, limiting accessibility and utilization of healthcare for women and thus worsen chronic illnesses and/or postpone preventive care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asian Americans are the fastest growing group in the United States that is projected to double in size by 2060. However, the severity of mental health problems (e.g., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) experienced by Asian American cancer survivors are understudied, and even less is known at the Asian subgroup level (e.g., Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans). The severity of mental health problems among Asian American cancer survivors will be examined with the following cancer types: stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, liver, lung and bronchus, breast cancer, ovary, cervical, prostate, gallbladder, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and leukemia. These cancer sites were selected based on their overall contribution to Asian American mortality burden from 2003 to 2011, as well as data on Asian American cancer burden in 2016.

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
[Place Holder] The study plans to use data harmonization methods, by pooling data from various large-scale national public health datasets, combined with multilevel structural stigma indicators, including discriminatory laws, unequal policies, and negative population attitudes across states and counties, over two decades of time, to test three-level (clustered) models with multilevel predictors, both cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally.","Anticipated Findings
[Place Holder] Data harmonization will allow to answer important unaddressed questions, for example , how structural stigma across various levels (e.g., state, county, school district) can exert different effects on sexual minority mental health and coproduce adverse mental health, how county/school district policies may be particularly important during youth and adolescence while macro factors may have a larger role during adulthood, and how the level of urbanization (i.e., urban vs. rural) plays into this.

Most of empirical studies explored risk factors of mental health outcomes in the context of COVID-19, but few studies also identified potential protective factors that can mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes. The identifications of these protective factors can be critical in developing tailored health promotion interventions to reduce mental health disparities among those underserved populations.
The main research aims is to identify potential protective factors for mental health outcomes at multiple socioecological levels including individual level (resilience, physical activity), interpersonal level (e.g., social support), health institutional level (e.g., health service accessibility), and structural level (social determinants of health) adjusting pre-existing health condition including psychiatric disorders and other relevant factors . We will also conduct analysis for different underserved subgroups as the factors could vary by groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Guided by the resilience and socioecological theories, we will leverage multiple datasets from All of Us including a series of COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) surveys conducted from May 2020 to Feb 2021 among a total of 100,340 participants, other self-reported survey data (e.g., Basics, Overall Health, Healthcare Access), and relevant EHR data. We will calculate incident rate of psychiatric disorders in 2019 and 2020. We will conduct preliminary analyses and examine descriptive statistics for outcome measures. Unadjusted and adjusted associations of with key variables and covariates will be assessed using appropriate procedures (e.g., tests of proportions, chi-square tests, Analysis of Variance).  Multilevel hierarchical regression will be used to identify protective factors of psychiatric disorders.","Anticipated Findings

Individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) are at higher risk for mental health and substance use than individuals who identify as heterosexual. Few studies have extended these findings by testing potential downstream effects of LGBT disparities on mental health and substance use to positive outcomes such as subjective well-being. Moreover, resilience and social support are critical protective factors, but their moderating roles are not well understood. The aims of this study are to: (1) examine LGBT disparities in mental health, substance use, and subjective well-being; (2) test COVID-related stress and LGBT-specific discrimination as potential mediators; and (3) understand the extent to which resilience and social support act as buffers against stress, discrimination, mental health, and substance use on subjective well-being. Secondary aims include the exploration of sex differences and sexual minority subgroup differences in the mediators and outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We plan to analyze data from the All of Us COPE Survey to examine whether individuals who identify as LGBT experience disparities in mental health, substance use, and subjective well-being, and test the hypothesized pathways within a structural equation modeling framework.","Anticipated Findings
(1)	We hypothesize that individuals who identify as LGBT would be at higher risk for mental health and substance use behaviors, as well as lower subjective well-being than individuals who identify as heterosexual.
(2)	We anticipate that COVID-related stress and LGBT-specific discrimination would mediate the associations between LGBT status with mental health, substance use, and subjective well-being.
(3)	We expect that resilience and social support would moderate the hypothesized pathways.
The findings from this study will add to the literature on LGBT health disparities as it uniquely focuses on stressors and discrimination experiences during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings will have the potential to inform prevention efforts on the population level during a public health crisis.

Our study looked prevalence rates for the above conditions in the following ways:
1. Prevalence in EHR data available by various demographic factors
2. Cohort characteristics
3. Congruency for diagnoses in EHR and self-report questionnaire

We are interested in the conditions that accompany obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are conditions that are risk factors for OSA, so we expect to see those prior to a diagnosis of the sleep problem. There are also many comorbidities of OSA, such as cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and diabetes. We believe that there may be mechanisms underlying OSA and these comorbidities that are present before diagnosis. We therefore want to look at when co-occurring conditions occur before and after a diagnosis of OSA. We also wish to assess those conditions in people without OSA as a comparison.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (obstructive sleep apnea)","Scientific Approaches
We will look at conditions relative to the date of diagnosis of OSA. We will assess the timeline of occurrence of events (diagnosis, survey, vital) relative to OSA, and assess the conditions that occur early, simultaneously or late. We will look at the conditions commonly associated with OSA (CV disease, mental health, etc) in people without indication of a sleep disorder, and see whether the timeline and severity differs with the OSA group.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to see conditions occurring prior to a diagnosis of OSA. This would suggest 1) that we may be detecting OSA late, and that these conditions may be potentially able to help improve screening for OSA, and 2) we may identify possible underlying pathophysiology that could be present in OSA that is also contributing to other health problems.","Demographic Categories of Interest

For my thesis, I am looking at the association between obstetric trauma (3rd/4th degree perineal tears) and mental health outcomes postpartum. While previous research has assessed the relationship between other types of trauma and health outcomes, there is a lack of research assessing the relationship between traumatic or adverse experiences during childbirth and mental health outcomes. This is an important area of research for two main reasons. First, identifying risk factors for imminent poor mental health outcomes is critical for interventions. Second, identifying poor outcomes associated with obstetric trauma can help advocate for more interventions to prevent obstetric trauma, particularly spontaneous tears.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will be using the All of Us dataset. This is a retrospective cohort study with women who have given birth in the All of Us dataset as the baseline population. Those women who have experienced obstetric trauma will be the exposed. Poisson regression will be used to assess the relationship between obstetric trauma and poor mental health indicators, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.","Anticipated Findings
I hypothesize that women who have experienced obstetric trauma are at a greater risk of poor mental health outcomes postpartum. This will be one of the first studies assessing this relationship with a national sample in the United States, and will therefore make a unique contribution to the field.

The impact of COVID-19 is particularly severe on older adults. The older adults (>= 65yr old) account for more than 80% of the mortality. Other reported negative outcomes include anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and physical inactivity. We propose to utilize this unique, rich set of data to study the relationship between social determinants of health (SDOH) and COVID impact on older adults’ behavior and mental health. Our overall hypothesis is that a comprehensive set of SDOH is associated the COVID impact.  Our specific aims are:  Aim 1. Identify SDOH factors that are significantly associated with COVID impact on older adults’ behavior, adjusting for age and comorbidities; Aim 2. Identify SDOH factors that are significantly associated with COVID impact on older adults’ mental health, adjusting for age and comorbidities.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will use a logistic regression model as the primary approach, to describe and examine whether patients with certain SDOH will have a lower rate of COVID-related behavior (including hand washing and social distancing) and higher prevalence rates of mental health concerns.  Multivariable models will adjust for potential confounding factors.  In addition, given the multiple factors to be examined (i.e., SDOH, age, and comorbidities), the final models will consider controlling multiplicity to avoid inflated Type I error using Hochberg or false discovery rate method. Besides, we will complement the statistical analysis with explainable deep learning modeling. We will train deep transformer model  (type of DNN designed for sequence data) to identify the level of association between SDOH and COVID experience. The DNN approach will allow us to assess the impact and significance of each variable in the model using a DNN as well as the interactions between factors.","Anticipated Findings

The findings will help identify risk factors  and provide the study basis for the potential preventive strategies for the negative behavior or mental health  among the old population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1)	Describe ethnic and age differences (with a focus on those >65 years old) in responses to questions on:
1. Behaviors re: social distancing
2. Mental health
3. COVID symptoms, testing, treatment
4. Household composition/social isolation
5. Physical activity
6. Smoking, alcohol and other substance use
7. Resilience
8. Discrimination
2)	Examine associations between answers in each category by ethnicity and age, with a particular focus on mental health as an outcome.
3)	Examine any longitudinal changes for questions that are repeated across COPE surveys.
Understanding potential differential effects of the pandemic and on mental health among UBR and elderly populations will inform efforts to tailor interventions to reduce health disparities and foster resilience in these populations.","Project Purpose(s)

This study will compare survey responses to questions regarding social support, access to care, perceived discrimination, anxiety and stress, and drug abuse behaviors at 2 different points in time (6 months apart). In addition, we will compare responses from different racial/ethnic groups, gender identities, and income status to analyze demographic variables as significantly related to these variables. We will use the COPE survey to examine these items and will use SPSS to conduct Chi-Square analyses to examine relation between substance abuse and anxiety and stress, as well as Regression analyses to determine predictive power of social support, access to care, and discrimination on anxiety and stress.","Anticipated Findings

There is a rapidly growing body of literature--both national and international--reporting increased incidence of mental health conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the risk and protective factors reported by recent COVID studies are known predictors of major psychiatric conditions. Further, most prior studies focus on the association of one risk factor with mental health risk at a time using linear models and do not examine multiple risk factors concurrently. More flexible machine learning (ML) approaches that can automatically detect main and interaction effects may provide novel insights for psychopathology by capturing the hidden nonlinear dependence between risk/protective characteristics.","Project Purpose(s)

This is currently very relevant, as we are now passing two years of been in the pandemic. When we went on lockdown two years ago, it was expected that COVID-19 would be an ongoing public health crisis. Not only has our health care system faced challenges in delivering patient care, but the public has also felt the impact in various ways. This sudden and seemingly endless shift in our lives has impacted the mental health and well-being of many individuals to some extent. This project will seek to better understand this impact and assess any significant differences by age and gender.","Project Purpose(s)

According to the CDC, 90% of the nation's $3.5 trillion annual health care expenditures is spent on treating chronic and mental health conditions. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) provided by Registered Dietitians has been shown to be an effective and cost-effective component of treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, in small clinical studies and medical practices in hospitals. Thus, MNT could be an additional powerful medical treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. However, there is no known large-scale research that examines the effectiveness of MNT in the diseases. By leveraging the national-level data from All of Us, we hope to determine if MNT could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. If possible, we would also like to determine if specific nutrition interventions provided in MNT produce significantly better health outcomes compared to other nutrition interventions provided in MNT.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Diseases)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a prospective cohort study for individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndromes. Individuals with those diseases who have completed at least 1 MNT or no MNT will be included in the cohort. MNT is being provided by Registered Dietitians in hospitals and clinics, so data about MNT is available from the EHR. By following those individuals in the cohort over time, we will have their short-, middle-, and long-term health outcomes of the diseases. By comparing the health outcomes between individuals who completed MNT and individuals who did not, after adjusting potential confounders, we will determine if could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. Additionally, we will attempt to categorize different MNTs based on their specific nutrition interventions and determine if specific MNTs are more effective.","Anticipated Findings
The primary outcome of the study is the overall effectiveness of MNT on cardiometabolic diseases. The secondary outcome of the study is the effectiveness of specific MNTs on cardiometabolic diseases. Our finding might provide evidence that MNT is an effective treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, in addition to medications and medical surgeries. MNT provided by Registered Dietitians could be an essential part of a health care team that is responsible for treating cardiometabolic diseases, positively impacting patients' weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose control.  Additionally, since MNT is cost-effective, it could help save health care expenditures, which is beneficial to alleviate the financial burden of the diseases. Lastly, because MNT is an individualized nutrition treatment, our findings could contribute to the understanding of the effect of precision nutrition on human health, as one-size-fits-all nutritional approaches have not been very effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Disparities in mental health care have been well-documented, and I am interested in looking at how this manifests in the practice of prescribing evidence-based medication for PTSD. I will formalize specific research aims once I have seen what data is available on All of Us that can help answer this broad question.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Bipolar disorder)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The goal of this project, ultimately, aligns with the All of Us Research Project scientific framework by seeking to reduce health disparities and improve health equity in underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) populations. A first step in reducing health disparities is demonstrating that these disparities exist, which I seek to do in the treatment of BD. I will use a subset of the All of Us data focused on BD and survey responses about access to mental health care and treatment for this investigation.","Anticipated Findings
I expect that some socioeconomic and demographic variables will be predictive of whether a patient is being treated for bipolar disorder. This will justify further research into what may underlie health disparities in BD treatment, and will justify funding for reducing health disparities and promoting health equity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The terms transgender and gender diverse are umbrella terms for individuals who gender identity is different from their sex assigned at birth. Little is known about the general health of these individuals. As such, we seek to characterize the health and wellbeing of this community and estimate any health disparities between transgender and cisgender individuals. The health conditions and behaviors we will examine include: smoking, body size, alcohol use, substance use, mental health, stress, disability, HIV, hepatitis B and C, HPV, gallstones, hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and receipt of preventative services (vaccinations and cancer screenings).","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will create a cohort transgender and gender diverse individuals using All of Us (AoU) demographics data. We will then select a matched cisgender population from AoU as a comparison group. Participants will be matched on age and race/ethnicity to examine the prevalence of each health condition noted above between the two groups and also calculate prevalence ratios to highlight any health disparities.","Anticipated Findings

Our focus is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation efforts on breast cancer survivors and potential differences with matched controls without a history of cancer based on responses to the COPE surveys to determine whether survivor status has an influence on the experience of the pandemic in either positive or negative ways and to determine what factors (including socioeconomic or race/ethnicity) modify the experience.  Specifically, we will: 1) Describe differences between breast cancer survivors and age- and ethnicity-matched controls without a history of cancer in responses to questions on: 1. Behaviors re: social distancing 2. Mental health 3. COVID symptoms, testing, treatment 4. Social isolation and 5. Health behaviors.  Understanding specific effects of the pandemic on the mental health of breast cancer survivors will inform efforts to tailor interventions to reduce the negative effects of future similarly isolating events among this population.","Project Purpose(s)

• Electronic health records
We will use the statistical analysis tools in R to generate descriptive and appropriate inferential statistics.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to that we will find differences in the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation efforts that will help understand factors associated with either increased resilience or increased negative effects among breast cancer survivors .

The aims of this study are (a) to explore the associations between income loss, food insecurity and parents’ mental health (b) to explore the associations between social and structural neighborhood factors and parents’ mental health across racial/ethnic groups, and (c) to explore whether the associations between food insecurity, income loss and parents’ mental health trajectories were mediated or moderated by SES and neighborhood risk across racial/ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
A series of Bayesian latent growth modeling will be used to assess between person differences and within-person changes on parents' anxiety, stress, and depression levels over time. Using a step-wise approach, a series of models will be tested iteratively by increasing model complexity: random intercept, random slope, non-linear slope, and growth mixture models to determine the best fitting trajectory.  Next, the impact of age, SES, and history of mental illness will be tested using conditional growth curve modeling, and growth trajectories will be compared across racial/ethnic groups by using multigroup latent growth curve models.","Anticipated Findings
Experiencing income loss or food insecurity during the COVID-19 could negatively affect the quality of parent-child interactions due to parents' increased distress. However, identifying the role of SES and neighborhood risk on the association between family financial difficulties and parents’ mental health trajectories can assist  policymakers to help identify the low-resource communities where programs and services can then focus efforts to provide services to in-need families.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This research is guided by the minority stress model, which suggests that minority groups experience stressors identity-specific stressors (over and above day-to-day stressors) that contribute to worse health outcomes over time. Our research conceptualizes the healthcare setting as particularly stressful for LGBTQ patients, and as such may be implicated as an identity-specific stressor. Our research will explore which aspects of healthcare access and utilization are associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes in LGBT populations. We hypothesize that participants who experience more difficulty in accessing care and more negative experiences will have worse physical and mental health outcomes compared to LGBT people with fewer access difficulties and fewer negative healthcare experiences. This research has significant practical implications for the healthcare domain as it could establish clear links between healthcare barriers and health disparities among LGBTQ populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The dataset we hope to obtain will contain several sets of variables from the All of Us project: all variables from the demographic section, healthcare access and utilization section, lifestyle section, and overall health section. We are also interested in the item regarding mental health and substance use diagnoses within the personal medical history section. These diagnoses of mental health and substance use disorders will serve as the outcome variables in our theoretical model. Items within the healthcare access & utilization section such as “How often were you treated with respect by your doctors or healthcare providers?” and “Have you delayed getting care for any of the following reasons in the past 12 months?” will help us to understand and quantify the amount and quality of care received by LGBTQ patients. We plan to use SPSS software to analyze the dataset and assess the associations between relevant variables.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this dataset will corroborate the well-established body of work that demonstrates the significant disparities in physical and mental health in LGBTQ populations compared to cisgender and heterosexual populations. We also anticipate that LGBTQ people who experience more difficulty in accessing care and more negative experiences will have worse physical and mental health outcomes compared to LGBT people with fewer access difficulties and fewer negative healthcare experiences. Overall, we hope that our findings will add to the minority stress theory literature, as the conceptualization of healthcare access and utilization as an identity-specific stressor for LGBT people is a novel application of the model. These findings could spur new explorations in this field of study, as health outcomes for LGBTQ people have not yet been linked to actual healthcare experiences within the minority stress theoretical model.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Approximately 10-20% of women suffer from mental health concerns during the perinatal period While the experience of pregnancy and of becoming a mother is often considered a positive experience, the perinatal period may be a complicated emotional experience, accompanied with psychosocial stress and symptoms of depression, anxiety and trauma related disorders.
