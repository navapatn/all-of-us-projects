We will conduct analyses for type 2 diabetes . We will use Rand BigQuery to retrieve type 2 diabetes participants. We will analyze and describe the distribution of these cohort across age, gender, race, education and blood pressure. We will make comparisons for the demographic variables above. The statistical methods will be used including: ANOVA, Chi-square test, Regression model by R software.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipated to find significant variation of type 2 diabetes participants among the listed risk factors above. Moreover, the significant difference among the clinical risk factors would used on classification of type 2 diabetes  patients to personalized further treatment.

Diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, fatty liver disease and cancer are the epidemic illnesses of modern life. These diseases often occur together, and one common cause is resistance to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance; IR). When measured in the clinic, IR can strongly predict who will develop these diseases later in life. The causes of IR are both hereditary (genetic) and environmental. There is only one class of drugs, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), that treats IR, but TZDs have serious side effects that prevent their widespread use. If we knew which genes were responsible for changing IR, new and much needed therapies could be developed. Here, we propose to use genetic information from participants in All of Us to find people who are genetically protected from IR and look for the specific genetic variants that confer this protection. The result of this project will be new potential targets for therapeutic development to prevent and treat these epidemic scale chronic diseases.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Insulin Resistance)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We propose to use previously published GWAS for traits related to insulin sensitivity/resistance to construct an insulin resistance genetic risk score composed of a series of SNPs. The score for every participant from All of Us will be computed. The participant score will be regressed against the clinical data of the participants including diabetes, cardiovascular events and incident cancers as well as physiologic measures of body composition and relevant serum chemistries and lipid levels. A quantitative clinical profile will be constructed based on this score that is a composite of diagnoses, physiologic and serum measurements. The whole genome sequencing of subgroups of individuals with extreme clinical profile values will be examined for loss-of-function mutations in protein coding genes.","Anticipated Findings
If successful, this research will identify novel mutations and novel genes that protect individuals from diabetes, cardiometabolic diseases, fatty liver disease, and some cancers. Such genes could lead to new classes of medications for these therapies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are exploring an algorithm to define type II diabetes phenotypes from the electronic health records to compare All of Us participants with type II diabetes randomized controlled trial (RCT) participants. We are interested in distribution of demographics, co-morbidities and treatment patterns of type II diabetes. We will not upload RCT data into the workbench. We will only compare summary statistics of these characteristics instead of comparing individual level data. When comparing model performance in All of Us population and RCT population, we will only transfer fitted model parameters to the workbench instead of individual level data.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will compare sample characteristics of participants in All of Us with participants in clinical trials with appropriate statistical tests and correct for multiple comparisons. We will study the generalizability of clinical trial results to the real world observational data such as All of Us. We will assess how to model the outcome and how to choose a scale so that the results from trials are transferrable to the general population.","Anticipated Findings
We do not expect clinical trial participants to be a representative sample of the real world population affected by type II diabetes. By studying a model that is transferrable between populations, our analysis can assist with using the clinical trials results to inform real world decision making.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1- What are the main prescribed medication sequences that participants  with  type 2 diabetes and depression took over three years of treatment?
In this questions, we are extracting the anti-diabetes and anti-depressant medications used to to treated participants who have T2D and depression codes. We retrieved medications prescribed after the first diagnosis code for each disease. We represented the medications using their ATC 4th level.
2- What is the most common first anti-diabetic and anti-depressant that were prescribed for All of Us participants? We extracted the first medications prescribed to treat T2D and depression. We identified the most common first medication with the highest number of participants.
3- Is there a change in the percentages of participants who were prescribed first common medication, treated using one medication, treated only using one common medication between 2000-2018?","Project Purpose(s)

Other Purpose (This work is a result of an All of Us Research Program Demonstration Project. The projects are efforts by the Program designed to meet the program's goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. This work was reviewed and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and the Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use.)","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we plan on using the medication sequencing developed at Columbia University and the OHDSI network as a means to characterize treatment pathways at scale. Further, we want to demonstrate implementation of these medication sequencing algorithms in the All of Us research dataset to show how the various sources of data contained within the program can be used to characterize treatment pathways at scale. We will perform separate medication sequence analyses for three different common, complex diseases: type 2 diabetes, depression
1- Data manipulation
Using python and BigQuery to:
A- Retrieve medication and their classes
B-Create the medications sequences
2- Visualization:
A- Creating sunburst to visualize the sequences
B- Plotting the percentages of participants the first common medication and one medication during three years","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity of the data by showing expected treatment patterns despite gathering data from over 30 individual EHR sites. Specifically, we expect to find:
1- Variation in the medication sequences prescribed to treat All of Us participants who had type 2 diabetes and depression.
2- The most common medication used to treat participants as first line treatment with type 2 diabetes and depression diagnosis.
3- A trend or change over time of prescribing the first common medication over the study period
4- Trend overtime for the percentage of participants
Importantly, the detailed code developed herein is made available within the Researcher Workbench to researchers, so that they may more easily extract medication data and class information using a common medication ontology, an approach useful in many discovery studies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

People who have diabetes are more likely to develop several eye diseases or conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and open-angle glaucoma. For people who have diabetes, it is important to get regular comprehensive dilated eye exam to identify these conditions and have early treatment. This study is to survey cohorts of AoU participants who have diabetes and who do not, and compare the incidence rates of these eye conditions, and to examine their EHR data for regular eye exams as a means of prevention.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
1)	Building datasets: identify participants who have type 2 diabetes and randomly select equal number of participants without type 2 diabetes
2)	Search the EHR records of the participants to identify eye diseases and conditions
3)	Run statistical analysis to find the difference on incidence rate between the two populations","Anticipated Findings
Type 2 diabetic participants will have a higher incidence rate of eye diseases or conditions compared to non-diabetic participants. Using the EHR data, if the type 2 participants do not have more frequent eye exams compared to non-diabetic participants, the findings in the study will provide evidence to recommend for regular eye exams for diabetic patients.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The long term goal of our work is to improve the diagnosis and clinical management of diabetes subtypes by translating recent advances in our understanding of genetic risk factors for diabetes.  We study the role of rare and common genetic variants in diabetes type 1, type 2, and subtypes of monogenic diabetes. We use genetic data in combination with clinical and other variables to develop risk models to better identify individuals with diabetes subtypes.  We test the utility of previously developed genetic risk scores for type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the MyCode cohort and determine the impact of rare disease-associated genetic variants.  The Allofus cohort will allow us to validate and refine our findings from admixed ancestry in a  large diverse population.   We will develop tools to better diagnose diabetes subtypes in individuals of all ancestries including European and non-Europeans  (African American, admixed American. Asian/Pacific Islander).","Project Purpose(s)

We will use genetic data (ngs, chip arrays) for all individuals, all ages, all ancestries; clinical data from ehr include demographics, data pertaining to diabetes: labs, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, tumor (pancreatic), medications.  We plan to validate and refine genetic risk scores for diabetes subtypes and examine rare and common variant contribution to type 1 and type 2 diabetes in association studies.  We also plan to develop risk models for diabetes subtypes, including monogenic diabetes using machine learning approaches.","Anticipated Findings
We plan to use data from Allofus to validate findings from the MyCode cohort, in particular, findings from admixed populations.  Overall, we anticipate being able to validate the grs findings from the MyCode cohort and the Allofus cohort.  We will be able to compare pathogenic variants of monogenic diabetes between the cohorts and ascertain phenotypic spectrum, prevalence, and penetrance of diabetes genes.  We will use the Allofus population to validate any risk models developed.
Achieving our goals will lead to possibility of further genetic studies into the phenotype, progression and complications of diabetes subtypes.  The risk models for diabetes subtypes will be provided freely on a server and available for clinicians to use.  These tools will be applicable to individuals of all ancestries and all ages.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are interested in the conditions that accompany obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are conditions that are risk factors for OSA, so we expect to see those prior to a diagnosis of the sleep problem. There are also many comorbidities of OSA, such as cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and diabetes. We believe that there may be mechanisms underlying OSA and these comorbidities that are present before diagnosis. We therefore want to look at when co-occurring conditions occur before and after a diagnosis of OSA. We also wish to assess those conditions in people without OSA as a comparison.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (obstructive sleep apnea)","Scientific Approaches
We will look at conditions relative to the date of diagnosis of OSA. We will assess the timeline of occurrence of events (diagnosis, survey, vital) relative to OSA, and assess the conditions that occur early, simultaneously or late. We will look at the conditions commonly associated with OSA (CV disease, mental health, etc) in people without indication of a sleep disorder, and see whether the timeline and severity differs with the OSA group.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to see conditions occurring prior to a diagnosis of OSA. This would suggest 1) that we may be detecting OSA late, and that these conditions may be potentially able to help improve screening for OSA, and 2) we may identify possible underlying pathophysiology that could be present in OSA that is also contributing to other health problems.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Understanding the spectrum risks found in persons with diabetes and ASCVD in a contemporary cohort of US adults can help target the intensity of therapeutic approaches to prevent future adverse outcomes.
The project will examine the following questions:
1.	Within those with diabetes, how many are higher risk (two or more risk factors) and within those with ASCVD how many are at very high risk according to the recent 2018 cholesterol guidelines?
2.	Among these higher versus lower risk patients with ASCVD and DM, what is the adherence to non-smoking, healthy diet, and regular physical activity?
3.	Among these groups, what is the proportion at target for BP (<130/80 mmHg), LDL-C (< 70 mg/dl if CVD, <100 mg/dl otherwise), HbA1c (<8% if with CVD or <7% if not)?
4.	How does the extent of recommended medication use compare among these groups, including statins, BP medication, DM medication, antiplatelet/aspirin therapy, and influenza vaccination.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease and diabetes)","Scientific Approaches
The dataset we would like to utilize would be participants’ provided information (PPI), electronic health records (EHR) and physical measurements, which provide information about the participant’s overall health status, lifestyle, medication history, serum biochemicals and demographic characteristics.
We will categorize the sample with and without diabetes mellitus (and within diabetes those with vs, without multiple risk factors) or cardiovascular diseases (and among such persons those at high vs. very high risk), and use Chi-square test to compare the extent of adherence to lifestyle measures (in# 2 above), risk factor control (#3 above), and extent of recommended medication use (#4 above). Multiple logistic regression will be used to examine whether the extent of single and multiple risk factor control is and within these conditions, those at higher versus lower risk and use multiple logistic regression to test the behavior and risk factors difference among different groups.","Anticipated Findings

The aim of this study is to investigate if Pyridoxine use can benefit diabetics in preventing long term complications by inhibiting formation of activated glycation end products and improving clinical outcomes.
Diabetes and hyperglycemia are affecting over 415 million people worldwide, and by 2040 the number is expected to increase to 642 million. Chronic hyperglycemia results in the glycation of proteins and other biomolecules resulting in generation of AGEs. Glycation can be identified as the core reason for diabetes associated disorders. The interaction of AGEs with their receptor elicits oxidative stress and as a result evokes proliferative, inflammatory, thrombotic and fibrotic reactions in a variety of cells. Therefore, inhibiting the glycation process might be an effective way to prevent the complications of chronic hyperglycemia.","Project Purpose(s)

The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is incompletely understood. It is commonly believed that the disease encompasses several distinct entities, which we are unable to appropriately sub-classify at present. Access to large datasets with genetic and clinical phenotypic information provide an ideal opportunity to conduct analyses that might improve our understanding of T2D and related traits, particularly within underserved or underrepresented populations. We therefore have two main aims: (1) understand the genetic basis of T2D and related traits and (2) determine whether T2D might be classified into subtypes of disease.","Project Purpose(s)

To achieve these goals, we plan on performing association analyses between T2D-related traits and genetic variants typed in the All of Us cohort, extending our previous work on the genetics of T2D to diverse populations. We will also test whether the variants associated with these traits, or risk scores that combine genetic and phenotypic variables, also impact related traits/outcomes, to further characterize the impact of these variants or the disease subtypes described by them on health. We will use combinations of traits and Mendelian randomization techniques to assess causality between traits. Additionally, we will apply clustering approaches to the data in order to identify potential subtypes of T2D.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to gain a better understanding of the genetic architecture of T2D within diverse, non-white populations, advancing equity in the field of T2D genetics. Our results will: (1) generate new insights into the underlying causes of T2D, providing new clues to possible therapies, (2) greatly enrich our understanding of the genetic architecture of polygenic traits, especially focused on rare variants, and (3) improve methods for identifying subgroups within heterogeneous traits; such methods will be useful for many groups studying many different phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How do data from the All of Us database compare against known data sources that are considered to be representative of the general population and have been traditionally used in vision health surveillance activities (such as NHANES, NHIS, etc.)? How does All of Us compare to existing big-data sources such as IQVIA?
There is increasing interest in understanding how social factors impact health and vision outcomes. Social determinants of health are important considerations for disease management and prognosis, and our representative use case (diabetes and diabetic retinopathy) has huge implications for our health system as  the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment among working-age adults in the United States. By answering the above questions, we can determine whether the All of Us database is representative and may be broadly generalizable for future studies.","Project Purpose(s)
Control Set","Scientific Approaches
-	Develop standard cohort definition for diabetes
-	Develop standard cohort definition for diabetic retinopathy
-	Determine prevalence of diabetes and compare across different data sources – All of Us, NHANES, NHIS, IQVIA
o	Numerator: Number of adults with diabetes
o	Denominator: Total number of adults available in data source
-	Determine prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and compare across different data sources – All of Us, NHANES, NHIS, IQVIA
o	Numerator: Number of adults with diabetic retinopathy
o	Denominator: Total number of adults available in data source vs. total number of adults with diabetes
-	For prevalence calculations, will need to establish defined study periods and ensure consistency across data sources
-	Potential analyses:
o	Look at state/regional variations
o	Examine demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity) of cohorts across data sources
-	Identify areas of similarity/alignment vs. differences","Anticipated Findings
If we are able to demonstrate that the All of Us database is representative and aligns with existing nationwide data sources, then findings regarding links between social determinants and vision health outcomes using All of Us would be felt to be more broadly generalizable. On the other hand, if there are major discrepancies between All of Us and previously established data sources, this would be important information for the vision research community to be aware of, and this could even inform future efforts to make the database more representative.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (A2ND) contribute to the second leading cause of death worldwide and account for the majority of life-years lost to disability. As the global population ages, the prevalence and societal impact of A2ND will become ever greater with annual costs in the US expected to exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2050. The management and treatment of A2ND risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, might delay or prevent A2ND onset. To this point, an untreated risk factor generates a cascade that with time increases in complexity and ultimately results in A2ND. Our aim is to select risk factor profiles that are targetable with a drug class and assess if a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics can disrupt the risk cascade modifying A2ND onset.  We aim to include in our analyses demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, genotype, disease stage, socioeconomic status) to stratify efficacy of each therapeutic for AD prevention in a given population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (neurodegenerative disease)","Scientific Approaches
Our first analysis will examine most common A2ND diagnosis incidence rates in subjects with long-term use of a drug targeting a specific risk factor in comparison to subjects with no drug use.  We will focus, first on preventative drugs within classes such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogen modulating therapeutics, psychiatric drugs and therapeutics targeting the inflammatory and metabolic system. Factors such as race, age, gender, genotype (e.g. APOE for Alzhimer's Disease (AD))  and other co-morbidities will be used to determine populations of subjects in which this preventative effect is most pronounced. Our second analysis will evaluate possible therapeutic effects on A2ND diagnosis. For this, cognitive measures in subjects with long-term use of a therapeutic will be compared to those in subjects with no known use while accounting for variability in age, gender and race. The drug effect on cognitive scores will be examined in sub-populations defined by their genotype.","Anticipated Findings
Previous work from our group has shown benefits of treating AD risk factors with commonly used therapeutics (statins, estrogen replacement, selective estrogen receptor modulators, etc) to reduce AD onset. Of clinical importance, there may be selective benefits for  specific genotype patients with and the ability to advance a precision prevention approach for AD. Going forward, key issues to be explored are sex differences in response to therapy, genotypes and phenotypes most appropriate for a given therapy and which specific therapies have greatest preventative efficacy in the context of other variables such as sex, ApoE genotype, and other comorbidities. Results of our pilot analyses and the work proposed here will contribute to a growing body of evidence indicative of therapeutic benefit of AD risk factor treatment in a responder subset and thus have the potential to impact risk and course of Alzheimer's disease. We will extend our analysis to other neurodegenerative disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It’s estimated 5 million of the 18 million americans in the US with diabetes do not know they have it. Early diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes is important so that patients can begin to manage the disease early and potentially prevent or delay the serious disease complications that can decrease quality of life. Some of these complications include premature heart disease and stroke, blindness, limb amputations, and kidney failure. Our project will review clinical data to estimate each patient’s diabetes risk, which will help identify high risk individuals who may need to seek medical attention.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Given the importance of being able to correctly give early diagnosis, this team places a stronger importance for our model on predictive performance, which leads the team to initially lean towards using random forest or boosting (particularly XGBoost) models.  These more complex models might not be as interpretable, and take longer to run, but they generally yield a much higher out-of-sample performance, which is the main goal of this team’s project.  The team will also look into how well a CART model performs with the dataset given that a CART tree, if it is not too complex, would offer that interpretability for the end users of this research project.  It is important to note that a CART model would be used in lieu of a more complex model if it performs on par with the more complex models.","Anticipated Findings
The overall goal of the project is to assist doctors with treating patients. Ideally, the data analysis would provide doctors with a model of what age range a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on his/her risk factors. If we can provide doctors with this information, then they can have a conversation with patients about preventative care, such as lifestyle changes, in advance of that age to try to prevent patients from developing diabetes. It also allows doctors to know when to start testing patients’ A1C levels to diagnose diabetes so the disease can be treated as quickly as possible. This prevents the untreated disease from wreaking havoc on the patients’ bodies, preventing complications from diabetes down the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asian Americans recorded the fastest growth rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the US between 2019 and 2020. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension occur at high rates within the Asian American community but are masked by high socioeconomic status, education, and health insurance.  Undoubtedly, with this rapid growth, pre-existing health disparities in the Asian-American community will become magnified. Currently, Asian Americans are more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) despite having a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
Researchers have been unable to identify health trends within Asian American subgroups. In this study, we aim to examine the prevalence of T2D among the Asian American cohort of the All of Us Research Program, which may differ within each ethnic subgroup. How do the rates of T2D, as diagnosed by hemoglobin A1C, differ among Asian American racial subgroups?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a retrospective observational study with the All of Us cohort data. We plan to access the EHR of participants within Asian American subgroups. Within the EHR’s, T2D will be defined as diagnosed by a physician or measured by HA1C levels. We plan to use SPSS or R to run the statistical analysis. We plan to use a one-way ANOVA to investigate if our single independent variable, the racial subgroup, will have an effect on the dependent variable, T2D.","Anticipated Findings
The goal is to delineate health trends and disaggregate Asian American subgroups. We anticipate identifying health trends regarding the prevalence of T2D within Asian American subgroups. By identifying these trends, we hope to raise awareness of the prevalence of T2D within Asian American communities. There is currently a deficit in biomedical research regarding Asian Americans. This is especially concerning, as Asian Americans are on pace to be one of the fastest-growing racial groups in America. By identifying trends within the cohort, the results can be used to identify which groups are most susceptible to T2D, which will allow the development of better prevention strategies and optimal treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

According to the CDC, 90% of the nation's $3.5 trillion annual health care expenditures is spent on treating chronic and mental health conditions. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) provided by Registered Dietitians has been shown to be an effective and cost-effective component of treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, in small clinical studies and medical practices in hospitals. Thus, MNT could be an additional powerful medical treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. However, there is no known large-scale research that examines the effectiveness of MNT in the diseases. By leveraging the national-level data from All of Us, we hope to determine if MNT could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. If possible, we would also like to determine if specific nutrition interventions provided in MNT produce significantly better health outcomes compared to other nutrition interventions provided in MNT.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Diseases)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a prospective cohort study for individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndromes. Individuals with those diseases who have completed at least 1 MNT or no MNT will be included in the cohort. MNT is being provided by Registered Dietitians in hospitals and clinics, so data about MNT is available from the EHR. By following those individuals in the cohort over time, we will have their short-, middle-, and long-term health outcomes of the diseases. By comparing the health outcomes between individuals who completed MNT and individuals who did not, after adjusting potential confounders, we will determine if could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. Additionally, we will attempt to categorize different MNTs based on their specific nutrition interventions and determine if specific MNTs are more effective.","Anticipated Findings
The primary outcome of the study is the overall effectiveness of MNT on cardiometabolic diseases. The secondary outcome of the study is the effectiveness of specific MNTs on cardiometabolic diseases. Our finding might provide evidence that MNT is an effective treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, in addition to medications and medical surgeries. MNT provided by Registered Dietitians could be an essential part of a health care team that is responsible for treating cardiometabolic diseases, positively impacting patients' weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose control.  Additionally, since MNT is cost-effective, it could help save health care expenditures, which is beneficial to alleviate the financial burden of the diseases. Lastly, because MNT is an individualized nutrition treatment, our findings could contribute to the understanding of the effect of precision nutrition on human health, as one-size-fits-all nutritional approaches have not been very effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I plan to explore the All of Us program data to more fully develop a specific research question relating to the effects of physical activity/exercise training in individuals diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  Currently pharmacological strategies used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have not shown the same beneficial effects in individuals diagnosed with HFpEF.  Exercise has been shown to produce beneficial effects in many aspects of this very complex disease as well as in the co-morbidities frequently occurring with HFpEF (e.g. atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, etc.).  More research is needed to analyze how different clinical phenotypes of HFpEF respond to exercise training and whether exercise training is a viable strategy for the treatment and management of HFpEF.","Project Purpose(s)

Early identification of patients with undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) or those at an increased risk of developing the disease is an important public health challenge. We aim to develop a predictive model for disease transitions in T2D. This will help us gain a more accurate understanding of the combination of factors that cause the disease, allowing us to more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients. Our research aims to 1) better understand T2D disease transition and progression, 2) more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients, 3) better understand the risk factors that lead to the development of the disease and their interactions, 4) identify currently unknown risk factors, 5) gain a better understanding of which types of interventions have the greatest chance of success for impacting disease transition, either by reducing the severity of the disease, delaying its onset, or preventing it altogether.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to improve the accuracy of clinical risk factors used for modeling T2D  to inform population health interventions, individual patient care, and research discovery by integrating machine learning and cohort analyses using All of Us datasets.

The results from our study could help patients in several ways. First, a predictive model might help to more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients and identify the most effective ways to prevent the condition from developing or worsening. Second, identifying relevant risk factors (both known and unknown), as well as their interactions, may help to deliver patient interventions earlier to reduce disease outcomes. This may also help doctors and patients target the factors that are most likely to reduce or eliminate disease transition, helping to provide the best clinical outcome for patients.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex common disease that disproportionately impacts minority ethnic and racial groups. Socioeconomic deprivation (SED) is widely considered to be a risk factor for T2D disparities. In 2021, the effect of genetic ancestry (GA) on such disparities was studied using data from the United Kingdom (UK) to reveal an interaction. The study found that both SED and non-European GA were significantly associated with the observed T2D disparities, with GA showing a stronger effect than SED in the overall population. GA and SED show significant interaction effects on T2D, with SED being a greater risk factor for T2D for individuals with South Asian and African ancestry, compared to those with European ancestry. This study underscored how the effects of environmental risk factors can differ among ancestry groups, suggesting the need for group-specific interventions. We intend to conduct a similar study using more diverse data from the United States' All of Us project.","Project Purpose(s)

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. Is idiopathic achalasia associated with other medical conditions that lead to microvascular damage (e.g. type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis etc.)?
Esophageal achalasia is an idiopathic, rare disorder characterized by degeneration of neurons of the myenteric plexus of the esophagus. Gastroparesis, which functionally resembles achalasia and affects diabetic patients, is hypothesized to occur due to nerve ischemia from microvascular damage secondary to diabetes. Studies on achalasia have been largely limited due to the rarity of the condition, but understanding whether a relationship exists between achalasia and disorders that cause vascular damage could help inform guidelines on preventive care given how common some of these conditions are in the U.S. population (e.g. type II diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, autoimmune conditions).","Project Purpose(s)

Then they will be compared to patients without diagnosed esophageal achalasia and compared on their prevalence of type II diabetes, type I diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, malignancy, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematous, and IBD. I will also perform a subanalysis by race for the risks given the limited data on achalasia and hypothesized HLA predispositions. Means will be compared between cohorts using a Student’s t-test.

It is anticipated that most, if not all of these conditions leading to microvascular damage, will be represented to a greater extent in the achalasia group compared to the control group. Regardless, any information gathered would be very helpful in leading to a greater understanding of esophageal achalasia, which is poorly understood. Information on associations by race would also be very valuable as little data exists on the topic given the rarity of the condition.

Understanding the spectrum risks found in persons with diabetes and ASCVD in a contemporary cohort of US adults can help target the intensity of therapeutic approaches to prevent future adverse outcomes.

I plan to explore the All of Us program data to more fully develop a specific research question relating to the effects of physical activity/exercise training in individuals diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  Currently pharmacological strategies used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have not shown the same beneficial effects in individuals diagnosed with HFpEF.  Exercise has been shown to produce beneficial effects in many aspects of this very complex disease as well as in the co-morbidities frequently occurring with HFpEF (e.g. atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, etc.).  More research is needed to analyze how different clinical phenotypes of HFpEF respond to exercise training and whether exercise training is a viable strategy for the treatment and management of HFpEF.","Project Purpose(s)

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Childhood obesity can continue into adulthood and is known to be a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases . Preventing childhood obesity has been actively pursued in pediatric programs. However, decades of rigorous research have shown that prevention and management of obesity is not easy. This is partly due to our limited understating of obesity and the complex interactions among a myriad of various factors, including biological and environmental ones, that are known to contribute to obesity.

The long-term goal of this Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) pilot project is to identify genetic loci associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although diabetes and hypertension are primary risk factors for CKD, genetic factors have also been associated with CKD-defining traits. In this study, we will examine genome sequence variation among individuals in diagnosed with CKD with those not diagnosed with CKD. Our project seeks to: 1) identify putative genetic loci that increase risk for CKD that have not been previously reported; 2) examine associations between known CKD risk loci among individuals in study; and 3) compare genetic data with other CKD studies as a way of assessing whether individuals included in the study are a representative cohort of CKD subjects.

We plan to conduct a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  To conduct this study, we will combine de-identified data we plan to generate for 100 CKD patients from Maine with All of Us data. We plan to use All of Us data for both cases and controls. The overall statistical analysis approach consists of three components as follows. First, we will analyze distributions of relevant clinical data from participants, such as eGFR and age separated by sex. Second, we will analyze population stratification using ADMIXTURE (Shringapure et al, 2016) and PLINK (Purcell et al, 2007) to identify any subpopulations that differ genetically and if disease prevalence differs among those subpopulations (Marchini et al, 2004). Distributions of alleles among participants will be compared to reference panels in order to estimate individual ancestry proportions. For the GWAS analysis, genetic associations will be tested using PLINK.","Anticipated Findings

Aevus is engineering a ML -powered Prescription Guidance Platform - Aevus Precision Rx for Endocrinologists/PCPs  to tailor prescriptions for Type 2 diabetes patients. In doing so, Aevus intends to improve T2D  drug outcomes, reduce medication switching and lower treatment costs. There are 11 drug classes used to treat T2D with over 100 different medications for a doctor to choose from prior to prescribing a treatment plan to a patient. The doctor is thus faced with a problem of plenty - On average, it takes an Endocrinologist/PCP 18-24 months to arrive at a stable drug compound and dosage of that compound to treat a T2D patient. A portion of the astronomical health care spending also goes into treating Adverse Drug Reactions, which are frequent and drain the health system of $3.5 B annually. Precision Rx will act as a real-time point-of-care clinical decision support tool that will interface as a software between the physician and the EHR.","Project Purpose(s)

The goal of our modelling outcome is to generate a scale that will rank the 11 drug classes used to treat Type 2 Diabetes in decreasing order of potential toxicity to the patient. The above mentioned overarching ML model will comprise of several sub-ML models, the ensemble of which will produce an umbrella model that can rank all the drug classes. Each sub-model will tackle the question of 'Is drug class X suitable for unique patient XYZ or not?'. Precision Rx is intended to be a tool that can easily integrate into the existing clinical workflow of a physician with minimal change to their routine. There have been some advancements in the space of automated clinical decision support for Type 2 Diabetes in the past - tools like Epocrates have EHR integration capabilities that allow for physicians to make more accurate prescription decisions based purely off ADA guidelines. These are thus static tools that are not making use of EHR and Big Data Analysis to make a more data-driven decision","Demographic Categories of Interest

We plan to use the electronic health records (EHR) data as real world evidence to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis. Specifically, we will get the EHR of all individuals who have been diagnosed with hypertension and are first time users of antihypertensive monotherapies. We will then match the cohorts with propensity score matching and conduct cost-effectiveness analysis on all pairwise combinations of drugs with respect to a number of outcomes including: QALY and ICER.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that for most disease/secondary outcomes there is no major difference between different classes or active ingredients of antihypertensives especially for the short term outcome of 5 years.

Diabetes, cardiovascualar diseases and dementia are the major challenges to human health, which are determined by genetic susceptibility, environmental risk factors, and their interactions. However, the evidence on the G×E (genetic facotrs* environmental factors) interaction and unconfounded estimates of a modifiable exposure is still laking. This study plan aim to investigate whether modifiable factors for such disease may interact with the genetic variations in relation to risks of diabetes, cardiovascualar diseases and dementia.","Project Purpose(s)
