The project aims to investigate the prevalence and occurrence rate of women having a high body mass index during pregnancy who have a high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in the U.S. population concerning the variety present within the United States including age groups, races, ethnicities, geographical regions, education level, and income level. This study will demonstrate the association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the later stages of pregnancy and also explore the impact at various levels of maternal BMI on the development of GDM among pregnant women in the later stages of pregnancy. This will help to promote health equity among different demographic and clinical subgroups provide endorsement and potential guidance to scientists and clinical management and optimize patient care in the U.S. population.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use the All of Us study, controlled tire dataset v7. Participants with a high BMI will be identified based on WHO cutoffs. The eligibility criteria are based on females assigned at birth, aged 18-49 years who are pregnant. The prevalence of participants will be estimated by subpopulation based on age groups, races, ethnicities, geographical regions, education level, and income level. The dataset will be checked for normality, descriptive characteristics[For continuous: median (IQR) and for categorical n(%)], and association.will be established. The Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated by using binomial regression for all GDM individuals. P-value<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.","Anticipated Findings
The study may identify specific thresholds or categories of maternal BMI during pregnancy that are related to higher or lower risks of developing GDM in the later stages of pregnancy. So, it can contribute to risk stratification and help in developing the goal interventions for high-risk individuals.
The findings enhance the timing of BMI assessment during pregnancy concerning GDM risk.
Moreover, this work may reveal the potential impact of maternal BMI during pregnancy on neonatal health outcomes and It is expected that maternal BMI levels associated with increased GDM risk may also be linked to adverse neonatal outcomes. The anticipated findings could have important clinical implications for prenatal care and GDM management. Healthcare providers may use the results to inform risk assessment protocols and develop personalized care plans for pregnant women based on their BMI status.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program. Chronic disease is a rising contributor to mortality and morbidity, and many chronic disease risk factors are modifiable. Learning how we can more effectively prevent and control chronic disease among diverse patient populations will be essential for population health improvement. We specifically plan to study the intersection between different chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that interact with one another and cause progressive disability.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use a combination of descriptive tools (e.g. estimating prevalence, incidence of various conditions) and modeling tools to model the accumulation of disease risk factors and mortality. Our work will be performed primarily using All of Us data with additional work performed in other population-based data sources including EHR data, UK Biobank, and other large studies.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our study will document the prevalence and risk of developing various types of multimorbidity and chronic disease burden over time and will identify novel risk factors for multimorbidity which could be targeted both to improve population health and to improve health equity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

What metrics of discrimination or factors create an adverse social determinants of health profile relevant to the diagnosis and presence of type 2 diabetes? Using an aggregated genetic risk score, are impacts similar for variants linked to functional categories of type 2 diabetes, such as body fat or beta cell function related variants? What, if any, SDOH have an affect on diagnosis and presence of type 2 diabetes?
These are exploratory questions as this workspace will be used to identify any possible metrics of discrimination when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes. I hope to use this workspace to come to a better understanding on if SDOH have similar impacts of genetic risk scores when determining risk for type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I would like to use any participant-level data that includes risk scores and social determinants found to be relevant to type 2 diabetes.

Hundreds of genetic variants have been linked with diabetes and related metabolic conditions, including for obesity, type-two diabetes, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin).. However, the biological pathways by which they act is not yet clear, nor have all causal genetic variants been identified, especially those in the fewest individuals. We intend to run genome-wide association studies between these phenotypes (e.g. individuals who suffer from diabetes versus those who do not, or BMI as a continuous trait), and other diabetes-related phenotypes (HbA1c, glucose etc) against genetic variants from the Whole Genome Sequencing data. Our results will improve the field’s understanding of the biological pathways for these conditions. The All of Us data set is crucial for answering these questions, due to its diverse genetic ancestry. Whole genome sequencing contains nearly all genetic variants, down to the rarest (<1% of individuals), which aids our ability to identify causal genetic mutations.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the software tool REGENIE to perform our analysis, which rigorously controls for known confounders. Our association analyses will be performed using the most recent release of whole-genome sequencing data. We will also perform downstream analyses, such as Fine Mapping, which inform us about which variants are and are not causal.","Anticipated Findings

Delirium, a severe medical condition prevalent among older patients, is often linked to various risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), potentially due to shared mechanisms increasing dementia susceptibility. Intriguingly, research suggests that metformin, a medication for DM, not only extends lifespan but also reduces delirium risk in DM patients. Additionally, exploring metformin's effects on genome-wide DNA methylation have shed light on its mechanisms, including pathways related to longevity, AMPK, inflammation, and HIF-1 alpha. However, a deeper understanding of metformin's role in longevity and its impact on delirium risk is warranted. To address this gap, our study aims to investigate metformin's potential influence on delirium risk as well as mortality risk, and also investigate genetic profiles modulating such potential association by examining genome-wide genetic status in patients with and without a history of delirium.","Project Purpose(s)

Dataset: All of Us Controlled Data v07
Tools: R
Research methods:
- Investigate the prevalence of delirium among individuals with and without a history of metformin use, stratified by the status for diabetes mellitus.
- Compare the frequency of SNP alleles related to delirium as a trait among the population first. Then we evaluate the difference of such potential association between participants who have used metformin and those who have not to investigate the potential interaction between genotype and medical use history.","Anticipated Findings
Conducting the described research study could yield several anticipated findings that can contribute significantly to the field of delirium, pharmacogenomics, and the potential interaction between medication use and genetic predispositions. Findings may reveal a lower prevalence of delirium among individuals with a history of metformin use compared to those without such a history, particularly among those with diabetes mellitus. In addition, findings might indicate a differential effect of metformin on individuals with different genetic predispositions towards delirium. Overall, the anticipated findings from this research study could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between metformin use, genetic factors, and the pathophysiology of delirium, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical care, risk assessment, and potentially the development of targeted interventions for preventing or managing delirium in at-risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are commonly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, the response rate is relatively low. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by various germline and somatic mutations and their roles in patients' response to ICIs therapy are not well understood. We seek to use All-of-Us data to identify potential correlations/association between germline genomic alterations and tumor sensitivity to ICIs. We believe gene/drug interactions with medicines used to treat chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and COPD) may also associate with response of NSCLC to ICI. Thus, appropriate management of co-morbid conditions may improve response to ICI in NSCLC patients.","Project Purpose(s)

The second or second level of the primary cohort are those patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer, treatment with ICIs, genomic data, and who have drug codes associated with medications to control co-morbid inflammatory conditions ( hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, diabetes, and obesity).
We will  establish a timeline for outcomes through timestamps provided in the data during the analysis phase using R or Python processing.

This study aims to integrate polygenic scores and pharmacogenetics to investigate drug interactions, enhancing personalized medicine. Polygenic scores, summarizing genetic predispositions for peripheral biomarkers or disease risk factors, combined with pharmacogenetic data—how genetic variation affects drug response—can offer insights into individual drug efficacy and safety. We focus on statins, hypertensive drugs, and hyperglycemic agents. For instance, specific genetic variants influence statin metabolism, potentially causing side effects like myopathy. Similarly, genetic factors affect hypertensive drug efficacy, such as beta-blockers in individuals with certain genotypes showing less blood pressure reduction. For hyperglycemic drugs, genetic variations can predict response to metformin, guiding optimal diabetes management. This research will elucidate genetic factors underlying drug interactions, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Our research will utilize large-scale genomic datasets in All of Us with genetic profiles and detailed medication histories. We'll analyze polygenic scores—aggregated from millions of genetic variants associated with clinical biomarkers —and pharmacogenetic markers relevant to drug metabolism and efficacy. For statins, hypertensive, and hyperglycemic drugs, we'll examine specific genetic markers that modulate drug metabolism enzymes (e.g., CYP450 variants) and transporters (e.g., SLCO1B1 for statins). Tools like Hail for working with large genomics datasets, statsmodels in Python for statistical analysis and machine learning, and PharmGKB database for pharmacogenetics information will be pivotal.","Anticipated Findings
Our goal is to understand if integrating polygenics with pharmacogenetics can identify patients who would benefit from tailored or alternative therapies. For example, consider integrating a polygenic score for LDL cholesterol with a pharmacogenomic alleles in SLCO1B1. Polygenic scores aggregate the effects of numerous genetic variants associated with LDL cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, the SLCO1B1 gene encodes a liver transporter protein that significantly influences statin drug metabolism; certain variants in this gene are linked to increased risk of statin-induced myopathy. For individuals with a high polygenic score for LDL cholesterol, indicating a genetic predisposition to high LDL levels, statins might be essential for managing cardiovascular risk. However, if these individuals also carry a risk allele in SLCO1B1, they might be at a higher risk for adverse reactions from standard statin doses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Over half of all American adults ≥18 years of age are living with one or more chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many experience multiple symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, depressed mood, anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath) either related to the chronic condition and/or its treatment. Symptom clusters are defined as two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Symptom clusters are challenging to manage and burden both the patient and healthcare system. However, symptom clusters in chronic conditions are understudied and poorly understood. We believe that we can generate new knowledge to improve patient symptom management by using All of Us data. We plan to perform data-driven characterization of symptom clusters in patients diagnosed with one or more chronic conditions and explore predictors (e.g., clinical, genetic, and environmental biomarkers) of different symptom clusters.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Chronic conditions (e.g., cancer, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD))","Scientific Approaches
We will use All of Us Research Program participant data, including electronic health record domains (e.g., conditions, drug exposures, labs & measurement), survey questions (e.g., basics, overall health, lifestyle, personal medical history, health care access & utilization), physical measurements, wearables, and genetic information, and statistical analysis methods (e.g., factor analysis, cluster analysis, regression) to characterize chronic condition symptom clusters and explore predictors of symptom clusters in patients diagnosed with chronic conditions.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study include symptom cluster(s) for various chronic conditions and predictors of the symptom clusters. We hypothesize that a core set of symptom clusters is shared among all common chronic conditions. We further hypothesize that distinct symptom clusters characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. We hope that this study will help us to understand physiological mechanisms underlying symptom development and lead to improved patient symptom management.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This research aims to elucidate the genetic etiology of obesity. Specifically, we intend to assess the relationship between certain genetic variants and the incidence of obesity, as well as how these genetic factors interact with environmental and lifestyle factors to influence individual body weight.
Obesity is a major global health challenge, associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of obesity will advance our knowledge of how to better predict, prevent, and treat this condition. It will also contribute to the development of personalized medicine and public health interventions that could ameliorate the impact of obesity on society.","Project Purpose(s)

Utilizing the All of Us dataset, which includes genomic data alongside environmental and lifestyle information, we will apply bioinformatics tools to correlate specific alleles with obesity phenotypes. Our analysis will involve statistical methods to control for confounding factors and to ensure robustness of the genetic associations.

Our approach is integrative, leveraging the rich, multidimensional data of the All of Us cohort to yield insights into the complex interplay between genetics and obesity.","Anticipated Findings

We hope to use a dataset consisting of cancer patients. Since some cancer treatments possess more of a cardiovascular burden to patients, we will likely look into patients with cancers that are treated with such regimens (eg. breast cancer). We will then stratify these patients by sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk to assess how control of cardiovascular disease (ie lipid control) may help inform chemotherapeutic treatment plans.","Anticipated Findings
Cardio-oncology is a new interdisciplinary field intended to provide a more holistic approach to caring for cancer patients.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications. There is a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.

Diabetes stands as one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases, exerting a disproportionate impact on both sex and racial/ethnic minority populations. While numerous studies have investigated the correlation between social determinants of health and diabetes, a significant gap persists in our comprehension of the most pertinent factors within the intricate landscape of social determinants of health datasets related to diabetes.
1)	What are the primary social determinants of health factors associated with diabetes across diverse populations?
2)	How do these factors vary in their impact on diabetes within specific sex and race/ethnicity groups?
By addressing these pivotal questions, our research endeavors to refine our understanding of the complex relationship between social determinants of health and diabetes outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To address this gap, there is a critical need for sophisticated computational modeling, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms capable of handling high-dimensional data in large datasets, to account for social determinants of health  factors in diabetes. We will use supervised ML approaches to examine the associations of individual health factors and neighborhood factors in relation to Diabetes . The supervised ML approach is appropriate because it seeks patterns in the training data and uses that information to make predictions for unseen data without relying on strict model distributions. Four different tree-based machine learning algorithms including: 1) Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, 2) Decision Tree, 3) Random tree, and 4) Gradient Boosting Machines (gbm) will be used to compare their performance in predicting the risk of Diabetes. The root mean squared error and sensitivity analysis will serve as primary indicators of predictive accuracy.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated outcomes of our study hold the promise of making significant strides in comprehending and mitigating health disparities among minority populations, with a specific focus on predicting the risk of diabetes. We envisage that the development of a predictive framework will play a pivotal role in identifying the key determinants of diabetes.
We anticipate two distinct outcomes from our research: Firstly, we aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between neighborhood environmental factors and diabetes. This understanding will contribute substantially to the refinement of targeted interventions and strategies for the prediction of race/ethnicity- and sex-specific risks associated with diabetes. Secondly, our study aims to pinpoint the key determinants that influence race/ethnicity- and sex-specific disparities in the realm of diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MASLD represents a spectrum of liver pathology ranging from simple steatosis to metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, commonly used in the management of T2DM, have shown promise in improving metabolic parameters and possibly influencing hepatic outcomes in MASLD. However, the long-term effects of these medications on HCC incidence in patients with MASLD remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following the use of GLP-1 agonists in patients diagnosed with steatotic liver disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hepatocellular carcinoma)","Scientific Approaches
Data Source: AllofUs participants diagnosed with fatty liver disease/steatotic liver disease and prescribed GLP-1 agonists between TBD dates.
Study Population: Patients aged 18 years and above with a diagnosis of fatty liver disease (MASLD, MASH, NAFLD or NASH) confirmed via imaging or histology, who have been prescribed GLP-1 agonists for at least one year during the study period.
Outcome Measure: The primary outcome is the incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients exposed to GLP-1 agonists compared to those not exposed.
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will summarize baseline characteristics. The incidence of HCC will be calculated per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for potential confounders.","Anticipated Findings
This study hypothesizes that GLP-1 agonists may have a protective effect against the development of HCC in patients with fatty liver disease due to their metabolic benefits. However, there is also a possibility that GLP-1 agonists may influence hepatic carcinogenesis through alternative mechanisms. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the long-term hepatocellular outcomes associated with the use of GLP-1 agonists in patients with fatty liver disease. Understanding the potential impact of GLP-1 agonists on hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in patients with fatty liver disease is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies in this population. The findings from this study may inform clinical decision-making and contribute to the growing body of evidence on the role of GLP-1 agonists in liver-related outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a highly polygenic disease, has been progressively increasing to epidemic proportions. We are constructing risk prediction tools for T2D and complications that could help guide clinicians implement personalized screening and management approaches to prevent T2D and complications. The integration of polygenic risk scores (PRS) into risk prediction models enhances the performance of these models. Yet the T2D prediction models that consider both clinical risks and T2D PRS fail to account for the underlying heterogeneous pathophysiology of T2D.
We hypothesize that classification models, trained on a large data set and validated on a diverse group of patients, that exhaust the genetic risk for the pathologies involved in T2D development along with the clinical and environmental risk factors will provide more accurate predictions and guide individualized interventions to prevent both T2D and its multiple complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
Our hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims:
Aim 1. To develop a classification model for predicting T2D based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
After identifying individuals with T2D as well as all relevant clinical and lifestyle risk factors and calculating the PRS for T2D and relevant risk factors, we will use a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm for classification. We will then select the top features associated with the disease and use them to build a simplified prediction model.
Aim 2. To develop classification models for predicting T2D complications based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
We will identify people with T2D microvascular (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy) and macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease) complications. Multiple PRS for risk factors of each complication, T2D PRS, and the targeted complication PRS will be integrated into the classification model.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study will improve risk prediction by taking account of the genetic risks of the underlying pathologies involved in the development of T2D and complications as well as the clinical and lifestyle risk factors. We except the classification models for T2D and complication to achieve high predictability in diverse populations. We expect to determine the key risk factors for T2D complications and use them to build simplified focused classification models that will help clinicians make person-centered screening and management decisions to prevent complications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genetic studies have focused almost exclusively on excess risk for poor health, yet there is considerable ethnic heterogeneity in African derived populations such that not all Black/African Americans (B/AA) have poor type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated comorbidities. Variants in the engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) gene have been previously associated with protection against end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) due to T2D in a B/AA case-control cohort. Leak et al. (Ann Hum Genet. 2009; 73(2):152-9) performed the first comprehensive evaluation of variations across ELMO1 gene in a large B/AA T2D-ESRD case-control population and identified that the minor allele of four intronic variants showed protection, with odds ratios between 0.77-0.84.
This study will assess the replication of association of previously discovered ELMO1 variants with T2D-ESRD, as well as further refine the location of associations within the ~126kb region.","Project Purpose(s)

We propose to perform a case-control association study using the 26,405 genetic variants spanning introns 8 through 15 of the ELMO1 gene (GRCh38 coordinates chr7: 37133234-37259180) in B/AA case-control participants B/AA cases (diagnosis of T2D-ESRD) and controls (without a current diagnosis of T2D and ESRD) will be used for the current analysis.
Tests of association under the three a priori genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) will be reported. T2D-ESRD phenotypes (microalbuminuria, eGFR, creatinine, etc) will be performed using a series of analysis of variance. SNPs that showed nominal evidence for association will be further adjusted for age, sex, and genome-wide principal components.
Adjusted multivariable linear regression and unconditional logistic regression analyses will be performed.","Anticipated Findings
To our knowledge, the ELMO1 is the first candidate gene reported to show protection against T2D-ESRD in B/AAs. Hence, we aim to confirm and extend the previous report of associations between ELMO1 variants with T2D-ESRD and quantitative traits in B/AA.

Aim 1: What are the factors influencing early onset (before age 45), co-morbid peripheral artery disease in Black and White patients with diabetes?
Aim 2: What is the relationship between the screening practices and limb amputation in patients with diabetes and concomitant peripheral artery disease?
Aim 3: What factors influence practice decisions to amputate a lower limb in Black and nonblack patients in the United States?
Rationale: Evidence suggests that Black patients have a higher prevalence of asymptomatic PAD and are less aware of symptoms. This issue collectively puts them at increased risk for a delay in care. Black persons diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in midlife ages (45-64) while white persons were diagnosed with kidney disease in later life (65-74), partially attributable to better access to control diabetes. It is anticipated that this will also hold true for PAD.","Project Purpose(s)

Study Design: The proposed observational cohort study using the All of Us (AoU) Researcher Workbench.
Sampling Frame: Data from 2018 through the most currently available date at the time of study initiation.
Inclusion Criteria: Participants with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes, at least 18 years of age at the time of agreement to participate in the AoU initiative.
Exclusion Criteria: Any record without a documentation of race
Estimated Sample Size and Power calculation: This is an observational study using an established database. Our previous research using this data source found an estimated 202,000 persons with Type
Type II diabetes in AoU Data Workbench. Based on CDC reporting,6 9% (an estimated 18,180 of the AoU records), of persons with Type II diabetes also will have PAD, and of these 4.6% (an estimated 836 of the AoU records) will possibly have a limb amputation. These are adequately large numbers to support statistical analyses of the proposed hypotheses.","Anticipated Findings
H1A: A decrease in the documentation of screening for PAD will be associated with a higher rate of limb amputations among Black patients compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
H1B: A decrease in the documentation of screening for PAD will be associated with a higher rate of limb amputations in Black patients with diabetes less than 45 years of age compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
H2: An increase in the documentation of vascular treatment services will be associated with a decrease in limb amputations at all stages of diabetes with concomitant PAD.
H3: An increase in the documentation of screening for PAD using an ankle brachial index (ABI) will be associated with a decrease in rate of limb amputations.

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults in the US. In 2021, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy reached 26.43% in the US. The random survival forest, a machine learning method, is a robust prediction approach. However, its accuracy in predicting the development of diabetic retinopathy compared to the traditional Cox proportional hazards regression method remains unclear. Our aims are to:
(a)	Identify risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
(b)	Develop a random survival forest model to predict the onset of diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM

Retrospectively, we will construct a cohort of individuals with T2DM and follow up the cohort for the development of diabetic retinopathy, including non-proliferative, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema. We will extract data on demographic and clinical information, blood glucose control, blood pressure control, and lipid control for this cohort. Then we will use logistic regression to identify risk factors for diabetic retinopathy using cohort data. Subsequently, we will use risk factors along with the cohort data to train and test prediction models, which include Cox proportional hazards regression model and random survival forest model. For the random survival forest model, we will find the optimal set of hyperparameters using k-fold cross validation and grid search cross-validation. Finally, we will compare the predictive performance of the models using the Harrell’s C-index and the integrated Brier score.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that variables such as diabetes duration, fasting blood glucose, hypertension, total cholesterol are risk factors for diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, we anticipate that the random survival forest model will outperform the Cox proportional hazards regression model in predicting the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM. By leveraging the big data from the All of Us Research Program and applying machine learning technology, we will develop an accurate prediction model that can facilitate the identification of individuals with high risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment. As predicting treatment response is complex and involves multiple different factors, the All of Us cohort provides a unique opportunity to study all these factors and use them to create a ML algorithm.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I plan on exploring the All of Us dataset to identify the number of participants taking antipsychotics, and the ways in which drug response can be defined for them. It will be important to have long-term response data for the participants. Once a cohort has been created, I will analyze it using machine learning tools such as support vector machines and random forest, which are supervised machine learning methods. Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The APOE gene has long been associated with Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the apoE2 allele of this gene has been heavily correlated with high triglyceride levels and is the known cause of a genetic disorder called type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Does the presence of APOE mutations significantly influence the development, progression, and management of diabetes mellitus across different populations? This will be a comprehensive investigation of the association between APOE gene variants and diabetes risk, glycemic control, insulin resistance, and complications of diabetes. The findings of this investigation could help to predict the risk of diabetes mellitus in people who carry the APOE mutations.","Project Purpose(s)

In this workspace, based on our results generated from French participants, we aim to confirm associations between rare, loss-of-function or gain-of-function DNA variants and the risk of metabolic disorders (or the level of associated traits) using All of Us. The rare variants will be located either i/ in coding exons from candidate genes involved in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or in associated traits, or ii/ in non-coding genomic loci. To assess the functional effect of DNA variants we will either use in silico and/or in vitro studies. This project should lead to the identification or confirmation of functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the following datasets: whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA arrays
For WES and WGS, the analysis will be focused on rare variants in specific loci  (specific genes or specific non coding regions).or interest. DNA arrayswill be used for the calculation of genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for metabolic disorders or traits.
Genetic association analyses will be done between genetic markers (rare variants and/or PRS) and metabolic traits, when adjusting for relevant covariates (including sex, age, ancestry for instance).
Of note, to refine the analyses, we will use a functional genetic approach focusing on rare variants found in All of Us. For these in vitro studies, we have notably developed genome editing (i.e. CRISPR/cas9) in several human cell lines, which enables the functional analyses of small genomic regions (like an entire enhancer) or even of a single point mutation.","Anticipated Findings
This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neurodevelopment (including conditions like autism and ADHD), genetic markers of such conditions, and neurodegeneration (including dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s). We will examine the role of several intervenable targets between neurodevelopmental and neurodegeneration. These lifestyle factors are known to impact neurodegeneration in the general population, but their role in people with neurodevelopmental conditions is unknown. The purpose of examining these factors is to examine if the risk of cognitive decline may be mitigated via improvements to these targets. These include cardiometabolic health (including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes), cognitive reserve (including higher education levels), physical activity, and accelerated biological aging.","Project Purpose(s)

We will compare rates of neurodegenerative disorders across people with genetic liability for autism, ADHD, and ID, identified via polygenic risk scores, which will be expressed as a z-score based on the mean/standard deviation. We will examine data across the life course for evidence that genetic risk for neurodevelopmental conditions is linked to neurodegeneration and we will estimate the genetic correlation between the two using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression. We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle. We will use DNA methylation data to construct epigenetic clocks to examine accelerated aging. We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings
Preliminary studies have suggested neurodegeneration may be more pronounced in people with neurodevelopmental conditions. The ultimate purpose of this research is to increase understanding of neurodegeneration risk in people with neurodevelopmental conditions, with an eye towards modifiable factors. We will also examine the genetic link between genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, which may illuminate causal pathways to neurodegeneration. Using high-resolution phenotyping available in All of Us uniquely allows the examination of early-onset degeneration. This is important, as early-onset degeneration may be a target for intervention. Other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and cardiovascular health, may also be important targets for intervention. These explorations hope to improve public health.

We wish to investigate what are there are genetic determinants or risk factors of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is a common infertility disorder affecting approximately 8-13% of women who are of reproductive-age. While common, PCOS is also a complex and multifactorial disease without a clear genetic cause. PCOS overlaps with other diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndromes. It is not clear if these associated diseases are caused by or are consequences of PCOS, or if PCOS and these other disease collectively have a common cause. In addition, women with PCOS have negative body image perceptions, low self-esteem, depression, and decreased quality of life. There is a need to increase knowledge surrounding the risk factors and determinants of PCOS to improve risk identification, disease diagnosis, and disease treatment and management options.","Project Purpose(s)

We will explore PCOS correlations in different cohort groups such as age, genetic ancestry, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, geography, if applicable. We will also look at correlations of the genetics between PCOS and other diseases starting with known associated diseases such like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Lifespan diabetes and diabetes complications)","Scientific Approaches
To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations.  Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for many other complex diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide.  T2DM is associated with a variety of major health complications and affects individuals of different ethnicities and genetic ancestries.  The onset and progression of T2DM can be significantly influenced by personal behaviors, environmental factors and genetic variation.  In this study, we aim to identify the genetic risk factors associated with T2DM for people with different genetic ancestries and ethnicities.  Identifying genetic risk factors for T2DM is important because they can help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease and potentially develop new treatments and prevention strategies to advance precision medicine.

These new methods are complementary to the well-known Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and can identify disease-associated genetic variants that are often missed by GWAS.  We have used one such method successfully, employing the relatively small dataset that was then available, to identify dozens of previously unknown genes that are potentially associated with T2DM.  We plan to apply this method to the larger datasets now available in All of US to analyze people with T2DM to those without in a way that accounts for both ancestry and gender.","Anticipated Findings
Using our newly developed genetic analytical methods and the larger datasets available in All of US, we expect to identify more genes that are associated with T2DM.

Finally, I'll leverage machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks, to enhance predictive capabilities, identify key features, and effectively model complex interactions","Anticipated Findings
The overarching hypothesis is that the multidimensional whole health index will significantly outperform traditional risk models for chronic disease prediction. Additionally, it's anticipated that certain whole health domains might emerge as particularly strong predictors for specific chronic diseases (e.g., the role of social isolation in cardiovascular health). Crucially, the study aims to unveil how variations in whole health metrics align with patterns of chronic disease distribution across demographic groups, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms driving health disparities. These findings have the potential to revolutionize how we approach chronic disease risk assessment, going beyond isolated risk factors to a more holistic and personalized framework. The identified key whole health metrics will pinpoint crucial areas for targeted interventions at both the individual and population health level.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize that we can reduce the gap in the performance of PRSs between diverse populations by developing methods to generate PRSs for populations of diverse ancestry.  All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program. We will meta-analyze the available genotype data along with similar data from dbGaP and additional datasets to improve performance of PRSs in African American, Latino, and Asian populations.","Project Purpose(s)

In this project we would like to explore risk factors and associations between dental caries and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and identify genetic factors that are associated with both. We hypothesize that dental caries is associated with higher CAC scores in the presence of caries that we plan to test via regression models, adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, ancestry, social determinants of health, and smoking habits.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. CAD is a chronic condition characterized by lipids, glycocomponents, and calcium depositions that thicken the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, that leads to atherosclerotic plaque buildup. Different CAD risk factors have been established, including lifestyle and genetic markers. Poor periodontal health has been reported as associated with CAD but not as much is known about the association between CAD and dental caries and additional quantitative markers of poor oral health.

Are there specific genetic variants associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients with diabetes?
What is the prevalence of cardiovascular genetic risk factors among the diabetic Hispanic population?
Studying genetic variations linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes individuals, especially in the Hispanic community, is essential for progressing personalize care and improving health outcomes. Identifying distinct genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is the first step in developing personalized prevention and treatment approaches, especially in minority groups like US Hispanics. Further, a better understanding genetic predisposition may improve our biological understanding of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and facilitate specific therapies to lessen the burden of cardiovascular problems in this at-risk population.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Cohort selection: Create cohort of diabetic patients in the All of Us program. We will then identify patients who develop the outcome of interest (the presence of cardiovascular disease [CVD]).  Data collection: Data will be collected from the All of Us database. The data should include demographic details, clinical parameters, individuals' genetics and outcomes related to diabetes and CVD.
Generating Descriptive statistics of the population:
Statistical Analysis: The use of statistical software (eg. Python) to generate descriptive statistics for the diabetes cohort. It will include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
Candidate gene study to identify if candidate SNPs (rs6923761, rs57922, rs9299870) are associated with risk of CVD in diabetes patients. This will involve the association of these SNPs within cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings: Specific genetic variations, interacting with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling system, provide a complex risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We anticipate that genetic variations in the GLP-1 signaling system may impact the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists by affecting insulin production, glucose metabolism, and atherosclerosis as well as overall cardiovascular risk. The study's findings are anticipated to improve our comprehension of why specific diabetes patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and how their reaction to therapy can differ depending on genetic factors. This method not only seeks to enhance scientific understanding but also strives to tackle healthcare inequalities and enhance public health results by customizing interventions to suit the unique requirements of individual patients, according to their genetic makeup.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genetic association studies have identified hundreds of genetic susceptibility alleles for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, genetic association and fine mapping have primarily focused on genetic variation that can be genotyped or imputed using SNP arrays or short-read sequencing, namely single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small indels. Including the full spectrum of genetic variation in diabetes association analyses may reveal novel disease mechanisms at known diabetes loci.

I will impute SV variants in these cohorts in diabetes regions. I will then perform discovery and fine mapping for diabetes associations using SNV and imputed SV genotypes.
Additionally, to explore potential evidence of somatic instability at diabetes associated SVs, we will investigate allelic heterogeneity of long reads overlapping these regions.

Research question: Are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) associated with a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes?
Rationale: GLP-1RAs, commonly prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity, have recently gained attention for their anti-inflammatory effects in several organs, including the retina. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive retinal disease and the most common cause of blindness in developed countries. There are no current treatments for the most common form of AMD, known as “dry” AMD, which accounts for 85-90% of cases. Both in “dry” and “wet” AMD forms, chronic inflammation is central for promoting the degenerative process. Thus, GLP-1RAs present a potential therapeutic option for AMD.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to build a cohort of patients with diabetes aged 40 and older, with no prior AMD diagnosis.

3.	How do the genetic variants we find influence weight ? do they alter how we grow in childhood ?, the speed at which we put on weight ?, in which parts of the body we put excess weight ? how we respond to weight loss interventions ?
4.	How do the genetic variants we find help us understand the consequences of excess weight ? Can we use them to find out why people may develop obesity related conditions such as metabolic diseases (e.g. Type 2 diabetes, heart disease) , cancers and musculoskeletal conditions?
5.	Do the genetic variants we find and their links to excess weight and its consequences differ between groups of people from different broad genetic ancestry groups ?","Project Purpose(s)

1.	Carefully curate the genetic and health related information that is linked to the AllofUS participants to ensure we are analysing only high quality data.2
2.	Select all AllofUS participants, and stratify them by their broad genetic ancestry.
3.	Use the latest genetic approaches to link genetic variation to weight related measures and characteristics. These characteristics will include height, weight, measures of weight change, electronic medical records of aspects of health related to weight – for example, weight loss after therapy, excess fat in the liver from medical images.
4.	Use the genetic information we have generated in steps 1-3 to understand the consequences of excess weight on health. We will use approaches such as “Mendelian randomisation”, a method that can help inform clinical trials. We will test genetic variants for their effects on many weight-related conditions, including cancer, Musculo-skeletal disease and metabolic diseases.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the following findings:
1.	New knowledge about the genetic variants that influence weight, including those involved in growth, excess weight and changes in weight.
2.	New knowledge about how genetic variants influence weight. For example, through the brain, fat, muscle, circulating factors, or other mechanisms.
3.	New knowledge about the role of excess weight and different types of excess weight in health and disease
4.	Improved understanding of differences in the effects of excess weight on health between people from different genetic backgrounds. This is important because we know that, for a given Body Mass Index, people of Asian and African genetic ancestry, for example, have a higher risk of obesity-related conditions compared to people of European genetic ancestry.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of several complications including peripheral neuropathy. In addition to hyperglycemia, multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of other metabolic syndrome risk factors, particularly obesity, increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Given the evidence liking obesity to peripheral neuropathy, interventions that target metabolic risk factors are likely needed to prevent or reverse neuropathy. However, the appropriate intensity and timing of these interventions to prevent peripheral neuropathy remain unknown. A better understanding of how metabolic risk factors, physical activity level, and other lifestyle factors are associated with, and predictive of neuropathy, would inform the future disease modifying therapies. We aim to determine and compare associations between metabolic risk factors, physical activity levels and other lifestyle factors of PN.","Project Purpose(s)

Our study will include all participants available in the dataset.
Our primary outcome will be neuropathy, irrespective of the glycemic status. Neuropathy will be identified using, SNOMED condition codes and a previously validated International ICD9 or ICD10 coding definitions.
Exposure variables such as Metabolic risk factor components, longitudinal physical activity measured using Fitbit devices will be assessed.
To account for confounding, we will also include demographics, other comorbidities and lifestyle factors
Our final analysis will include 2 process
Fitting a Cox Proportional Hazards model with a time varying physical activity data to determine the association between daily physical activity level and hazards of neuropathy diagnosis, after adjusting for confounding variables.
We will also use predictive algorithms to determine whether metabolic risk factors, physical activity levels, and other lifestyle factors can accurately predict peripheral neuropathy","Anticipated Findings
The study will determine whether metabolic risk factors and physical activity levels are associated with, and predictive of neuropathy in individuals. Furthermore, this study will determine if there exists  a daily physical activity threshold that is most predictive of neuropathy onset.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) face a disproportionate risk for chronic non-AIDS-related morbidities, including adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several studies have postulated cART toxicities as contributors to this health disparity. In this research project, we aim to investigate the effect of dolutegravir (DTG) on the risk of gestational diabetes.  Case reports have identified an association of DTG with hyperglycemia and new-onset type 2 diabetes in PLWH. This research project will improve our understanding of the metabolic effects of DTG during pregnancy. Specific questions we will ask are (1) Is there a difference in the incidence of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based vs non-DTG-based regimens?; (2) What are the effective predictors for barriers to prenatal care access related to oral glucose tolerance testing?","Project Purpose(s)

We will apply computational methods to (1) Retrieve the incidence rates of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based vs non-DTG-based regimens; (2) Assess the influence of the length of DTG-based treatment time on the level of glucose dysregulation; (3) Identify predictors for barriers to prenatal care access related to oral glucose tolerance testing within different clinical settings (e.g., rural, urban, safety-net hospital, etc.).","Anticipated Findings
For this research project, we expect to identify metabolic differences related to glucose regulation for HIV+ pregnant women on different cART regimens. We hypothesize that the DTG-associated risk for hyperglycemia and diabetes observed in PLWH will similarly impact HIV+ pregnant women.

We will further assess roles of SDOH in worsening severity between groups and evaluate long-term risk prediction for future CVD—all with the goal of providing detailed guidance for researchers and healthcare providers for CVD preventative care.
To these ends, we aim to answer the following questions:
-	Are there differences in MetS manifestation among marginalized groups?
-	If there are differences, how do severity scores derived within a group compare to those previously derived?
-	What are the relationships between MetS severity and SDOH?
-	Are there differences in CVD or T2D outcomes longitudinally by group?","Project Purpose(s)

Using the Controlled level v7 data to access EHR data from each participant, we will use confirmatory factor analysis of MetS components among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender sub-groups and assess how these differ from prior estimates, deriving group-specific MetS z-scores. Sub-groups will be assessed for differences in correlations between SDOH data and MetS severity. Finally, we will assess CVD and T2D, including new diagnosis and mortality relative to MetS z-scores at multiple time points.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that MetS manifests differently among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender subgroups, warranting derivation of separate MetS-Z scores to guide identification and treatment for MetS-related risk. We further hypothesize that a large portion of this risk is related to SDOH burden in minoritized groups. In all sub-groups, we expect that higher scores will predict new disease outcomes. Deriving MetS-Z scores for each sub-group would enable more specific clinical assessment of future disease risk by sub-group. Identification of relationships between MetS severity, SDOH, and CVD outcomes would highlight the medical harm of experienced discrimination and could help in risk stratification for groups not normally seen as having elevated CVD risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Defining Social Risk Phenotypes in Young Adults with Prediabetes or T2D,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is occurring at an increasing frequency in adolescents and young adults, resulting in severe complications such as kidney, eye, and nerve disease in early adulthood.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is occurring at an increasing frequency in adolescents and young adults, resulting in severe complications such as kidney, eye, and nerve disease in early adulthood. The proposed research will leverage the National Institutes of Health-supported All of Us Research Program, one of the most diverse health databases in history, to identify and define clustering's of social risk factors that are associated with higher risk of T2D, or its precursor “prediabetes,” in young adults. Although several individual social determinants of health (SDOH) are known to impact diabetes risk, the detailed SDOH that is prospectively collected by All of Us is an unparalleled tool that has not yet been leveraged to evaluate the combined and interactive effect of SDOH on diabetes risk in young adults. This work will serve as preliminary data to develop targeted interventions that address the SDOH that are most strongly associated with diabetes risk in young people.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Type 2 Diabetes)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The research team will use the NIH All of Us Research Program dataset to develop a retrospective cohort of individuals ages 18-34 years (young adults) without type 1 diabetes. Using this cohort, the team will pair physical measurement data and Fitbit data, electronic health record data, and survey-based measures of social determinants of health (SDOH) and lifestyle to characterize the association between interpersonal SDOH (e.g., social support, discrimination and disrespect), built environment and neighborhood safety, economic stability, and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in young adulthood. The team will perform Latent Class Analysis and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders to identify clusters of social risk factors that are associated with prediabetes or T2D prevalence or frequency of risk reducing behaviors.","Anticipated Findings
The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that a phenotype of interpersonal social determinants of health, including poor social bonds and greater experience of discrimination, will be present more often in young adults with prediabetes and T2D than in demographically similar peers without prediabetes or T2D. The team also hypothesizes that interpersonal relationships will be associated with engagement in risk-reducing behaviors. Knowledge of the most important social risk factors, which are potentially modifiable, could ultimately help to reduce risk of diabetes in young people by guiding intervention development. As social risk factors also contribute to outcomes for other health conditions beyond diabetes, this work could be leveraged to address other diseases impacting young adults, especially those most vulnerable.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Previous genetic studies have successfully identified >240 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many of the identified loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome, masking the underlying “effector gene”. Additionally, these studies were primarily performed in individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. As genetic findings are integrated into the clinic, this limited genetic understanding threatens to exacerbate existing health disparities among non-European communities disproportionately suffering from T2D and T2D-related health complications. Expanding our genetic understanding into non-European ancestries is essential as these studies will mitigate such health disparities and improve our ability to identify causal loci and mechanisms. In this study, I will leverage the diversity found within All of Us to perform a trans-ancestry genetic analysis of T2D, identifying likely causal variants and evaluating their potential for clinical utility.","Project Purpose(s)

Using well-established techniques in statistical genetics, I will (1) conduct a genome wide association study of common variants, as well as other forms of genetic variation (e.g., rare variants, copy number variations), to identify trans-ancestry and ancestry-specific disease-associated loci, (2) use statistical and functional fine-mapping techniques to identify the likely causal variants at disease-associated loci, validating my findings with experimental approaches, and (3) evaluate the clinical utility of my findings through polygenic scores (PGSs) and screening for potential targets of drug repurposing. For these analyses, I will use all participants with genetic data (whole genome and SNP-array). I will develop a phenotypic algorithm to classify participants into T2D cases and controls based on previously published work in electronic health records.","Anticipated Findings
Genetic studies of T2D have already provided valuable insight into disease pathophysiology. However, the vast majority of these studies have been performed in European and East Asian ancestries, threatening to exacerbate existing health disparities in populations carrying a disproportionate disease burden as genetics enters the clinic through preventative and therapeutic interventions. In the present study, I aim to address these shortcomings by leveraging the diversity found within All of Us to expand our genetic understanding of T2D. Based on the prior success of similar studies, I expect to identify many rare and common T2D-associated loci that are shared across ancestries as well as ancestry-specific. Combined with experimental and computational approaches, I will use these results to identify variants that are likely causal for T2D, propose the mechanism by which these variants contribute to T2D risk, and propose ways to translate my findings into clinical intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Metabolic diseases are a global epidemic. They occur when cells allocate too many of their primary resources towards one pathway, such as lipid production, at the expense of other crucial pathways, such as energy production. Understanding how cells control the pivotal point of allocating glucose towards lipid or energy production is key to developing effective treatments for these and other common metabolic diseases. PAS kinase (PASK) is a nutrient sensing protein kinase that regulates this critical metabolic node of lipid versus respiratory metabolism. PASK controls many of the hallmark pathways associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative disease yet little is known about PASK alleles associated with human disease. Herein we propose to conduct the first large-scale analysis to identify PASK alleles associated with human disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We target PASK as well as two of its substrates for our study.  Due to their regulation of the critical node of glucose partitioning to lipid versus respiratory metabolism, we propose to uncover the influence of PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on a variety of human phenotypes and classes of disease, from hyperlipidemia and diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders using the All of Us dataset.
In addition to the wide variety of phenotypic data that will aid in understanding the influence of variation in cellular respiration and triglyceride levels, the ancestral diversity represented by the individuals in the dataset will allow us to identify patterns and variants that differ or are similar across ancestry, defining effects common to humankind while opening further studies on multigene, secondary variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This knowledge is essential for developing targeted interventions that consider the interconnected nature of these socioeconomic factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
In our cross-sectional study targeting adults aged 18-65, we will employ a combination of surveys, medical records analysis, and interviews to investigate the relationship between income levels, diabetes, and obesity. Utilizing random sampling, we aim for a representative sample. Key independent variables include income, education, and occupation, while dependent variables encompass BMI and the presence of diabetes. Data will be analyzed using statistical methods, including inferential statistics and subgroup analysis.

The Purpose of my thesis is to untangle the impact of depression on adverse outcomes in the diabetic patient population. The particular adverse outcome I will be focusing on is diabetic foot ulceration in a national electronic health record (EHR) cohort of adult diabetic patients.  I will examine the effects of having diagnosed clinical depression, active depressive symptomology, and specific antidepressant medication treatment on the incidence of and time to foot ulceration. A better understanding of the role depression may play in the course of diabetes may help clinicians better manage the clinical care of diabetic patients.","Project Purpose(s)

The goal of this proposed research is to untangle the impact of depression on incident diabetic ulceration and time to diabetic ulceration. To achieve that goal I will be running multiple cohort studies using both traditional longitudinal analysis and survival analysis methods.","Anticipated Findings
Through longitudinal analysis, the messy relationship that depression has with the clinical course of diabetes, can be disentangled into an actionable set of clinical intervention points which physician can use to better care for their diabetic patients. Current research lacks a longitudinal survival analysis approach to this topic. I propose three longitudinal analyses to better understand the relationship between depression and the time to diabetic ulceration. Analyses will tackle the effects of Clinical Depression, Depressive Symptomology, and Antidepressant Treatment respectively. My results may serve as useful information for clinical practice and as a guild to future RCT research to improve outcomes in this population.

The primary scientific inquiry we aim to investigate revolves around ascertaining whether the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents yields additional cardiovascular benefits in comparison to the inhibition of either target in isolation, particularly in high-risk patients.
This research question holds significant importance as prevailing guidelines advocate for a more intensive management approach for type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. However, a substantial number of these patients struggle to attain the recommended treatment targets, even with maximal therapy. By examining the combined effects on blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation through the inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents , as demonstrated in this study, we intend to establish a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of a combined inhibitor approach.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes and CVD)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Dataset:
Utilize individual-level data from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD. Identify those at high risk who fail to achieve target blood glucose levels despite being on the maximum tolerated therapy for blood glucose reduction.
Methods:
Stratify participants based on genetic variants that are predictive of higher or lower levels. Subsequently, compare the rates of blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular events.
Analyses:
Utilize linear regression models to quantify the differences in blood glucose levels based on specific genotypes. Additionally, employ Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with different genotypes.
Test for interactions between genetic variants and the treatment effects of inhibitors on both blood glucose levels and clinical events.","Anticipated Findings
If genetic proxies confirm greater blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular benefit from blood glucose lowering variants, it would provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting combined pharmacological as a novel strategy for incremental risk reduction in high-risk patients, not at blood glucose goal. This would genetically validate the approach and inform the design of an outcomes trial directly comparing dual inhibition to individual inhibition alone","Demographic Categories of Interest

All prevalent human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s or diabetes, are known to be driven by a complex combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Numerous genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of genetic variants to common diseases. By design, GWAS
only find associations with a disease but cannot reveal which genetic variants are causal within
associated regions of the genome.  Current “fine mapping” algorithms, which aim to
pinpoint the truly causal variants, fail if there are too many variants that are inherited together, which is
often the case. This project will develop a new fine mapping method that uses GWAS data to identify
combinations of genetic variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The new method is based on a mathematical approximation that makes it much faster than existing
algorithms. This speed advantage allows the method to exhaustively explore the large number of
possible combinations of variants and identify those that have a high probability of being causal. In this
project, the new method will be thoroughly benchmarked against state-of-the art methods on simulated
data, for which the ground truth is known. The method will also be extended to consider additional
information about the human genome, such as the position of genes or molecular characteristics that
control the expression of genes.","Anticipated Findings
Many novel disease-associated genetic variants that have been overlooked to date are expected to be discovered by the
new approach. The final goal of the project is to implement the method in a user-friendly software

Drug use is controversial, especially when it involves illicit substances. Research shows that people who use drugs (PWUD) often face discrimination and stigma in healthcare settings, which results in them leaving against medical advice, or not returning despite needing critical medical attention.
I will be looking at the data from participants who identify as having a substance use disorder (SUD) and their experiences in healthcare settings. One question that will be looked at is: How often were you treated with respect by your doctors or health care provdiers?
Despite SUD being a medical diagnosis, I want to investigate how patients with this diagnosis are treated differently than those with other medical diagnoses such as diabetes or osteoarthritis.","Project Purpose(s)

These findings will help emphasize the stigma and bias that exists in medicine, so that we can encourage practitioners to unlearn the harmful and inaccurate narratives surrounding SUD, perpetuated by the racist war on drugs.

Cognitive impairment (CI) is a growing sequela of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Three newer glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) are used as second-line therapy for T2D, i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4). Some data suggest that these GLDs may have cognitive benefits, however, comparisons across drug classes are scarce. We intended to investigate the associations between newer GLD and CI among adults with T2D.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Adults with diagnosed or self-reported T2D will be identified from the dataset. We used medication codes to identify the person’s GLD use. We will study three groups: (1) adults filling Metformin plus DPP4, (2) adults filling Metformin plus SGLT2i, and (3) adults filling Metformin plus GLP-1RA. CI was measured using ICD code or survey from EHR. The three groups were matched with a 1:1 multigroup propensity score algorithm based on age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities (e.g., obesity, and cardiovascular disease). Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to compare the associations between newer GLD use and CI, further adjusting for residual unbalanced covariates after matching.","Anticipated Findings
There are three categories of glucose-lowering drugs, which include GLP1-RA, DPP4, and SGLT2i. The study may show that one of these categories is associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment compared to the other two categories. For patients with type 2 diabetes who have experienced a decline in cognitive function, clinicians may consider prescribing drugs from this particular category to help slow down the rate of cognitive decline.","Demographic Categories of Interest

HbA1c is a clinical measure used to assess glycemic control over time. However some genetic variants may interfere with the accuracy of HbA1c as a measure of glycemic control. This could have negative implications for management of patients with diabetes/prediabetes and lead to an increased risk of complications. This is particularly an issue for individuals with ancestry from malaria endemic regions, whose genomes may contain high impact variants in genes such as G6PD and HBB (i.e. sickle cell trait) that have been under selective pressure from malaria in the past and may now be interfering with accurate clinical use of the HbA1c measure.

The purpose of this research project is to test for any relationship between genetic predisposition for diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and and heart disease and risk for PASC. If any associations are identified, we will try to identify immune system characteristics that may link the genetic predisposition with risk for PASC.

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians.

With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging.

Pernicious anemia (PA), the end-stage of autoimmune gastritis, impairs the ability to absorb vitamin B12 from a non-vegetarian diet. Many patients diagnosed with PA suffer from delays in diagnosis, inadequate testing, and lack of understanding of disease etiology. Often PA patients have other autoimmune diseases like autoimmune thyroid and type 1 diabetes. Understanding the link between PA and other autoimmune diseases can help with understanding the heritability of these diseases. A previous genetic study found 5 genetic variants for PA, but replication is needed with the addition of other populations to understand how genetic diversity contributes to PA etiology. With a larger sample size, and more diverse sample, we will be able to find more genetic causal variants that contribute to pernicious anemia and if there is variation of etiology in different ancestral populations. Comparing the genetics of multiple autoimmune diseases can help find genetic variants that are specific to PA.","Project Purpose(s)

This workbench aims to validate the study of Abegaz et al. (https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/8/1138) and to uncover fairness in the way in which the model predicts on certain patients. This entails measuring the difference in AUC and statistical parity between different genders and ethnicies.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)

The first part of the study will be on constructing a classification model to automatically predict if a person has diabetes. There exist many such models for this like random forrest models, gradient boosted trees, artificial neural networks and simple logistic regression. The notebook will examine ways to mitigate the effects of being underrepresented in the dataset using method like Random Over Sampling and Interpolated Over Sampling (like SMOTE).","Anticipated Findings
The study expects to find classification models to predict most correctly on well represented groups within the All of Us Dataset. If there is a significant disparity of model fairness between genders or ethnicities  then this would call for more validation studies of other papers which do not examine fairness on protected features.
Decision trees, convolutional neural networks, and encoder decoder networks can be used to find latent feature representations of the highly dimensional datasets. These methods are useful in finding important features used in the prediction process, and can be used to see the importance of sensitive variables like race and gender in classification. We can also stratify the dataset by race and gender and see if certain features are important for some groups but not for others.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), but the metabolic benefits of PA vary across individuals. While many factors could modify the PA-T2D association, this project seeks to understand the role that genetics plays, by studying gene by PA interactions on the risk of T2D.  Specifically, the project will address two questions:
Question 1: Is there evidence for gene by PA interaction on T2D risk?
Question 2: If gene by PA interaction on T2D risk  exists, what is the biology driving this interaction?
These two questions are important and relevant. While knowing genetic factors that set people apart enables precision health, understanding the biology driving the separation lays the ground work for design interactions that harness the full metabolic benefits of PA.","Project Purpose(s)

Aim 1: We will study the data from participants with Type 2 diabetes and compare it to data from participants without type 2 diabetes from All of Us.

We will investigate factors that contribute to diabetes at the population level, such as the built environment, including neighborhood walkability, parks and recreation, access to food, obesity, meal preparation, access to transportation, race and ethnicity, age, zip code, and access to health care. Descriptive statistics will be calculated. Multivariable analysis, risk ratio, and regression models will be applied to assess the risk associations.
Aim 2: We will use the subset of data from All of Us participants with or without Type 2 Diabetes with available whole genome sequences to identify nutrient-sensing mTOR variants in both males and females across all ethnicities. First, we will identify population-level genetic variations in mTOR proteins.","Anticipated Findings
Aim 1: Findings from these studies will identify the food access, built environment, and access social, demographic, and environmental factors that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus provide rational and justifications for public health policy changes for harm reduction from the build environment exposure on the development of type 2 diabetes.
Aim 2: We expect to verify whether there are mTOR-specific variants that could be used as predictive of type 2 diabetes or hold the promise of mapping out a favorable response to treatment. The findings might help identify mTOR variants that are either protective or elevated risk for the development of diabetes.
Collectively, data from this work will provide an understanding of the contributors of the exposome that lead to the development of type 2 diabetes and increased cardiometabolic risk, which could be utilized clinically to map out personalized precision-medicine plans.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It has been estimated that 10.2% of the global population will have diabetes by 2030.  PRS combined with non-genetic predictors potentially holds utility for identifying individuals at high risk prior to disease onset, motivating positive health behavior change or repeated screening for those at high risk, or even guiding therapeutic interventions. The All of Us Research Program is uniquely situated to address these questions and identify opportunities for tailoring prediction across multi-ancestry populations.
Our primary study question is to investigate whether a multi-ancestry T2D PRS will be associated with T2D-related phenotypic risk factors and complications across diverse populations. In particular, we hypothesize that the T2D PRS may help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. Our secondary study question will investigate whether the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D risk is mediated by T2D risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)

We will construct a multi-ancestry T2D PRS based on a large multi-ancestry T2D GWAS meta-analysis. We will also construct a PRS based on a recent T2D GWAS meta-analysis that includes a larger number of non-European ancestry individuals. In addition, we will evaluate a genome-wide PRS using recent approaches such as LDPred2, PRS-CSx, and others.
For our primary study question, in analyses stratified by T2D status, we will evaluate the association between the T2D PRS and the T2D-related risk factors and complications using regression models. For our secondary study question, we will evaluate whether the T2D risk factors mediate the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D status. This will be performed using regression models to assess the relationship between 1) the PRS and T2D risk, 2) the PRS and the T2D risk factor, 3) the T2D risk factor and T2D risk, and 4) the PRS and T2D risk while adjusting for the T2D risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that our T2D PRS may hold prognostic value and help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. We anticipate that the effectiveness of T2D PRS is context-dependent. The T2D PRS may perform well in predicting T2D risk for diverse populations and may hold potential prognostic value for prediabetes and T2D controls.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How do longitudinal activity measures, as captured by wearable technology like Fitbit, influence the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with diabetes?
Physical activity is a known modifiable risk factor in the management of diabetes. However, its specific impact on the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy is less clear. Given the global prevalence of diabetes and its complications, understanding how lifestyle factors like physical activity influence the risk of diabetic retinopathy is crucial for developing targeted prevention strategies.
This study could advance our understanding of how to effectively utilize such technology in chronic disease management and prevention. If a significant association is found, it could lead to more personalized health recommendations for individuals with diabetes, potentially integrating wearable technology into routine care to monitor and encourage physical activity.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
All of Us Research Program: Utilize the program’s comprehensive dataset, focusing on individuals with diabetes. The dataset will provide:
Physical Activity Data: Extracted from Fitbit devices, including daily step counts, exercise intensity, and duration.
Diabetic Retinopathy Data: Sourced from electronic health records, detailing the onset, progression, and severity of diabetic retinopathy.
Covariates: Demographic information, diabetes-related metrics (e.g., duration of diabetes, glycemic control), and other health factors.
Retrospective Cohort Study Design: Analyze existing longitudinal data to assess the relationship between physical activity and the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.
Descriptive Statistics: To summarize participant characteristics and activity patterns.
Regression Analysis: Employ logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between activity levels and diabetic retinopathy risk, adjusting for potential confounders","Anticipated Findings
Physical Activity's Impact: Expect to identify specific activity patterns that correlate with reduced diabetic retinopathy risk in diabetics.
Risk Quantification: Aim to quantify how much physical activity mitigates this risk, potentially finding beneficial activity thresholds.
Subgroup Variations: The study may reveal differences in activity-retinopathy associations across demographics and diabetes types.
Prevention Insights: Findings could enhance understanding of lifestyle factors in diabetic retinopathy prevention
Public Health: Results could inform public health recommendations, emphasizing physical activity in diabetes care.
Wearable Tech: Using Fitbit data demonstrates wearable technology's potential in chronic disease management.
Clinical Practice Guidance: Findings might help healthcare providers advise diabetic patients on physical activity for eye health.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects over 2 billion individuals worldwide and is associated with a number of health and social complications. There are currently three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of AUD, however the effectiveness of these medications are modest at best.
Emerging evidence suggests that the glucagon like peptide 1 agonists (GLP-1As) may be effective in reducing alcohol use. GLP-1As are currently approved for treatment of diabetes mellitus and obesity.  We aim to review the data of patients with diabetes mellitus and/or obesity who are taking GLP-1A versus those not taking GLP-1A, to compare their alcohol use. We will check the odds ratio/prevalence of alcohol use disorder among patients with or without GLP-1A. Other comparisons will include liver enzyme levels, prevalence of hepatic steatosis, and other comorbid conditions among those taking GLP-1A versus those not taking GLP-1A.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (alcohol abuse)","Scientific Approaches
a cross-sectional study to compare patients with diabetes mellitus and/or obesity who are on GLP-1A vs not receiving medication, assessing differences in alcohol consumption and the prevalence of alcohol-related liver disease.
Inclusion criteria: Adult patients aged 18 to 70 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] greater than 30 kg/m2 in non-Asians, and BMI greater than 25kg/m2 in Asians.
Analysis steps : Participants will be sub-stratified into GLP1(+) versus GLP1(-).
The presence of alcohol use disorder will be collected from medical records. The degree of alcohol consumption will be assessed.
Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, BMI, comorbidity, laboratory data including liver enzymes, kidney tests, will be collected from medical records.  Alcohol use disorder will be classified according to the CDC classification system, Differences between groups will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that patients receiving GLP-1A treatment will exhibit a lower prevalence of alcohol use disorder and alcohol related liver disease compared to those not receiving GLP-1A.
If the data support our hypothesis, this finding would further support emerging evidence suggesting the GLP-1As have a role in reducing alcohol intake and potentially decreasing alcohol use disorder.
It is important to note that these anticipated findings are based on emerging evidence, and the actual results may differ. The study's outcomes will provide valuable scientific insights into the relationship between GLP-1A treatment, alcohol use disorder, alcohol-associated liver disease, and can potentially guide future research and clinical practice in this field.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hidradentis suppurativa (HS) is a highly heritable dermatological disease characterized by recurrent, painful nodules and abscesses. It is known to disproportionately affect patients of color. To date, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been published on HS. Our group, the HS Program for Research and Care Excellence (HS ProCARE), has already performed GWAS on HS patients who are in HS ProCARE. We aim to meta-analyze our results HS results from biobanks that have identified HS cases. We expect the results will increase understanding of genetic contributors to HS and improve understanding of the underlying causes of HS and the basis for known comorbidities such as inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

I intend to study the validity of population stratification by race using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis, and its potential to identify more genetically valid variables to stratify populations on. I will be exploring the genetic diversity of populations with T2DM and examining how individuals of similar ethnic backgrounds cluster in principal component space.
This research is important because population stratification is a common practice in genetic research and can be used to identify genetic risk factors for diseases. However, there is a growing concern about the potential for this practice to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to health disparities. By examining the genetic diversity of populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, I hope to identify more genetically valid variables to stratify populations on and provide insight into how we can use genetics to inform public health interventions in a responsible and equitable way.","Project Purpose(s)

Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)","Scientific Approaches
I plan to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze genetic data from the All of Us dataset, specifically focusing on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. I will initially perform PCA on individual SNPs of interest and potentially on whole genome sequences to obtain larger degrees of scatter. Once I have visualized the variability in principal component space, I will perform clustering analysis on the points to identify commonalities between individuals within clusters. I will also compare the results of population stratification by race to stratification by other potential variables. I will use statistical software such as R or Python to perform these analyses. The research methods will adhere to ethical guidelines and ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants. The tools used will include PCA, clustering analysis, in Google Colaboratory for Python.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study are that the use of principal component analysis to stratify populations by race may not be statistically valid for certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. This could potentially lead to a more accurate and effective method of population stratification, potentially based on other genetic variables that are more relevant to the disease in question.
If successful, these findings could contribute to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of population genetics, as well as personalized medicine. The ability to more accurately stratify populations by genetic factors that are relevant to specific diseases could lead to more effective preventative and treatment strategies, ultimately improving public health outcomes. Ultimately we hope to recommend a novel population stratification method to allow for higher predictability of disease outcomes in population strata.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Do providers prescribe statins for hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 DM less often in patients with NASH than those without NASH?
PCP's are reluctant to prescribe statins to patient's with abnormal liver function tests because of the known risk of hepatotoxicity associated with statin use. However, statins have not only been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and type 2 Diabetes, but have also been proven to have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic properties and may thus inhibit progression from simple steatosis to fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
The goal of this study is to look at a diverse panel of patients to evaluate the prescribing patterns for statins in patients both with and without NASH and hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

We will also explore potential racial, ethnic, education, income, and geographic location differences CV health within SGM individuals. This project is led by Dr. Billy Caceres who is a CV nurse scientist and a nationally recognized expert on the CV health of SGM individuals. There is growing evidence showing that SGM adults are at greater risk for CV disease than non-SGM individuals. However, potential reasons for these differences are not understood.

GLP-1 RA Association with DR and DME,"Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity.

Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity. Despite the increasing use of GLP-1 RA, their impact on diabetic retinopathy remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence on the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most of this evidence stems from the multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs, which have defined DR differently. Most of the other studies have not been large enough to adequately answer this question. This study aims to investigate the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and DR and diabetic macular edema progression via the All of Us research database. We will also determine whether lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse access to GLP-1 RA and thus worse DR.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
To determine if there is an association between use of GLP-1 RAs and progression/presence of diabetic retinopathy (none/NPDR/PDR) or diabetic macular edema that required treatment in the form of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or corticosteroid (i.e., triamcinolone) injection, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Two cohorts: One on GLP-1 RA therapy and the other not on GLP-1 RA therapy. Only patients with type 2 DM. Patients should not have PDR prior to initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy. Patients should be treatment-naive (no prior intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy).
Covariates: Age at diagnosis of DM, sex, birth country, race/ethnicity, education level, insurance status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, smoking history, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI).
Multivariate logistic regression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that GLP-1 RA therapy is not associated with progression or presence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema that requires treatment in the form of intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy. As the literature currently has conflicting evidence on this question, we hope this study will provide further guidance on this matter. Additionally, we hope that this study will encourage primary care physicians and endocrinologists to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus aggressively to minimize all the associated systemic complications of diabetes mellitus including worsening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema from worsening control of blood glycemic levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Datasets: Fitbit accelerometry data; data regarding diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, blood glucose metrics, cholesterol metrics, and blood pressure.

Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will explore machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are at substantially increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.  A reliable predictive model could be very helpful for identifying individuals at the greatest risk so that they can modify lifestyle and health habits and their physicians can consider pharmacologic interventions and closer monitoring.
We are particularly interested in determining whether the model is as effective for historically underrepresented groups as it is for historically well represented groups.  Historically, medical studies examining prognostic predictors, including for cardiac health have focused on predominantly Caucasian populations and might not be as applicable to underrepresented minorities.

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.

Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The genetic risk score estimates we are using were developed primarily based on a population of subjects of European ancestry and it is uncertain whether these risk estimates translate to people of non-European ancestry, which is one of the questions we will attempt to answer.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I will stratify diabetes type genetic risk score (GRS) by ancestry to determine if the distribution of GRS has significant variation by ancestry group. For populations where GRS is significantly different from those with European ancestry, I will estimate population specific risk scales and test if these risk estimates are similar in our pediatric study cohort when stratified by ancestry. For statistical methods, I will derive genetic ancestry using pre-trained machine learning based classification models based on principal components analysis and will analyze the correlation (R2) between genetic and self-reported ancestry. I will use parametric t-testing to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean between each ancestry group with European ancestry individuals. Bonferroni correction will be applied to adjust alpha threshold for multiple testing. Percentiles of GRS derived from All of Us will be translated to absolute risk calculations as a product of prevalence.","Anticipated Findings
Our findings would be particularly notable if the genetic risk score estimates are not valid in subjects of non-European ancestry as it would imply that polygenic risk scores do not simply translate across different genetic ancestry thus requiring modification or otherwise development of new risk estimates specific to subjects non-European ancestry. Alternatively, it would also be significant to find that the genetic risk estimates are able to be validated in populations of non-European ancestry as it would potentially remove a barrier to bring polygenic risk scores to the patient bedside to aid in diagnosis or identify high risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

""I aim to investigate the correlation between genetic markers and the onset of Type 2 diabetes, particularly in diverse populations. This research is vital because it may uncover specific genetic predispositions that contribute to the disease's higher prevalence in certain ethnic groups. Understanding these relationships could lead to more targeted public health interventions and personalized treatment strategies, helping to reduce the disease's incidence and improve the quality of care for those affected.

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
My study will employ a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to identify genetic variations linked to Type 2 diabetes. I plan to utilize the AoU genomic dataset alongside self-reported health information. Data analysis will be conducted using statistical software such as R and Python for data cleaning, processing, and analysis. Specifically, I will use Python's pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation, and R's Bioconductor for in-depth genetic analysis. Machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and logistic regression, will be applied to predict disease risk based on genetic markers. Furthermore, I will leverage visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python for data representation. The robustness of the AoU dataset allows for cross-referencing genetic data with lifestyle factors, providing a comprehensive analysis of potential genotype-phenotype correlations.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate identifying novel genetic markers associated with Type 2 diabetes, particularly in underrepresented populations. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of genetic susceptibility to the disease, potentially uncovering new targets for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, this research could lead to the development of predictive models for disease risk based on genetic profiles, informing personalized medicine approaches. The study's results will add to the existing scientific literature by providing insights into the interplay between genetics and lifestyle factors in the onset of Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, by focusing on diverse populations, the study aims to address current gaps in genetic research, contributing to more equitable healthcare outcomes.

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease. Thus, the purpose of this workspace is  to develop internal methods for examining the association between polygenic risk scores of unique intermediate phenotypes derived in diverse  population based cohorts, and overt cardiometabolic disease within All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)

We will leverage whole genome sequencing data from multiple, diverse, population based cohorts to derive polygenic risk scores for a variety of novel phenotypes using multiple methods such as: clumping/pruning and thresholding (PRSice), LDpred2, and PRS-CS. Validated scores will then be constructed for each All of Us participant and the association between polygenic risk and cardiometabolic diseases will be examined.","Anticipated Findings
The current workbench serves as a first step toward identifying novel pathways linking intermediate phenotypes available in our diverse population based cohorts to cardiometabolic disease risk in All of Us. Furthermore, there is considerable interest in developing and validating polygenic risk scores in diverse populations to shrink gaps in clinical care across ethnic and socioeconomic groups.

Arab-Americans experience similar barriers in healthcare access as other ethnic minorities in the US, and tend to have worse health outcomes than caucasian patients. Moreover, Arab-Americans tend to experience a higher burden of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, unlike other minorities, Arab-Americans are classified as ""White"" on US census data as well as in most nationally representative health databases.
Given the unique challenges faced by Arab-Americans, this misguided data aggregation represents a costly missed opportunity to elucidate insights about the health status of Arab-Americans.
We intend to study the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases amongst Middle Eastern and North African identifying individuals, and contrast that with non-hispanic caucasian individuals, in order to elucidate differences in health status and ultimately demonstrate the importance of deaggregating MENA demographics data within healthcare system and databases.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
we will use epidemiological tools to assess whether there is a meaningful difference between MENA-Americans and non-hispanic white individuals in terms of baseline health status, burden of disease, access to healthcare, and health outcomes.
We will perform a retrospective cohort study, and run appropriate statistical analyses while controlling for potential confounding variables.","Anticipated Findings
We except to find a higher burden of disease amongst MENA-identifying individuals compare to non-hispanic white individuals, worse access to healthcare, and worse health outcomes. There is plenty of evidence within the MENA community about these disparities, yet the lack of a ""MENA"" demographic category has prevented these disparities from being validated through large, nationally representative databases. The ""All of Us"" database provides a unique opportunity for the MENA-identifying community to validate the challenges and struggles they have experienced for decades. This visibility and proper representation will be impactful in advocating healthcare systems and large public health databases to include a MENA demographic category, and will help the MENA-identifying community to advocate for and receive federal and local funding as well as appropriate public health interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes is challenging to manage and requires lifelong self-regulation behaviors to prevent debilitating complications. Perceived discrimination could directly heighten stress response and impact individuals’ mental and physical health outcomes. However, previous studies show inconsistency in the influences of anxiety on diabetes outcomes. Social support has been linked to patients’ mortality rate and reported as deemed positive or buffering when it was related to a reduced impact of perceived discrimination on negative health. Thus, our research questions are: 1 Does perceived discrimination impact diabetes subjective and clinical outcomes? 2 What is the role of anxiety between perceived discrimination and diabetes outcomes? 3 Does social support moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and diabetes outcomes?4 Does social support moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and anxiety and further influence the effects of anxiety on diabetes outcomes?","Project Purpose(s)

For RQ1.3. A moderation analysis will be conducted to examine if social support moderates the effect of discrimination on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.4.  Moderation analyses will be conducted to examine if social support moderates the effect of discrimination on anxiety and the effect of anxiety on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.

This study aims to examine the direct effects of perceived discrimination in medical settings on the diabetes care outcomes, and the indirect effects of perceived discrimination in medical settings on the diabetes care outcomes through anxiety after controlling for demographics and individuals’ physical conditions. Social support has been previously reported as a significant factor associated with self-management outcomes among people with chronic health conditions. We hypothesize that social support will moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and diabetes care outcomes, and social support will also moderate the effect of discrimination on anxiety and further decreases the effects of anxiety on health outcomes. We expect the results from this study to provide meaningful information to healthcare professionals regarding the impact of discrimination in medical care settings on patients’ health, and if social support could moderate the effects of said discrimination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will be developing predictive models based on classical statistical methods as well as advanced machine learning algorithms. We will build ""cohorts"" based on individuals who are free of specific diseases of interest at the time to entry to All of Us.  We will then link information on ""baseline"" variables for these individuals to prospectively collected data on disease outcomes (e.g those captured through electronic medical records).   Disease-specific models will incorporate available information on corresponding  well established risk factors such as age, family history, smoking, BMI and alcohol consumption. In addition, when genetic data becomes available, the model will incorporate information on emerging polygenic risk scores from genome-wide association studies. Finally,  we will explore potential role of high-dimensional biomarkers, such as blood metabolites, on risk prediction beyond risk factors that are easy to ascertain and evaluated in more parsimonious models.","Anticipated Findings
Our study will lead to comprehensive multi-ethnic models for risk prediction models across a number of common chronic diseases. Using results from the study, we will further develop online risk calculators for potential clinical applications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Lupus is an autoimmune disease when the body's immune system attacks its tissues and organs, causing widespread inflammation - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus became a global pandemic, and while there were many named co-morbidities- such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer, however, there was very little information about the association of COVID-19 and Lupus. Vaccines are well-studied medications to reduce and have even eliminated many diseases in the national population. As Lupus is an autoimmune disease, most medical professionals encourage their patients to get at least one of the available vaccines. Still, many African Americans, even those without Lupus, hesitated to get a vaccine. This study looks at the impact of Covid-19 infections on those diagnosed with Lupus and attitudes surrounding available vaccines.","Project Purpose(s)

Scientific Question: How do patterns of physical activity and dietary habits influence the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in urban areas? Why are some urban areas more affected than others, even with similar socio-economic backgrounds?
Importance: Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern, especially in urban areas. Understanding the relationship between lifestyle habits, such as physical activity and diet, and the prevalence of this disease is crucial. By identifying key factors in specific urban regions, we can design better public health interventions and policies. This will not only help in managing the disease but also in preventing its onset in at-risk populations. The significance of this research transcends the realm of science and directly impacts community health, potential healthcare costs, and overall quality of life.","Project Purpose(s)

1. Data Collection:
Datasets: We will utilize the AoU data, which offers comprehensive information on individual health records, including details on physical activity, dietary habits, and diabetes status. It's crucial to ensure that the dataset includes demographic details like age, gender, socio-economic status, and geographical location, as these can act as confounding variables.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Previous studies have been able to map variations in medication administration and treatment decisions in conditions like Type 2 Diabetes and substance abuse disorder. Similar to contraception, there are many options for the treatment of high blood sugar and substance use and may be a complex decision-making process between personal and provider preferences. No currently published work has mapped the contraception decisions of an individual over time. Our goal is to quantify the variation in contraception prescriptions for individuals in the All of Us Research Program dataset.
The overall objective of this project is to understand contraception prescription patterns in individuals who identify as female within the All of Us dataset.

A retrospective, longitudinal analysis will be conducted using the All of Us Research Program dataset to identify contraceptive prescribing patterns for individuals who identify as female in the United States. First, we will use the Cohort Builder within the workbench to identify all eligible adult participants (≥18 years of age) who identify as female. We will then limit the cohort to just individuals who have a medication record of at least one contraceptive including, birth control pills (e.g., Microgestin), IUDs (e.g., Levonorgestrel [Mirena]), implants (e.g., Etonogestrel [Nexplanon]), and injections (e.g., Depo-Provera). We will use Python within the All of Us Researcher Workbench to complete the study objectives.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that we will be able to complete the study objectives within the timeframe of the summer. Overall, the anticipated results of the project will have a significant positive impact on the field of contraception research and ultimately improve the quality of care for individuals seeking contraception. In the long term, we expect to develop predictive models that can help healthcare providers identify the most effective contraceptive methods for individual patients based on their characteristics and preferences. More excitingly, we are looking forward to the project that will conduct and provide some educational resources which help individuals and healthcare providers make decisions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

There are 37.3 million people living with diabetes in the United States. The prevalence of diabetes among non-Hispanic Blacks is 11.7% compared to 7.5% among non-Hispanic Whites.  Non-Hispanic Blacks are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and twice as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to die from diabetes. While socioeconomic status does play a role in the prevalence of diabetes, it's important to note that the relationship between income and diabetes prevalence is complex and influenced by many factors. Research has shown that diabetes prevalence is generally higher among individuals with lower income.  However, little is known about the impact and prevalence of type 2 diabetes among middle-class non- Hispanic Blacks.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Type 2 Diabetes)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to create two cohorts of subjects (non- Hispanic Blacks and other [white, Hispanic, etc.)  representing middle class based on income, education, employment, insurance, and zip code.
We will use descriptive statistics (to describe the sample), as well as t-test (for comparisons between the two groups) and linear regression to assess the impact of covariates on glycemic outcomes (A1c & blood glucose).","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that there will be a difference between the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among middle-class, non- Hispanic Blacks compared to non- Hispanic Whites.  We further hypothesize that there will be a difference in glycemic outcomes between the 2 groups.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 1000 genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, and these results have started to be used for applications with potential clinical use, such as polygenic risk scores (PRS) intended to predict the development of the disease. However, Latino ancestry has been historically underrepresented, as most GWAS have been developed within European ancestries. Besides delaying the discovery of the genetic regions associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in Latino populations, it has also compromised the performance of  PRS and exaggerated health disparities across ancestries. Scientific aim: Improve and validate methods to improve PRS prediction in Latino populations by leveraging summary statistics for multiple ancestry groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We will integrate GWAS data from large-scale genetic studies from Latino and other multiple ancestries to construct PRS for type 2 diabetes prediction and leverage the ALL of Us data to validate the performance of the PRSs for diverse ancestries. We will use ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PRSs using the PRS-CS and PRS-CSx methods, respectively.","Anticipated Findings
Given the richness of diversity and data availability in the All of Us data, we anticipate it to be an ideal cohort to test the performance of the PRSs. This will allow us to develop an improved PRS appropriate for the continuum of diversity of Latino populations. This will help address health disparities and allow us to understand better the altered mechanistic pathways of type 2 diabetes in individuals with high genetic risk for the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In this study, we aim to explore the genetic variants and other environmental and lifestyle risk factors that are associated with diabetic neuropathy.
Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a nerve damage that occurs in diabetic patients. This is due to the inability of the body to produce insulin, which metabolizes glucose in the body, and excess glucose in the blood leads to nerve damage and other complications. Prior studies have shown the relationship between DN and higher hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, age, longer duration of type 1 diabetes, male sex, greater height, higher weight, low physical activity, higher pulse rate, family history of type 2 diabetes, lower HDL cholesterol, higher total cholesterol, medication use, obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, etc.
The incidence of DN needs to be controlled to the barest minimum, as there is presently no cure for the disease; hence, the urgent need to investigate the risk factors known to be associated with it.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetic neuropathy)","Scientific Approaches
The All of Us research study has a total population of about 605,000 participants aged 18 and above, who are resident in various parts of the United States. This includes data from about 340 sites across the United States and can be termed diverse due to the inclusion of more than 50% of racial and ethnic minorities, and about 80% of groups underrepresented in biomedical research.
An exploratory data analysis including histogram plots showing the proportion of people with DN aggregated by age, gender, and race/ethnicity will be carried out. It is equally important to understand how levels of physical activity change in relation to diabetic neuropathy, and this relationship will be visualized using bar plots. Furthermore, we will investigate the genomic data by DN status.
Using R statistical software, a logistic regression model will be used to explore these relationships.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to find a correlation between diabetic neuropathy and existing risk factors, such as higher hemoglobin levels, age, duration of diabetes, male sex, hypertension, BMI, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, and low physical activity.
Since there has been no existent cure for diabetic neuropathy, our findings will form a basis to further solidify the evidence of association between the existing risk factors and DN and may identify more lifestyle and environmental factors responsible for this condition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Wearable devices such as Fitbit and Apple Watch have been available for many years, tracking information such as steps, activity, heart rate, and sleep.  While as patients and consumers we find this information useful in managing our general fitness, the data captured by these devices may have associations with important medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  In some cases, wearable device data can be uploaded to our personal physicians through patient portals such as MyChart, however it remains unclear how this information can and should be utilized by medical providers.  In this study, we hope to explore the associations between wearable device metrics, including steps, heart rate, activity, and sleep, with medical outcomes such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity.  Associations between wearable device data and diagnoses of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease will also be explored.","Project Purpose(s)

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 10% of the world's population will have diabetes by 2035. Patients living with diabetes are at higher risk for many acute and chronic complications, which may lead to increased hospital or ED visits. Accurate subtyping of those with type 2 diabetes is crucial to understand what characteristics of patients lead to increased risk of adverse outcomes, and is key to more effective and targeted treatments of diabetes and its complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will make use of a machine learning method called Deep Metric Learning (DML). DML seeks to learn a representation of the patient's state by maximizing its similarity with other patients with the same label. DML has previously been shown to be effective in subtyping several diseases in the medical imaging domain. However, DML has not been widely used on Electronic Health Records (EHR) and genetic data. Here, we propose using DML to learn subtypes for type 2 diabetes using time-series data from the EHR, as well as survey and genetic data.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that the DML representations we learn will form natural clusters corresponding to patient subtypes. We anticipate that patients in particular subtypes will exhibit similarities based on their input features (i.e. demographics, labs, vitals, surveys, or genetics). Patients in different subtypes may also have different outcomes (i.e. # hospital visits, complications, mortality). We believe that characterizing such subtypes will be useful for clinicians to provide targeted treatments to different patients, which may improve health outcomes. Characterizing such subtypes may also be useful in more accurate diagnosis of diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The escalating burden of severe obesity in women of reproductive age has driven a growing utilization of weight loss surgery (WLS) in this population. Despite benefits such as reduced incidence of gestational diabetes, a pregnancy after WLS is considered high-risk given the elevated rate of various adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, there have been serious concerns about the negative impact of WLS on maternal mental health, particularly related to depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality. These mental disorders increase the risk for severe maternal morbidity by 50% and are the leading cause of maternal mortality.
We propose to use All of Us data to accomplish two specific aims. Aim 1 Determine the individual and composite prevalence of depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality in pregnant women post-WLS. Aim 2 Examine the association of composite mental disorders with severe maternal morbidity post-WLS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
For Aim 1, we will use t-test to compare the prevalence of mental disorders between pregnant women post-WLS and comparison groups. For Aim 2, we will apply logistic regression to examine the association between mental disorders and severe maternal morbidity, adjusting for factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and pregnancy complications.","Anticipated Findings
This study is of clinical significance because the findings will aid clinicians in offering more informed counseling regarding the risk-benefit profiles of preconception WLS. Also, this study carries policy relevance. Current policies aiming to enhance perinatal mental health care mainly target traditional high-risk groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status. This study will raise awareness about the mental health burden faced by women conceiving post-WLS, supporting future advocacy for the inclusion of their needs into policy formulation. Moreover, while national guidelines for post-WLS pregnancy management have been published, mental health was a missing piece. This study can, therefore, foster efforts to develop more inclusive guidelines that incorporate mental health aspects, to optimize maternal care post-WLS.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It is currently known that young adults of black and Hispanic descent tend to have poorer health outcomes than their white counterparts in managing a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, involving higher HbA1c levels over time, less use of diabetes technology, and poorer self-reported measures of management at home. Additionally, individuals of black and Hispanic descent are at an increased risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the onset of diagnosis, which is associated with lower glycemic control over time and poorer health outcomes. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that sufficient genetic screenings be implemented so that type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed asymptomatically. The question that arises is whether or not these screenings are readily accessible to individuals who are at an increased risk. Given that early diagnoses are associated with better health outcomes, this study aims to explore the association between race, age of diagnosis, and health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Juvenile Diabetes)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The first dataset will be individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes as confirmed by mention in the medical records. I will exclude individuals who presented with DKA, as DKA is associated with a lower age of diagnosis upon onset and may present a confound. I seek to explore confirmed diagnoses before the onset of life-threatening illnesses, such as DKA.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that individuals of black and  Hispanic descent will be diagnosed with T1D at an older age due to various factors such as generalized mistrust within the healthcare system and less access to reliable healthcare. This will further indicate who is currently most at risk and will allow for public health efforts to create targeted initiatives to increase the accessibility of screenings in those communities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Liver disease was the #10 cause of death in the United States in 2022. Risk factors for advanced liver disease include viral hepatitis infection, excess alcohol use, and components of the metabolic syndrome including diabetes. However,  we have only limited ability to predict who is at highest risk of developing advanced liver disease and, therefore, how to prevent advanced disease. We aim to identify predictive models for advanced liver disease incorporating genetics, demographics, behaviors, lived environment, medical comorbidities, laboratory values, and other predictors. We are also interested in looking at population attributable fraction for different risk factors (metabolic comorbidities, genetics, lived environment, and behaviors including alcohol intake and substance use) across different populations including race and geography.","Project Purpose(s)

We will conduct time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to validate known risk factors for advanced liver disease, including excess alcohol intake, diabetes, and known genetic risk factors. We hope to identify novel predictors of advanced liver disease (environmental, behavior, genetic, etc) and interactions between different risk factors (e.g., between genetic risk and certain behaviors). We also hope to identify accurate, easily-usable models to predict which people are most likely to develop liver disease.

Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
This is a retrospective, observational, matched case control study of depressed patients treated with antidepressants. Cases were patients who took a specific antidepressant and controls took other antidepressants. The study examined the performance of one antidepressant against others. The study does not determine if the patient should take antidepressants. Instead, for patients whose clinician has prescribed, or will prescribe, an antidepressant, the study clarifies which one has the highest evidence of remission. In this observational study, we will  statistically control for observed confounding and selection bias. The study will focus on confounding by indication.  Confounding by indication means that a comorbidity, procedure, or medication (all measured in the year prior to taking the antidepressant) is associated with selection of the antidepressant and/or the remission outcome.","Anticipated Findings
This study intends to improved accuracy of clinical decision aids by examining effectiveness of antidepressants after statistically removing observed confounding/selection bias in the data.  To remove bias, the study will identified features of patients’ medical history that either predicted remission or affected prescription of antidepressants.

This project is looking to examine the impact of social determinants of health, as deemed by Healthy People 2030, on the management of diabetic retinopathy which includes the diagnosis, treatment, and visit adherence among patients with diabetes. Approximately one out of ten people in the United States have been diagnosed with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in these patients ranging from ages 20-74. Investigating diabetic retinopathy through a socioeconomic lens is crucial to identify populations that are receiving inadequate care for their condition. Once these populations are identified, work can be done to reduce the deficits and gaps in care provided.","Project Purpose(s)

Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
This project will examine patients in the database that are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, including proliferative and non-proliferative. Next, the population that has not visited an eye doctor within the past year will be selected for. One of the main goals of this project is to identify geographic disparity. Moreover, numerous variables among this group will be analyzed as well including, but not limited to, age, gender, self-identified race and ethnicity, level of education, level of income, insurance status, ocular and diabetic drugs prescribed. Subsequently, once the data is gathered, basic quantitative statistics will be run to identify significant correlates between the data and the variables identified.","Anticipated Findings
The aim of this study is to identify certain populations that are at risk of lack of adherence to their eye care. A large gap of knowledge that exists within the ophthalmology community can be addressed by conducting this investigation via a large-scale database which focuses on patients underrepresented in biomedical research such as the National Institute of Health’s All of Us.  The findings will not only inform future interventions, but also allow a more targeted approach to remedying the problem of unequal access to care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of bacterial contribution to the development of vascular disease and identify factors that lead to dysbiosis. We will examine oral and blood pathobiont composition and look for social determinants that affect the microbiome composition, such as smoking history, diabetes, urban/rural setting, etc. We will also look for microbial signatures that influence the type of vascular disease a patient develops (ie, is there a difference between patients with atherosclerotic disease and aneurysmal disease. Is there a difference between patients with different locations of occlusive disease). Our central hypothesis is that bacteria within the mouth and in the blood create small molecules that contribute to the development of vascular disease and different microbial signatures may influence the type of disease a patient develops.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Academic Research - Data will be used to explore questions related to the oral and blood microbiome in vascular surgery patients with the possibility of publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.)","Scientific Approaches

There is a complex relationship between mental and metabolic health, especially in the context of antipsychotic medications and their side effects. Schizophrenia is a very rare psychiatric disorder, yet the medications prescribed for individuals with this disorder have some of the strongest and most adverse metabolic side effects, ranging from rapid weight gain to dysregulation of blood glucose. But what happens if individuals taking certain antipsychotics begin to experience increased A1C and weight gain, common indicators of an increased type 2 diabetes risk? Do these individuals receive standard medical care for diabetes management? How do social and economic factors influence diagnosis, symptom management, and choice of medication?

Other variables of interest in this study are age, sex, income level, education, insurance, diet, and food security. There is little research out there studying Asian Americans as disaggregated group subgroups. As research has evolved, we have realised the importance of studying ethic subgroups because health disparities in these groups can be covered by overarching ethnic groups such as ""Hispanic"" or ""Asian.""

Nearly 2 million people suffer from the autoimmune disease known as Type I Diabetes in the US. Strong genetic components have been found between HLA Class II genes (antigen presenting on T cells) and Type I Diabetes. We are interested in exploring HLA allele frequencies associations for Type I Diabetes in the All of Us cohort, and determining which alleles have higher risk of developing the disease, and whether the known alleles are replicated across different ancestries. We will look at potential other HLA alleles (apart from Class II) that may play a role in the risk for Type I Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 1 diabetes mellitus)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We are interested in accessing the Type I Diabetes to contrast with two control populations: the general population and Type II Diabetes. To generate HLA alleles, we will use imputation methods such as SNP2HLA or DEEP*HLA. Our first attempt will be to replicate previous well-classified HLA associations to determine how well our imputation worked. We will then proceed to determine novel associations using a case-control analysis. We will adjust for population substructure and incorporate local ancestry. We will use the All of Us platform to access de-identified EHR and genomic data in a context that will protect the privacy of participants.","Anticipated Findings
HLA is the most diverse genomic region which makes it difficult to study in traditional association studies. Understanding the variation underpinning Type 1 Diabetes in different ancestry groups will increase our understanding of how the diversity affects the etiology of this autoimmune disorder. Furthermore, given that genetic testing is more prevalent, it will increase care by allowing the identification of high-risk patients before the onset of the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

African Americans experience higher rates of certain types of cancer and often have poorer outcomes compared to other racial and ethnic groups. The relationship between an overexpressed immune signature and cancer comorbidity in African Americans is not fully understood. Multiple factors contribute to the disparities observed in cancer outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups, including socioeconomic factors, access to healthcare, cultural beliefs, and genetic variations. The presence of multiple medical conditions in an individual includes chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or respiratory conditions, which may impact cancer treatment and overall health outcomes by making an overreactive immune system.

Pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes are leading causes of significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is widely known that physical activity may have a protective effect on development of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Per the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, It is currently recommended that pregnant women get at-least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for its benefits. However, there have been no studies that have used strictly recorded real-time data (i.e Fitbit device) on  physical activity to show the exact amount of exercise needed to have benefit to decrease maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.","Project Purpose(s)

Research Question
What is the incidence of heart failure or adverse cardiac events in Black/ African American women who are long-term (5 years or more) survivors of breast cancer?
Why is this question important?
African American (AA) breast cancer survivors may have elevated risk for cardiovascular disease because of the high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in this population.

Diabetes mellitus is a (potentially chronic) disease categorized by excessive concentrations of glucose in the bloodstream and, consequently, the urine—this is colloquially known as “diabetes” (which is what we will be referring to as well). Diabetes mellitus can further be broken into two categories: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Both types have underlying genetic influences, but the main difference is that type 1 is postulated as being caused by the body’s immune system attacking and wreaking havoc on the body's own pancreas, while type 2 has been shown to strongly correlate to physical hypoactivity and obesity. Type 1 used to be called “juvenile diabetes” due to being significantly more common in children and not having been linked to lifestyle factors (e.g., an individual’s own choices).","Project Purpose(s)

For the genomic data collected through All of Us, we will use a sample and variant call rate of >0.98, and filter variants to a MAF>0.01. We will use available imputation with R2>0.5. We will collect the baseline HbA1c and on-treatment HbA1c after index GLP-1 RA. The outcome variable will be baseline minus on-treatment HbA1c, adjusted for baseline . We will similarly calculate change in weight. Discontinuation of the index GLP-1 RA within 3 months will be a proxy for drug intolerance. We will perform GWAS for each endpoint. Multiple linear regression using an additive model will test the association between variants and quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and principal components. For medication discontinuation, logistic regression will be used. Analyses will be computed for each ancestry and meta-analyzed. We will assess for genome-wide significance and experiment-wide significance after Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing.","Anticipated Findings

Diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, fatty liver disease and cancer are the epidemic illnesses of modern life. These diseases often occur together, and one common cause is resistance to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance; IR). When measured in the clinic, IR can strongly predict who will develop these diseases later in life. The causes of IR are both hereditary (genetic) and environmental. There is only one class of drugs, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), that treats IR, but TZDs have serious side effects that prevent their widespread use. If we knew which genes were responsible for changing IR, new and much needed therapies could be developed. Here, we propose to use genetic information from participants in All of Us to find people who are genetically protected from IR and look for the specific genetic variants that confer this protection. The result of this project will be new potential targets for therapeutic development to prevent and treat these epidemic scale chronic diseases.","Project Purpose(s)

We propose to use previously published GWAS for traits related to insulin sensitivity/resistance to construct an insulin resistance genetic risk score composed of a series of SNPs. The score for every participant from All of Us will be computed. The participant score will be regressed against the clinical data of the participants including diabetes, cardiovascular events and incident cancers as well as physiologic measures of body composition and relevant serum chemistries and lipid levels. A quantitative clinical profile will be constructed based on this score that is a composite of diagnoses, physiologic and serum measurements. The whole genome sequencing of subgroups of individuals with extreme clinical profile values will be examined for loss-of-function mutations in protein coding genes.","Anticipated Findings

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

One key measure of diabetes diagnosis is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which reflects blood glucose levels over a period of the past two to three months. However, this lab value has been shown to have a statistically higher mean in minority populations. Specifically, genetic markers implicated in individuals of African ancestry artificially change measured HbA1c levels and potentially make it difficult to diagnose diabetes within this population. We are interested in exploring the effects of this diagnostic and prognostic obstacle on the progression and outcomes of diabetes and subsequent complications in individuals of African ancestry compared to those of other ancestries, including European.","Project Purpose(s)

While HbA1c is a widely relied upon diagnostic and prognostic factor for diabetes, such findings would highlight the need to employ other additional measures of glucose control in order to accurately monitor disease in certain populations.

The objective is to assess the kidneys of diabetes patients who are also HIV positive.
Diabetes is a frequent illness observed in the United States, which can cause harm to numerous systems in the body. Antiretroviral therapy can have a negative effect on kidney function, so close monitoring is strongly advised. To go into more detail, data must be generated to determine how antiretroviral therapy will influence kidney function, and how to manage it.","Project Purpose(s)

The long-term goal of this Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) pilot project is to identify genetic loci associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although diabetes and hypertension are primary risk factors for CKD, genetic factors have also been associated with CKD-defining traits. In this study, we will examine genome sequence variation among individuals in diagnosed with CKD with those not diagnosed with CKD. Our project seeks to: 1) identify putative genetic loci that increase risk for CKD that have not been previously reported; 2) examine associations between known CKD risk loci among individuals in study; and 3) compare genetic data with other CKD studies as a way of assessing whether individuals included in the study are a representative cohort of CKD subjects. Genetic risk loci identified through this study will form the basis for basic biomedical research to define the molecular determinants of disease and provide a platform for the development of effective treatments.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to conduct a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To conduct this study, we will combine de-identified data we plan to generate for 100 CKD patients from Maine with All of Us data. We plan to use All of Us data for both cases and controls. The overall statistical analysis approach consists of three components as follows. First, we will analyze distributions of relevant clinical data from participants, such as eGFR and age separated by sex. Second, we will analyze population stratification using ADMIXTURE (Shringapure et al, 2016) and PLINK (Purcell et al, 2007) to identify any subpopulations that differ genetically and if disease prevalence differs among those subpopulations (Marchini et al, 2004). Distributions of alleles among participants will be compared to reference panels in order to estimate individual ancestry proportions. For the GWAS analysis, genetic associations will be tested using PLINK.","Anticipated Findings

Our aim is to analyze the relationship between gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia in women of different racial backgrounds. Past literature suggests a relationship between gestational diabetes and race, with women of color being disproportionately affected compared to their white counterparts. In addition, it has been suggested that gestational diabetes is a major risk factor for pre-eclampsia. If both of these hold true, we expect to see increased risks for pre-eclampsia with markers associated with gestational diabetes.
Because A1C, triglycerides, MAP, HDL, and BMI are well-studied predictive markers of gestational diabetes, we expect to see a positive relationship between these risk factors and the occurrence of pre-eclampsia in different ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to utilize machine learning (ML) in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in order to identify those individuals who may go on to complications associated with the disease. While there has been extensive research on identifying individuals who may go on to have severe complications due to T2D, we are aiming to identify those individuals who may have more mild-to-moderate complications prior to the development of a more severe condition. As these mild-to-moderate complications may be precursors to more severe complications, we hope to identify who may have these intermediary complications in order to provide early treatment/intervention and limit the development of the more severe conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

From the registered tier, we aim to use a combination of clinical records data (i.e. labs/vitals, procedures, co-morbid conditions, etc.) and the physical information available for each individual. In addition, as research suggests there may be a genetic component to the development of complications in individuals with T2D, we aim to utilize some of the genomic data from the controlled tier to further enhance our dataset. This may be through examining individual polymorphisms associated with T2D and its complications as well as GWAS or PRS data combining multiple genotypic variations. With this data, we will develop a suite of machine learning model using various algorithms in order to robustly develop a model which will best identify those individuals who may develop mild-to-moderate complications of T2D.","Anticipated Findings

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The goal is to determine the rate of LTBI (latent tuberculosis infection) testing in populations at risk. The USPSTF (US Preventive Services Task Force) has concluded with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis (TB) infection. (B recommendation)
Such populations include those who were born in, or resided in, countries with high TB prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (homeless shelters or correctional facilities).
Others who should be screened are immunosuppressed (persons living with HIV, on immunosuppressive medications like chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or after an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis. Persons who are contacts of  those with active TB, healthcare workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings should be screened through occupation health.

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)

We will analyze data from the All of Us Research Program database regarding alcohol consumption behaviors, ALDH2 genotype (rs671), demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. All participants with informative data for rs671 will be included in the study. These data sets will be from surveys, physical measurements, and the genomic data set. Statistical analyses will be done using R or python. We will examine relationships between these factors and alcohol consumption using Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables), overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors, for example, demographics.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Why does the large food consumption cause more adolescent African-American males to have type two diabetes than Caucasian males as grown adults?
This question is important because in some of our families, people are obese, and trying to lose weight sometimes is problematic. We are wondering if obesity can be genetically inherited or is just acquired by bad eating habits. To determine this, we plan to look through the database and determine whether our question is correct.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
The hypothesis is testable since we can take an obese African American individual with type 2 diabetes and compare them to an obese person without type 2 diabetes. We can see if the individual carries the gene and if it is genetically inherited by looking at their parent’s 20th chromosome on their karyotype as well as their own. Research shows that African Americans are more susceptible to having type 2 diabetes while being obese compared to Caucasians. This hypothesis can be fallible because type 2 diabetes isn’t 100% genetically inherited, but genetics play a significant role in its development. It may just be developed due to obesity and has nothing to do with being genetically inherited.","Anticipated Findings
If an African-American male (ages 8-16) without type 2 diabetes is obese, they are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than a Caucasian male (ages 8-16) who is obese without type 2 diabetes.

Finding this to be true will allow for further research on the impact of other socioeconomic factors, like environment, education, and employment, on diabetes within the same demographic. Finding it to be false enables more research on the influences of low income itself. Diabetes within the black community is a health disparity that needs to be addressed with more concern. Discovering which situations are most impactful narrows down how to accurately address and prevent the epidemic.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Most of our traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. This research focuses on the genetic contributions and in particular on those to different disease risks. What regions of our DNA affect which traits and how much? Can we use DNA to identify individuals at high risk for a certain disease and take preventive measures early or perhaps even before an onset of the disease? For many diseases, such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease, the answer to this question is already yes. By looking at up to tens of thousands DNA locations, specific to each disease, it is possible to estimate the genetic disease risk. These predictions are not exact but are good enough to already be used clinically saving lives and limiting the severity of diseases. The main purpose of this project is to develop and validate methods to make such risk predictions from DNA and to make this technology equally available to all of us, regardless of our genetic backgrounds.","Project Purpose(s)

Commercial","Scientific Approaches
This research project is using various machine learning algorithms (computer programs), such as L1-penalized regression, elastic nets, Bayesian regressions, random forests, and neural networks. All of them require large datasets with genetic information paired with different phenotypes, e.g. disease status, blood pressure, past surgeries, etc. The phenotypes are either used as ""the answer"", what you try to teach the algorithm to predict, or other factors that you are trying to compensate for (e.g. if you are trying to predict blood pressure, you may want to correct for use of blood thinning medications). The data needs to be quality controlled and prepared for effective analysis which involves a multitude of statistical tools, including principal component analyses, data transformations and subsampling. Where available, we will also use sibling analyses. Siblings typically share childhood environments making the such data particularly useful for studies of the genetic effects.","Anticipated Findings
The validation aspect of the project will tell us how well already existing predictors (trained on other datasets) are performing. This evaluation on a completely independent dataset is the best way to get an honest measure of how well the predictor works (metrics we use are primarily AUC, variation explained, correlation, and odds ratios). The extraordinary advantage All of Us has is its diversity which will provide answers about the predictor performance not only on the subpopulations used for training but on populations from very different ancestries, environments and lifestyles. This is an invaluable tool to characterize and minimize performance differences that historically have arisen due to skewed data availability.
The validation results will guide the development phase which will yield new methods, predictors and tools to combine different types of information for the most accurate disease risk and health predictions possible, for each one of us.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My partner and I intend to answer the question: do physical factors such as BMI, mean waist circumference, and mean hip circumference constitute a higher risk factor for coronary heart disease? We also aim to find if there is a correlation between type II diabetes and coronary heart disease and if genetic risk factors for diabetes also increase the prevalence of coronary heart disease. Finally, we wish to find if there is a particular age range, gender, and ethnicity that is at a higher risk for coronary heart disease. We aim to explore this dataset to help determine if certain groups may be at a higher risk for coronary heart disease according to their genomic makeup.  If we can determine how select groups are more prone to coronary heart disease from an examination of their genome, mortality rates could be lowered through an emphasis on lifestyle changes and disease prevention.","Project Purpose(s)

My partner and I plan to compare mean waist circumference, mean hip circumference, and BMI to the prevalence of coronary heart disease in comparison to these factors. We also plan to look for genetic risk factors linked to type II diabetes and the diagnosis of participants with coronary artery disease. Through this, we hope to see if genetic links to type II diabetes can also be linked to coronary heart disease. Next, we plan to take a randomized group of individuals or a wide range of ages, genders, and ethnicities and compare the prevalence of coronary artery disease among the different ages, genders, and ethnicities and see if we can determine if there is a specific group that may be at a higher risk.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate finding those who are older, male, and white to have a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease. We also anticipate finding a correlation between genetic mutations in genes linked to Type II diabetes and coronary artery disease. Finally, we expect to see a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease in those with increased BMI, increased mean waist circumference, and increased mean hip circumference.  Our findings can hopefully encourage groups we find to be high risk to get regular screenings, as well as potentially work to create a change in the mean waist and hip circumference.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been decade after decade the greatest infectious disease killer globally. 1.6 million died in 2021.
Diagnosis, lack of access to healthcare, difficulty adhering to and completing regimens, and other comorbidities (HIV, diabetes, cancer, immunosuppression such as for autoimmune disorders) worsen TB outcomes. TB in the US is often in those who are foreign born, those who are older, associated with lack of housing or incarceration, and those with other comorbidities.

EHR diagnosis codes use for billing are known to be rife with inaccuracies. For example, a patient may be evaluated for diabetes mellitus but then have a diabetes mellitus code assigned to their chart. As a result, using the structured diagnosis codes in an analysis may give inaccurate conclusions. For large genetic studies, one way to improve the code accuracy is to only consider patients as having the disease as those with at least two diagnosis codes on different days. There are other simple heuristics that could be applied to improve accuracy across various disease by incorporating temporal patterns of various features. This project aims to study these temporal patterns to see if there is a rule that can be used to improve the accuracy of identifying patients with specific diseases.","Project Purpose(s)

Our main research aim is to understand the genetic basis of type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, related metabolic traits, and their complications. We have previously identified dozens of loci associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility and glycemic traits, providing insights into genetic architecture and novel biology. We aim to extend these studies using data from the All of Us Research Program. We also plan to use these data to evaluate novel methods for gene-environment interaction and other novel methods and  approaches to analyze multiple phenotypes simultaneously.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use the entire All of Us cohort to understand the genetic basis of type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, related metabolic traits, and complications of diabetes. We will use methods for (1) the discovery of genetic associations of diabetes and related outcomes [genome-wide association studies], (2) discovery of genetic modification effects related to environmental and exposure factors [genome-wide gene-environment interaction  studies], and (3) genetic risk prediction of our outcomes of interest [polygenic risk prediction], and (4) variations and extension of the methods described in (1) - (3). We will use tools that are ""standard analysis software"" for genetic epidemiology (i.e. published in a peer reviewed journal) and/or code in the R programming language or the python programming language that will be released under an open source license for transparency and reproducibility.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that the findings of our study will expand our understanding of the genetic basis (or genetic architecture) of type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, related metabolic traits, and complications of diabetes, particularly in the context of modifiable exposures such as physical activity, diet, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption and other risk factors for diabetes and cardio-metabolic disease (heart attack, stroke, etc.). We anticipate that we will build models of disease risk prediction that leverage common and rate genetic variation, exposures, and the diversity within the All of Us cohort.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes caused by a single highly penetrant variant. A majority of MODY cases are caused by pathogenic variants in three genes: HNF1A, HNF4A and GCK. The prevalence and penetrance of pathogenic variants in MODY-associated genes is still relatively unclear. Proper identification and diagnosis of MODY is important as the condition has treatment implications differ from other forms of diabetes . For example, first line treatment for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY subtypes is sulfonylureas vs. insulin in type 1 or metformin in type 2. For GCK-MODY, pharmacologic treatment is unnecessary except in some cases. The goals of this project are two-fold. We are interested in better understanding the prevalence and penetrance of these variants in the AoU cohort. We are interested in understanding how well treatments prescribed match clinical guidelines indicated by genetic etiology for  those with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic MODY variant.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) )
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will identify individuals in the cohort with a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in one of the MODY-associated genes using classifications from the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel for Variation Curation, which is a group of physicians, geneticists, and laboratory pathologists that work on MODY.   From the eligible individuals, we will look at diagnosis of diabetes, age of diagnosis, family history of diabetes, and treatment information. We will be using methods for penetrance estimate based on previous work by Mirshahi et al. 2022 (PMID 36257325). Because of phenotypic and onset differences between HNF1A/HNF4A MODY and GCK MODY, we will use two separate methodologies to estimate penetrance. To estimate the penetrance of diabetes for those with a HNF1A or HNF4A variant, we will use Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. For those with a GCK variant, we will use Fisher’s exact test to estimate the penetrance for mild hyperglycemia.","Anticipated Findings
By gaining an estimate for the prevalence and penetrance of known MODY-associated variants, we will have a better understanding of how common these variants are in the population and how likely a variant will result in disease.   Although there has been previous work done in this area, it has been completed predominately in White-European cohorts  and, to our knowledge, not in a healthy US cohort. Through this project, we will be able to gain insights regarding MODY variants in diverse groups living in the United States. By analyzing treatments being used for MODY, we will be able to understand the current clinical landscape for MODY and identify potential areas of improvement. We hope that this work will lead to a better understanding of the presence of MODY-associated variants in the US and better improve health outcomes for individuals with this condition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 1%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD) and related health conditions (e.g., depression and pain).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Second, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The fresh start effect refers to the notion that individuals are more likely to initiate positive changes in their lives following significant events such as birthdays, new years, or other personal milestones. Prior research has demonstrated the fresh start effect on various health outcomes, including glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, the extent to which the fresh start effect influences hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values in patients with diabetes around their birthdays is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with diabetes experience improvements in glycemic control around their birthdays.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
This will be a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records (EMR) of patients with diabetes. The study will include patients aged 18 years and older who have been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and have at least two HbA1c measurements recorded in the EMR within six months before and six months after their birthday. Patients who have missing data or incomplete medical records will be excluded from the study. HbA1c values will be extracted from the EMR and compared between the six-month period before and after the patient's birthday. Paired t-tests will be used to compare HbA1c values between the two periods. Multiple regression analysis will be used to adjust for potential confounding variables, such as age, sex, race, and comorbidities.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to find that patients with diabetes will have lower HbA1c values in the six-month period after their birthday compared to the six-month period before their birthday, indicating a fresh start effect on glycemic control.

Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The scientific approaches that we plan to use for this study, is breaking our inquiry down into 3 specific parts. The first would be recording how genes encoded for this disease are inherited, and their mode of transmission. For that we need to look at pedigrees or flowcharts showing a typical scenario of how an individual could inherit this condition, and compare those probabilities to other unusual scenarios. For example, an offspring may be the carrier for the gene that encodes for diabetes, but may never experience it, due to their lifestyle choices. The other two parts of this research will focus on analyzing complex genes that encode for this condition and how environmental factors affect the mutation rate of these genes and the expression of them over different populations in different environments, regardless of income, or race, but more focusing on type of environment (urban/rural), access to resources, and age.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings in this study would be to unravel the difficulty behind the diagnosis of this disease. Though diabetes is directly related insulin resistance, it wears many hats that we do not know of. It can be a comorbidity to an autoimmune illness, developed by an unhealthy lifestyle, or diagnosed in the neonatal development of the offspring. By drawing connections and analyzing these findings, we can deduce why diabetes can be an apparent risk to anyone regardless of their health circumstances good or bad. Our scientific knowledge can contribute to the field of genetics research and disease, in the fact that it can help produce a possible solution in how we pinpoint its growth.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Unmodeled heterogeneity of the biological underpinnings of phenotypes reduces statistical power and reproducibility in downstream analyses such as genome-wide association studies. While some complex diseases have well-established clinically-relevant subtypes that respond differently to different treatments (e.g., diabetes and asthma), heterogeneity is suspected but has not so far been demonstrated for many other phenotypes. Existing data-driven subtyping methods primarily rely on data clustering methods that are not guaranteed to capture genetically- or clinically-relevant stratification of patients, thus, impeding our ability to take an important step towards personalized medicine by defining treatment at the subphenotypic level. The goal of this proposal is to enable a robust identification of clinically-relevant subphenotypic variation given no prior knowledge.","Project Purpose(s)

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between dental infections (as consequence of dental caries and pulp necrosis) and additional diseases (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) although limitations of such studies hamper conclusive interpretations . We showed that apical periodontitis (pulp necrosis with bone resorption) was strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease; further, we identified an association between an established hypertension-associated gene with apical periodontitis in a well-characterized population. These findings strongly indicate that a shared genetic etiology could contribute to oral health-systemic health relationships. By using All of Us data, we hope to validate our previous findings and expand knowledge of the etiology linking oral health and systemic health. We will identify additional factors (social determinants of health) that may play a role in the interconnectedness between oral health and general health.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Set of conditions - dental infections, diabetes and cardiovascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Data available via All of Us research workbench shows 20 dental infection conditions that reflect a continuum of dental infection (i.e., dental caries, pulpal and periapical conditions) of interest. We are interested to investigate if relationships exist between these dental infection conditions with type 2 diabetes, hypertensive disorder, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart murmur and cerebrovascular accident.
We will access demographic, clinical (dental and medical) and genetic data from individuals with the above conditions (no exclusions based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or genetic ancestry). We will test for association between a set of conditions, and will also identify potential genes/variants associated with a combined phenotype of dental infection + systemic condition using a variety of tools and statistical methods. All of Us data will allow us to identify a large sample of unrelated controls to increase confidence in the results.","Anticipated Findings
Much of the controversial findings in epidemiological and genetic association studies looking at oral/dental and systemic conditions is due to differences in populations studied, data ascertainment methodologies, but mainly due to limited sample sizes. This study will leverage high-quality demographic/clinical and genomic data of a large and diverse dataset that will allow the best (largest) evidence to date.

In order to understand the relationship of platelets and how abnormal counts can affect or lead to patients with diseases and disorders, we will be looking for relationships in various problems including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
Questions to be researched are as follows:
1. How do patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease compare to those without in the general population in relationship to platelet count?
2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures.

2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as type-2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease has dramatically increased in the last two generations. One source of rising prevalence has been argued to be decanalization, a special class of genotype-by-environment interactions to study the evolution of human wellness with respect to changing environment. The recent lifestyle and behavioral shifts such as sedentary nature, low physical activity or socioeconomic disparities lead to increase in genetic effects on the disease over time. Here we ask the question – how the rapid cultural shifts of the modern environment interact with polygenic risk and influence disease susceptibility.  We previously sought evidence of this process through a comparison of prevalence of phenotypes as a function of polygenic scores with respect to environments across complex traits and common diseases and aim to replicate our findings as well as extend the methods.","Project Purpose(s)

In this cross-sectional study, we will use information from the electronic medical record (EMR) and survey responses from adults (age 18+). We will query the EMR for hemoglobin A1c measurements (HbA1c), and EMR diagnoses of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The population will be stratified by diabetes status based on EMR data: no diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%), prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 6.4%).

One of the most prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs metformin has been utilized in many treatments in breast cancer patients during and prior to diagnosis. These associations provided a strong rationale to study the association of metformin use in clinical care of women with breast cancer, particularly due to the nature of insulin. In addition, changes derived from insulin resistance in patients with metformin use have been involved in tumor development, aggressiveness, treatment response, and poorer prognosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of patients with breast carcinoma in association to prior metformin use in histological phenotypes of African, Hispanics, and Asian American Populations in the United States.","Project Purpose(s)

Assess the performance of a commonly used prediction model of diabetes complications in a more diverse population.
The risk engine from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) is built into the vast majority of clinical and economic decision models currently used in the US, despite considerable limitations: UKPDS began in 1977, is based on a cohort 5,100 British diabetics, and minority groups typical in US patient populations were not represented at all. In addition, relationships between predictors and health outcomes are likely to have changed over the past 40 years in which there were large changes in health risks as well as treatments. This workspace analyzes trajectories of diabetes complications for underrepresented groups and contrasts it to predictions from the UKPDS.","Project Purpose(s)

An observational cohort study with outcomes compared to those of a simulation model. The inclusion criterion is a diagnosis of diabetes (when using EHR, this will follow the identification algorithm used in Kaiser Permanente studies). Those individuals are then followed over time , recording complications related to diabetes. When possible given the sample sizes, we reestimate the equations used by UKPDS (a set of interaction continuous time duration models). The main limitations will be sample size, both in terms of individuals in a particular group and duration of follow-up.","Anticipated Findings

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the US working adult population. Recent studies of factors related to DR have begun to incorporate social determinants of health (SDoH). Generally defined as the economic, social, and physical conditions that influence the health status of patients, SDoH have revealed barriers and facilitators to routine eye care and DR progression. While previous studies have identified SDoH associated with DR, they have not explored longitudinal associations.

We will conduct a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of family history of common chronic diseases in diverse All of Us participants. We will also investigate the risk of various chronic diseases based on reporting a  family history of the same disease or other diseases. We will investigate factors associated with increased familial risks such as age of onset of disease, number of affected relatives and other covariates. Family history is considered one of the most important risk factors for health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and other chronic conditions. Even though many researchers have studied risk of family history of few chronic conditions, the family history module of All of Us research data set contains 104 different conditions that can be analyzed to assess familial risk in more details.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use simple descriptive analyses and logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios of family history of chronic conditions adjusted for demographic characteristics and other variables available in personal medical history, lifestyle, and the basic modules of the survey. We will also look for interactions between family history and other modifiable risk factors on disease risks","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show the percentage of survey participants with a family history of chronic disease out of those who have that disease and the association of the chronic disease with the family history of that disease. Each year since 2004, the Surgeon General has declared Thanksgiving to be National Family History Day, and encourages Americans to use his ""My Family Health Portrait"" which is an internet-based tool that makes it easy to record family health history. However, information on family health history on currently available surveys are limited to few chronic diseases. Our findings using All of Us data would contribute to expand the knowledge of how family history is been reported by various populations and how it may be related to the risks of various chronic diseases. The unique and diverse large population of the All of Us are ideal for “feeling the pulse” of family health history reporting in the United States.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The specific question we hope to answer is whether individuals with rosacea and a normal BMI have a higher prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) compared to individuals with a normal BMI. It has been previously discovered that individuals with a normal BMI have higher rates of T2DM compared to a population with a non-normal BMI. This question is important in the screening and hopeful prevention of T2DM.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Rosacea)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use a quantitative approach and create two datasets. One dataset will include individuals with a normal BMI that do and do not have rosacea. The second dataset will include individuals with a non-normal BMI that do and do not have rosacea. From this, we can describe summary statistics and also analyze through a t-test whether rosacea is significantly correlated with T2DM in individuals with T2DM.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study will be the determination of rosacea as a potential risk factor or association with T2DM in the general population.

Diabetes remains an overwhelming public health burden in the United States with the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes reaching an estimated 8.7% of the adult population in 2019. Among patient with DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Importantly, the burden of disease is not shared equally across the population; racial and socioeconomic disparities are evident in recent DM data.
The goal of this project is to use the All of Us Research Program database to explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in composite CVD risk factor control amongDM patients with and without CVD. We want to know 1. Among patients with diabetes mellitus with and without CVD, what is the extent of composite risk factor control (BP, HbA1c, LDL-C, BMI, tobacco status, activity level? 2. How is race, ethnicity, sex, income, and healthcare access associated with number of risk factors at target for control?","Project Purpose(s)

Insulin pump systems offer improved glycemic control and reduced morbidity and mortality in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In recent years, insulin pumps have increasingly been paired with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to automate insulin delivery and reduce user input.

Similar barriers also likely exist for the use of oral antihyperglycemic medications that require investigation of insulin resistance profiles in patients receiving care at specialized centers. The goal of this study is to identify socioeconomic disparities in T1DM management in a large national cohort. Specifically, we aim to (1) characterize insulin pump system use across race/ethnicity among patients in the United States, (2) characterize insulin pump complications among patients in the United States, and (3) characterize oral anti-hyperglycemic medicationn use in T1DM using the All of Us database.","Project Purpose(s)

Due to the far-reaching effects of metabolic dysregulation, the All of Us dataset makes it possible for us to examine PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on various phenotypes and disorders.
PAS Kinase (PASK) is a protein that responds to glucose availability and regulates glucose metabolism in yeast, mice, and humans. Metabolic issues contribute to diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Publications have shown a relationship between conditions such as those listed above and PASK. Our research aims to find genetic associations between PASK and two of its substrates with various disease phenotypes. We will accomplish this using data provided by the All of Us dataset, which includes lab measurements and whole genome sequencing. We will perform a linear regression analysis to find associations between PASK gene variants among diverse ancestries to find new trends and associations between various metabolic issues and phenotypical expression.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We propose to discover associations between USF1, ATXN2, and PASK to analyze their variation in conjunction with blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, blood count, lipid panels, and urinalysis using the All of Us dataset.
We will utilize the All of Us dataset to find associations between PASK, USF1, and ATXN2and their phenotypes in diverse ancestry groups. Regression analyses will present our findings.
Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) will look at common and rare variants found in the PASK, USF1, and ATXN2. Using diverse data, we can better indicate significant variations between these genes and make applicable findings for all people. Efforts to ensure ancestrally varying datasets improve contributions made in medicine to make progress towards personalized care. European, African, Asian, and Hispanic populations are all included in the All of Us dataset, which will guarantee more accurate associations made in our study.","Anticipated Findings
Our final goal will be to show associations between these three genes of interest with disease phenotypes. We expect to see significant phenotype-gene associations in various areas due to the central nature of lipid and respiratory metabolism and the role of their dysregulation in many diseases.   We will publish our findings in a peer-reviewed article which will be part of a more extensive publication. The publication will include information from the genome-wide association study described in this proposal. It will also include data collected from a phenome-wide association study, identifying associated disease phenotypes for PASK, USF1, and ATXN2. Next fall, I will present the data as a poster at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG).

Logistic regression models will be used to select predictors of diabetic diagnosis from potential candidate variables, including demographics, general health, behavior and lifestyle, disease history, lab and prescription medications. First, univariable association of all the potential predictors will be evaluated (i.e., entered into the survey logistic regression models one at a time), and those with statistically significant association will then be entered together into a multivariable regression model. The final multivariable model will retain all variables that remain statistically significant. Statistical significance will be assessed by two-sided P values of< 0.05, with no adjustments for multiple testing. Odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) will be estimated and presented for predictors selected in the final models.","Anticipated Findings

I want to understand how we decide what type of health care to get and when. My premise is that we seek care that has value to us... meaning achieving a desired outcome at an acceptable cost but value for an individual may differ from value for a health system.
Aim 1 :  Determine predictors for utilizing health care resources and determine if use of different resources leads to differential health outcomes
For example, does using Urgent Care versus Primary care affect health outcomes for individuals with different health backgrounds?
Aim 2 : Recreate nationally used quality metrics for the All of Us population and determine benchmarks for these measures.
A simple example would be patients with diabetes whose hemoglobin A1C is higher than a standard.
Aim 3 : Using the recreated metrics, determine predictors of ""success"" and identify potential areas where value to an individual conflicts with value to a physician or health care system or insurer.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Aim 1  : Pull out data applicable to patient's stated preference for health care and compare it to the actual visit codes. Correlate visit codes in different settings to diagnoses, social determinants of health, and, notably, to health outcomes.
Aim 2 :  Using the EHR and self report data bases, recreate quality metrics used for ratings and quality payment methodologies. Establish national and regional benchmarks for these measures and explore variations by SDOH, diagnoses, comorbidities.
Aim 3 : Take the quality metrics data created in Aim 2 and determine the value proposition for these metrics for individuals versus institutions by comparing outcomes versus approximate health care costs (annualized)","Anticipated Findings
Many of the quality and value based care metrics used by insurers and health care systems have not been examined nationally to establish benchmarks.
Further, the underlying assumptions of many metrics has not included the patient's perspective on the value to them.
Identifying both benchmarks and the discrepancies in perception of value in health care  will enable the development of systems that connect patients to excellent health care that meets both their goals and the health systems goals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Is covid-19 and its relationship to diabetes in Hispanic/Latino communities different among different genders, geographical areas or wealth brackets?
Is there reverse causality between Ethnicity and Diabetes and Covid-19?
Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect resulting in more than 6 million deaths.  It has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy.
Type 2 diabetes is an expanding global health problem. Individuals with T2DM are at high risk for both microvascular complications and macrovascular complications owing to hyperglycaemia and individual components of the insulin resistance syndrome.

Determine the association of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the screening patterns of GDM.
Increasing the effectiveness of healthcare by improving patient experience, outcomes, overall population health, and reducing healthcare costs is at the heart of U.S. healthcare quality improvement (Berwick, D. M, et al 2017). Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity continue to pose significant problems in healthcare for non-Hispanic black Americans. Billions of dollars are spent each year on medical resources and lost productivity. However, GDM is not well studied to mitigate its contribution to the increase of T2DM. For instance, the global burden of disease only includes GDM within “other maternal disorders” (Other maternal disorders - level 2 cause 2020). With the increase in minority and older populations, it is necessary to identify the optimal screening method for GDM by addressing upstream social determinants of health that prevent screening for GDM.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Educational","Scientific Approaches
We will conduct a binary logistic regression analysis to assess if the independent variables – patients' demographic and socioeconomic predict the dependent variable – when GDM was screened (Normal – 0 and Early – 1). Binary logistic regression is used for studies where the dependent variable is a categorical variable with a dichotomous outcome (Pituch and Stevens, 2015).
The reference category will be Normal (GDM screening between 24th to 28th weeks of gestation). The analysis will be done at the individual level. Odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value will be presented for the outcome variable. The analysis will be done with SAS Student edition software.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that there will be a difference in how women screen for GDM between race/ethnic groups as well as between socioeconomic groups. By identifying how upstream factors (Social determinants of health) impact population health, we might be able to propose strategies that are both cost-saving and effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (substance use disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will examine the relationship between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and CRP by regressing CRP on the cannabis use measures in the All of Us dataset. All models will control for covariates including age, sex, race and BMI. We may construct additional models that covary for comorbid conditions such as depression or asthma. Additionally, we will examine demographic counts for the variables of interest in our study.","Anticipated Findings
We would anticipate to find an association between cannabis use and CRP levels, with cannabis use in the last three months being associated with lower CRP levels. On the other hand, we would expect to find that cannabis use disorder (or some other measure of heavy use) is associated with higher CRP levels. This project could help untangle how the relationship between cannabis use and CRP changes according to level of cannabis use. It may also give insight into whether this relationship is confounded by other conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The scientific questions we are going to study are:
Are there differences in mechanisms responsible for the development and outcomes of cancer between diabetics and non-diabetics?

This is important because the number of patients with diabetes is increasing, and if there are different mechanisms by which patients with diabetes develop cancer, we can create tailored treatments for these patients.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Type 2 diabetes, cancer)","Scientific Approaches
We will create a dataset of patients with diabetes who develop cancer and a dataset of patients without diabetes who develop cancer. We will data mine variables that are associated with diabetes risk assessment, such as BMI, A1C, blood glucose, age, etc., for both cohorts. We will use logistic regression models to understand which variables are significant to cancer development for both cohorts, and also use supervised machine learning models to predict cancer development using our variables for different types of cancers. We will also data mine diabetic medications and conduct survival analyses to determine if there are specific treatments that work better/worse for different cancers.","Anticipated Findings

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions.

It’s estimated 5 million of the 18 million americans in the US with diabetes do not know they have it. Early diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes is important so that patients can begin to manage the disease early and potentially prevent or delay the serious disease complications that can decrease quality of life. Some of these complications include premature heart disease and stroke, blindness, limb amputations, and kidney failure. Our project will review clinical data to estimate each patient’s diabetes risk, which will help identify high risk individuals who may need to seek medical attention.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Given the importance of being able to correctly give early diagnosis, this team places a stronger importance for our model on predictive performance, which leads the team to initially lean towards using random forest or boosting (particularly XGBoost) models.  These more complex models might not be as interpretable, and take longer to run, but they generally yield a much higher out-of-sample performance, which is the main goal of this team’s project.  The team will also look into how well a CART model performs with the dataset given that a CART tree, if it is not too complex, would offer that interpretability for the end users of this research project.  It is important to note that a CART model would be used in lieu of a more complex model if it performs on par with the more complex models.","Anticipated Findings
The overall goal of the project is to assist doctors with treating patients. Ideally, the data analysis would provide doctors with a model of what age range a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on his/her risk factors. If we can provide doctors with this information, then they can have a conversation with patients about preventative care, such as lifestyle changes, in advance of that age to try to prevent patients from developing diabetes. It also allows doctors to know when to start testing patients’ A1C levels to diagnose diabetes so the disease can be treated as quickly as possible. This prevents the untreated disease from wreaking havoc on the patients’ bodies, preventing complications from diabetes down the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The long term goal of our work is to improve the diagnosis and clinical management of diabetes subtypes by translating recent advances in our understanding of genetic risk factors for diabetes.  We study the role of rare and common genetic variants in diabetes type 1, type 2, and subtypes of monogenic diabetes. We use genetic data in combination with clinical and other variables to develop risk models to better identify individuals with diabetes subtypes.  We test the utility of previously developed genetic risk scores for type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the MyCode cohort and determine the impact of rare disease-associated genetic variants.  The Allofus cohort will allow us to validate and refine our findings from admixed ancestry in a  large diverse population.

We also plan to develop risk models for diabetes subtypes, including monogenic diabetes using machine learning approaches.","Anticipated Findings
We plan to use data from Allofus to validate findings from the MyCode cohort, in particular, findings from admixed populations.

We will be able to compare pathogenic variants of monogenic diabetes between the cohorts and ascertain phenotypic spectrum, prevalence, and penetrance of diabetes genes.  We will use the Allofus population to validate any risk models developed.
Achieving our goals will lead to possibility of further genetic studies into the phenotype, progression and complications of diabetes subtypes.  The risk models for diabetes subtypes will be provided freely on a server and available for clinicians to use.

We are interested in the conditions that accompany obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are conditions that are risk factors for OSA, so we expect to see those prior to a diagnosis of the sleep problem. There are also many comorbidities of OSA, such as cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and diabetes. We believe that there may be mechanisms underlying OSA and these comorbidities that are present before diagnosis. We therefore want to look at when co-occurring conditions occur before and after a diagnosis of OSA. We also wish to assess those conditions in people without OSA as a comparison.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (obstructive sleep apnea)","Scientific Approaches
We will look at conditions relative to the date of diagnosis of OSA. We will assess the timeline of occurrence of events (diagnosis, survey, vital) relative to OSA, and assess the conditions that occur early, simultaneously or late. We will look at the conditions commonly associated with OSA (CV disease, mental health, etc) in people without indication of a sleep disorder, and see whether the timeline and severity differs with the OSA group.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to see conditions occurring prior to a diagnosis of OSA. This would suggest 1) that we may be detecting OSA late, and that these conditions may be potentially able to help improve screening for OSA, and 2) we may identify possible underlying pathophysiology that could be present in OSA that is also contributing to other health problems.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Is the way cortisol concentration changes throughout the day associated with how fast glucose is cleared from the blood stream? This question is important because the result could inform the creation of a new risk factor for type 2 diabetes, or a new way to predict the development of type 2 diabetes or severity of insulin resistance. This information could also inform future treatment  development for pre-diabetics and diabetics.","Project Purpose(s)

Data will include all participants who have both a cortisol measurement and an oral glucose tolerance test. Cox proportional hazard model and linear and logistic regression will be used to find associations, calculate odds ratios, and calculate relative risk. Sex, age, diabetes diagnosis, body mass index, race/ethnicity, and medication use will be adjustments in the models.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that people with higher morning cortisol will have poorer oral glucose tolerance test results (it will take them longer to clear the glucose from their blood stream).

The aim of this study is to investigate if Pyridoxine use can benefit diabetics in preventing long term complications by inhibiting formation of activated glycation end products and improving clinical outcomes.
Diabetes and hyperglycemia are affecting over 415 million people worldwide, and by 2040 the number is expected to increase to 642 million. Chronic hyperglycemia results in the glycation of proteins and other biomolecules resulting in generation of AGEs. Glycation can be identified as the core reason for diabetes associated disorders. The interaction of AGEs with their receptor elicits oxidative stress and as a result evokes proliferative, inflammatory, thrombotic and fibrotic reactions in a variety of cells. Therefore, inhibiting the glycation process might be an effective way to prevent the complications of chronic hyperglycemia.","Project Purpose(s)

Findings have clinical implications for prevention (e.g., vaccines), screenings, and treatments, post SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Moreover, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 will disproportionately impact underserved populations whom are at an increased risk for chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary).","Project Purpose(s)

The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is incompletely understood. It is commonly believed that the disease encompasses several distinct entities, which we are unable to appropriately sub-classify at present. Access to large datasets with genetic and clinical phenotypic information provide an ideal opportunity to conduct analyses that might improve our understanding of T2D and related traits, particularly within underserved or underrepresented populations. We therefore have two main aims: (1) understand the genetic basis of T2D and related traits and (2) determine whether T2D might be classified into subtypes of disease.","Project Purpose(s)

To achieve these goals, we plan on performing association analyses between T2D-related traits and genetic variants typed in the All of Us cohort, extending our previous work on the genetics of T2D to diverse populations. We will also test whether the variants associated with these traits, or risk scores that combine genetic and phenotypic variables, also impact related traits/outcomes, to further characterize the impact of these variants or the disease subtypes described by them on health. We will use combinations of traits and Mendelian randomization techniques to assess causality between traits. Additionally, we will apply clustering approaches to the data in order to identify potential subtypes of T2D.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to gain a better understanding of the genetic architecture of T2D within diverse, non-white populations, advancing equity in the field of T2D genetics. Our results will: (1) generate new insights into the underlying causes of T2D, providing new clues to possible therapies, (2) greatly enrich our understanding of the genetic architecture of polygenic traits, especially focused on rare variants, and (3) improve methods for identifying subgroups within heterogeneous traits; such methods will be useful for many groups studying many different phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How do data from the All of Us database compare against known data sources that are considered to be representative of the general population and have been traditionally used in vision health surveillance activities (such as NHANES, NHIS, etc.)? How does All of Us compare to existing big-data sources such as IQVIA?
There is increasing interest in understanding how social factors impact health and vision outcomes. Social determinants of health are important considerations for disease management and prognosis, and our representative use case (diabetes and diabetic retinopathy) has huge implications for our health system as  the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment among working-age adults in the United States. By answering the above questions, we can determine whether the All of Us database is representative and may be broadly generalizable for future studies.","Project Purpose(s)

-	Potential analyses:
o	Look at state/regional variations
o	Examine demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity) of cohorts across data sources
-	Identify areas of similarity/alignment vs. differences","Anticipated Findings
If we are able to demonstrate that the All of Us database is representative and aligns with existing nationwide data sources, then findings regarding links between social determinants and vision health outcomes using All of Us would be felt to be more broadly generalizable. On the other hand, if there are major discrepancies between All of Us and previously established data sources, this would be important information for the vision research community to be aware of, and this could even inform future efforts to make the database more representative.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings

Age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (A2ND) contribute to the second leading cause of death worldwide and account for the majority of life-years lost to disability. As the global population ages, the prevalence and societal impact of A2ND will become ever greater with annual costs in the US expected to exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2050. The management and treatment of A2ND risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, might delay or prevent A2ND onset. To this point, an untreated risk factor generates a cascade that with time increases in complexity and ultimately results in A2ND. Our aim is to select risk factor profiles that are targetable with a drug class and assess if a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics can disrupt the risk cascade modifying A2ND onset.  We aim to include in our analyses demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, genotype, disease stage, socioeconomic status) to stratify efficacy of each therapeutic for AD prevention in a given population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (neurodegenerative disease)","Scientific Approaches
Our first analysis will examine most common A2ND diagnosis incidence rates in subjects with long-term use of a drug targeting a specific risk factor in comparison to subjects with no drug use.  We will focus, first on preventative drugs within classes such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogen modulating therapeutics, psychiatric drugs and therapeutics targeting the inflammatory and metabolic system. Factors such as race, age, gender, genotype (e.g. APOE for Alzhimer's Disease (AD))  and other co-morbidities will be used to determine populations of subjects in which this preventative effect is most pronounced. Our second analysis will evaluate possible therapeutic effects on A2ND diagnosis. For this, cognitive measures in subjects with long-term use of a therapeutic will be compared to those in subjects with no known use while accounting for variability in age, gender and race. The drug effect on cognitive scores will be examined in sub-populations defined by their genotype.","Anticipated Findings
Previous work from our group has shown benefits of treating AD risk factors with commonly used therapeutics (statins, estrogen replacement, selective estrogen receptor modulators, etc) to reduce AD onset. Of clinical importance, there may be selective benefits for  specific genotype patients with and the ability to advance a precision prevention approach for AD. Going forward, key issues to be explored are sex differences in response to therapy, genotypes and phenotypes most appropriate for a given therapy and which specific therapies have greatest preventative efficacy in the context of other variables such as sex, ApoE genotype, and other comorbidities. Results of our pilot analyses and the work proposed here will contribute to a growing body of evidence indicative of therapeutic benefit of AD risk factor treatment in a responder subset and thus have the potential to impact risk and course of Alzheimer's disease. We will extend our analysis to other neurodegenerative disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asian Americans recorded the fastest growth rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the US between 2019 and 2020. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension occur at high rates within the Asian American community but are masked by high socioeconomic status, education, and health insurance.  Undoubtedly, with this rapid growth, pre-existing health disparities in the Asian-American community will become magnified. Currently, Asian Americans are more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) despite having a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
Researchers have been unable to identify health trends within Asian American subgroups. In this study, we aim to examine the prevalence of T2D among the Asian American cohort of the All of Us Research Program, which may differ within each ethnic subgroup. How do the rates of T2D, as diagnosed by hemoglobin A1C, differ among Asian American racial subgroups?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a retrospective observational study with the All of Us cohort data. We plan to access the EHR of participants within Asian American subgroups. Within the EHR’s, T2D will be defined as diagnosed by a physician or measured by HA1C levels. We plan to use SPSS or R to run the statistical analysis. We plan to use a one-way ANOVA to investigate if our single independent variable, the racial subgroup, will have an effect on the dependent variable, T2D.","Anticipated Findings
The goal is to delineate health trends and disaggregate Asian American subgroups. We anticipate identifying health trends regarding the prevalence of T2D within Asian American subgroups. By identifying these trends, we hope to raise awareness of the prevalence of T2D within Asian American communities. There is currently a deficit in biomedical research regarding Asian Americans. This is especially concerning, as Asian Americans are on pace to be one of the fastest-growing racial groups in America. By identifying trends within the cohort, the results can be used to identify which groups are most susceptible to T2D, which will allow the development of better prevention strategies and optimal treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

According to the CDC, 90% of the nation's $3.5 trillion annual health care expenditures is spent on treating chronic and mental health conditions. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) provided by Registered Dietitians has been shown to be an effective and cost-effective component of treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, in small clinical studies and medical practices in hospitals. Thus, MNT could be an additional powerful medical treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. However, there is no known large-scale research that examines the effectiveness of MNT in the diseases. By leveraging the national-level data from All of Us, we hope to determine if MNT could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. If possible, we would also like to determine if specific nutrition interventions provided in MNT produce significantly better health outcomes compared to other nutrition interventions provided in MNT.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Diseases)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a prospective cohort study for individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndromes. Individuals with those diseases who have completed at least 1 MNT or no MNT will be included in the cohort. MNT is being provided by Registered Dietitians in hospitals and clinics, so data about MNT is available from the EHR. By following those individuals in the cohort over time, we will have their short-, middle-, and long-term health outcomes of the diseases. By comparing the health outcomes between individuals who completed MNT and individuals who did not, after adjusting potential confounders, we will determine if could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. Additionally, we will attempt to categorize different MNTs based on their specific nutrition interventions and determine if specific MNTs are more effective.","Anticipated Findings
The primary outcome of the study is the overall effectiveness of MNT on cardiometabolic diseases. The secondary outcome of the study is the effectiveness of specific MNTs on cardiometabolic diseases. Our finding might provide evidence that MNT is an effective treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, in addition to medications and medical surgeries. MNT provided by Registered Dietitians could be an essential part of a health care team that is responsible for treating cardiometabolic diseases, positively impacting patients' weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose control.  Additionally, since MNT is cost-effective, it could help save health care expenditures, which is beneficial to alleviate the financial burden of the diseases. Lastly, because MNT is an individualized nutrition treatment, our findings could contribute to the understanding of the effect of precision nutrition on human health, as one-size-fits-all nutritional approaches have not been very effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I plan to explore the All of Us program data to more fully develop a specific research question relating to the effects of physical activity/exercise training in individuals diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  Currently pharmacological strategies used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have not shown the same beneficial effects in individuals diagnosed with HFpEF.  Exercise has been shown to produce beneficial effects in many aspects of this very complex disease as well as in the co-morbidities frequently occurring with HFpEF (e.g. atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, etc.).

Early identification of patients with undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) or those at an increased risk of developing the disease is an important public health challenge. We aim to develop a predictive model for disease transitions in T2D. This will help us gain a more accurate understanding of the combination of factors that cause the disease, allowing us to more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients. Our research aims to 1) better understand T2D disease transition and progression, 2) more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients, 3) better understand the risk factors that lead to the development of the disease and their interactions, 4) identify currently unknown risk factors, 5) gain a better understanding of which types of interventions have the greatest chance of success for impacting disease transition, either by reducing the severity of the disease, delaying its onset, or preventing it altogether.","Project Purpose(s)

The results from our study could help patients in several ways. First, a predictive model might help to more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients and identify the most effective ways to prevent the condition from developing or worsening. Second, identifying relevant risk factors (both known and unknown), as well as their interactions, may help to deliver patient interventions earlier to reduce disease outcomes. This may also help doctors and patients target the factors that are most likely to reduce or eliminate disease transition, helping to provide the best clinical outcome for patients.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex common disease that disproportionately impacts minority ethnic and racial groups. Socioeconomic deprivation (SED) is widely considered to be a risk factor for T2D disparities. In 2021, the effect of genetic ancestry (GA) on such disparities was studied using data from the United Kingdom (UK) to reveal an interaction. The study found that both SED and non-European GA were significantly associated with the observed T2D disparities, with GA showing a stronger effect than SED in the overall population. GA and SED show significant interaction effects on T2D, with SED being a greater risk factor for T2D for individuals with South Asian and African ancestry, compared to those with European ancestry. This study underscored how the effects of environmental risk factors can differ among ancestry groups, suggesting the need for group-specific interventions.

1. Is idiopathic achalasia associated with other medical conditions that lead to microvascular damage (e.g. type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis etc.)?
Esophageal achalasia is an idiopathic, rare disorder characterized by degeneration of neurons of the myenteric plexus of the esophagus. Gastroparesis, which functionally resembles achalasia and affects diabetic patients, is hypothesized to occur due to nerve ischemia from microvascular damage secondary to diabetes. Studies on achalasia have been largely limited due to the rarity of the condition, but understanding whether a relationship exists between achalasia and disorders that cause vascular damage could help inform guidelines on preventive care given how common some of these conditions are in the U.S. population (e.g. type II diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, autoimmune conditions).","Project Purpose(s)

I plan on reviewing the data set and performing a case-control study. Patients will be included in the study  if  they are ≥ 18  years of age and have esophageal achalasia.  Patients will be matched by age, race, and sex. Then they will be compared to patients without diagnosed esophageal achalasia and compared on their prevalence of type II diabetes, type I diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, malignancy, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematous, and IBD. I will also perform a subanalysis by race for the risks given the limited data on achalasia and hypothesized HLA predispositions. Means will be compared between cohorts using a Student’s t-test. Proportions will be compared using the chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression will be performed to further examine specific conditions and  the results will be expressed using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. I will consider a p value of <0.05 significant for all findings.","Anticipated Findings
It is anticipated that most, if not all of these conditions leading to microvascular damage, will be represented to a greater extent in the achalasia group compared to the control group. Regardless, any information gathered would be very helpful in leading to a greater understanding of esophageal achalasia, which is poorly understood. Information on associations by race would also be very valuable as little data exists on the topic given the rarity of the condition.

Childhood obesity is a major public health problem across the globe as well as in the US. Childhood obesity can continue into adulthood and is known to be a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases . Preventing childhood obesity has been actively pursued in pediatric programs. However, decades of rigorous research have shown that prevention and management of obesity is not easy. This is partly due to our limited understating of obesity and the complex interactions among a myriad of various factors, including biological and environmental ones, that are known to contribute to obesity. The motivation of this work is to predict childhood obesity early on and study the cause and consequences of obesity.","Project Purpose(s)

Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Data will be drawn from EHR domains (diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, use of metformin, vitamin B 12 levels, vitamin B 12 supplementation), and survey responses (demographics, healthcare access and utilization). Basic descriptive statistics will be used to answer questions 1-3 above and inferential statistics to assess for disparities based on demographic factors, etc. (questions 4-6).","Anticipated Findings
This work will contribute to our understanding of how common vitamin B 12 deficiency is in patients who take metformin. Additionally, how likely it is patients taking metformin will be tested for deficiency and how likely it is that deficiency will be treated if present. Finally, this work aims to assess disparities, whether they be gender/sex-based, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic (e.g. educational attainment, income), age-based, or others, in the likelihood a patient taking metformin will have their vitamin B 12 levels assessed, whether they will have a deficiency and whether a deficiency will be treated if it is present.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Aevus is engineering a ML -powered Prescription Guidance Platform - Aevus Precision Rx for Endocrinologists/PCPs  to tailor prescriptions for Type 2 diabetes patients. In doing so, Aevus intends to improve T2D  drug outcomes, reduce medication switching and lower treatment costs. There are 11 drug classes used to treat T2D with over 100 different medications for a doctor to choose from prior to prescribing a treatment plan to a patient. The doctor is thus faced with a problem of plenty - On average, it takes an Endocrinologist/PCP 18-24 months to arrive at a stable drug compound and dosage of that compound to treat a T2D patient. A portion of the astronomical health care spending also goes into treating Adverse Drug Reactions, which are frequent and drain the health system of $3.5 B annually. Precision Rx will act as a real-time point-of-care clinical decision support tool that will interface as a software between the physician and the EHR.","Project Purpose(s)

Approach: 1) Initial data exploration through visualizations of variable distributions in relation to frequency among Diabetes Type 2 patients, as well as medications, 2) Statistical testing of variables for significance in regards to outcome that includes correlation, covariance, univariate linear regressions, univariate logistic regressions, multivariate linear and logistic regressions including lasso regularization, and Bayesian model averaging. 3) Evaluation and scaled significance of variable interactions from statistical testing in respect to the outcome,  4) First testing of prototype machine learning models and evaluation of models against a benchmark for performance, 5) Model selection narrowed to a narrow subset of machine learning algorithms, 6) Testing of combinations of top significant variables found during statistical exploration in the chosen model in order to determine the final set of input predictors, 7) Tuning of final prediction model.","Anticipated Findings
The goal of our modelling outcome is to generate a scale that will rank the 11 drug classes used to treat Type 2 Diabetes in decreasing order of potential toxicity to the patient. The above mentioned overarching ML model will comprise of several sub-ML models, the ensemble of which will produce an umbrella model that can rank all the drug classes. Each sub-model will tackle the question of 'Is drug class X suitable for unique patient XYZ or not?'. Precision Rx is intended to be a tool that can easily integrate into the existing clinical workflow of a physician with minimal change to their routine. There have been some advancements in the space of automated clinical decision support for Type 2 Diabetes in the past - tools like Epocrates have EHR integration capabilities that allow for physicians to make more accurate prescription decisions based purely off ADA guidelines. These are thus static tools that are not making use of EHR and Big Data Analysis to make a more data-driven decision","Demographic Categories of Interest

We want conduct an exhaustive cost-effectiveness analysis on all antihypertensive drugs across a variety of outcomes to be able to suggest modified prescription guidelines. Hypertension affects 30-45% of adults in the United States (depending on the definition of hypertension used) representing a significant economic burden on both individuals and society. However, there are many guidelines spanning different countries, associations, and organizations which often recommend multiple drug classes even in the case of another existing condition (e.g. type 2 diabetes). We want to use real world evidence to conduct cost effectiveness analysis to improve the existing guidelines.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the electronic health records (EHR) data as real world evidence to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis. Specifically, we will get the EHR of all individuals who have been diagnosed with hypertension and are first time users of antihypertensive monotherapies. We will then match the cohorts with propensity score matching and conduct cost-effectiveness analysis on all pairwise combinations of drugs with respect to a number of outcomes including: QALY and ICER.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that for most disease/secondary outcomes there is no major difference between different classes or active ingredients of antihypertensives especially for the short term outcome of 5 years. With our findings, we will be able to suggest changes to the existing hypertension prescription guidelines for different races, sexes, ages, preexisting diseases (e.g. chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.) which we hope will have a positive impact on healthcare.","Demographic Categories of Interest
