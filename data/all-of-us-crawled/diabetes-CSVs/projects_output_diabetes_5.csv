The extent to which genetic and non-genetic factors as a whole contribute to potential risk of CKD in adults is not well quantified. For example, while much literature exists on APOL1 risk alleles primarily in individuals of African ancestry, APOL1 appears to be most strongly associated with FSGS and HIV nephropathy rather than CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension, which account for a greater proportion of all kidney disease. Therefore, we intend to utilize an existing polygenic risk score (PRS) for CKD to see to what extent genetic or non-genetic factors contribute to differences in risk of CKD","Project Purpose(s)

In the All of Us dataset, demographics, self-reported medical history, EHR data for diagnoses and laboratory measures to identify CKD, and genotype array data to calculate the PRS. Descriptive statistics weighed to the national population for sociodemographic measures will be used to describe CKD prevalence and the undiagnosed proportion of cases. To gauge the contribution of socioeconomic, genetic, and non-genetic factors to CKD burden, logistic regression models can be used along with corresponding measures of fit such as changes between different models in area under the curve (AUC) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).","Anticipated Findings
CKD prevalence may differ by disaggregated race/ethnicity groups, as may the genetic and non-genetic contributions to CKD risk, which can shed light on the underlying causes of observed disparities by race/ethnicity groups in CKD burden, and what areas can be intervened upon to improve health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes caused by a single highly penetrant variant. A majority of MODY cases are caused by pathogenic variants in three genes: HNF1A, HNF4A and GCK. The prevalence and penetrance of pathogenic variants in MODY-associated genes is still relatively unclear. Proper identification and diagnosis of MODY is important as the condition has treatment implications differ from other forms of diabetes . For example, first line treatment for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY subtypes is sulfonylureas vs. insulin in type 1 or metformin in type 2. For GCK-MODY, pharmacologic treatment is unnecessary except in some cases. The goals of this project are two-fold. We are interested in better understanding the prevalence and penetrance of these variants in the AoU cohort. We are interested in understanding how well treatments prescribed match clinical guidelines indicated by genetic etiology for  those with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic MODY variant.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) )
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will identify individuals in the cohort with a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in one of the MODY-associated genes using classifications from the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel for Variation Curation, which is a group of physicians, geneticists, and laboratory pathologists that work on MODY.   From the eligible individuals, we will look at diagnosis of diabetes, age of diagnosis, family history of diabetes, and treatment information. We will be using methods for penetrance estimate based on previous work by Mirshahi et al. 2022 (PMID 36257325). Because of phenotypic and onset differences between HNF1A/HNF4A MODY and GCK MODY, we will use two separate methodologies to estimate penetrance. To estimate the penetrance of diabetes for those with a HNF1A or HNF4A variant, we will use Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. For those with a GCK variant, we will use Fisher’s exact test to estimate the penetrance for mild hyperglycemia.","Anticipated Findings
By gaining an estimate for the prevalence and penetrance of known MODY-associated variants, we will have a better understanding of how common these variants are in the population and how likely a variant will result in disease.   Although there has been previous work done in this area, it has been completed predominately in White-European cohorts  and, to our knowledge, not in a healthy US cohort. Through this project, we will be able to gain insights regarding MODY variants in diverse groups living in the United States. By analyzing treatments being used for MODY, we will be able to understand the current clinical landscape for MODY and identify potential areas of improvement. We hope that this work will lead to a better understanding of the presence of MODY-associated variants in the US and better improve health outcomes for individuals with this condition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between dental infections (as consequence of dental caries and pulp necrosis) and additional diseases (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) although limitations of such studies hamper conclusive interpretations . We showed that apical periodontitis (pulp necrosis with bone resorption) was strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease; further, we identified an association between an established hypertension-associated gene with apical periodontitis in a well-characterized population. These findings strongly indicate that a shared genetic etiology could contribute to oral health-systemic health relationships. By using All of Us data, we hope to validate our previous findings and expand knowledge of the etiology linking oral health and systemic health. We will identify additional factors (social determinants of health) that may play a role in the interconnectedness between oral health and general health.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Set of conditions - dental infections, diabetes and cardiovascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Data available via All of Us research workbench shows 20 dental infection conditions that reflect a continuum of dental infection (i.e., dental caries, pulpal and periapical conditions) of interest. We are interested to investigate if relationships exist between these dental infection conditions with type 2 diabetes, hypertensive disorder, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart murmur and cerebrovascular accident.
We will access demographic, clinical (dental and medical) and genetic data from individuals with the above conditions (no exclusions based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or genetic ancestry). We will test for association between a set of conditions, and will also identify potential genes/variants associated with a combined phenotype of dental infection + systemic condition using a variety of tools and statistical methods. All of Us data will allow us to identify a large sample of unrelated controls to increase confidence in the results.","Anticipated Findings
Much of the controversial findings in epidemiological and genetic association studies looking at oral/dental and systemic conditions is due to differences in populations studied, data ascertainment methodologies, but mainly due to limited sample sizes. This study will leverage high-quality demographic/clinical and genomic data of a large and diverse dataset that will allow the best (largest) evidence to date. It will also enable a robust model for use in future studies by other investigators.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will examine the transportability of findings from randomized trials about management of gestational diabetes as well as diabetes and glucose abnormalities during pregnancy in a nationally representative observational cohort. This project will also examine the utility of causal inference methods in examining such transportability. Transportability of findings from trials to observational cohorts is key to the advancement of effectiveness assessment in observational data. The latter source may be the only one available to studies where populations are small (e.g. rare diseases), difficult to reach, or in which trials induce an exceptional high risk (e.g. pregnancy) or would be unethical.","Project Purpose(s)

Unmodeled heterogeneity of the biological underpinnings of phenotypes reduces statistical power and reproducibility in downstream analyses such as genome-wide association studies. While some complex diseases have well-established clinically-relevant subtypes that respond differently to different treatments (e.g., diabetes and asthma), heterogeneity is suspected but has not so far been demonstrated for many other phenotypes. Existing data-driven subtyping methods primarily rely on data clustering methods that are not guaranteed to capture genetically- or clinically-relevant stratification of patients, thus, impeding our ability to take an important step towards personalized medicine by defining treatment at the subphenotypic level. The goal of this proposal is to enable a robust identification of clinically-relevant subphenotypic variation given no prior knowledge.","Project Purpose(s)

This study’s aim is the development of a contrastive learning method to define de novo phenotypic subtypes of complex disease based on electronic health records, and the application of the method to analyze the heterogeneity in clinical trajectories of conditions for which subphenotypic heterogeneity will be identified.","Anticipated Findings

Our goal is to examine differences in cardiovascular (CV) health between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM adults (ages 18 and over).

We will also explore potential racial, ethnic, education, income, and geographic location differences CV health within SGM individuals. This project is led by Dr. Billy Caceres who is a CV nurse scientist and a nationally recognized expert on the CV health of SGM individuals. There is growing evidence showing that SGM adults are at greater risk for CV disease than non-SGM individuals. However, potential reasons for these differences are not understood.

1. How do patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease compare to those without in the general population in relationship to platelet count?
2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)

As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It has been estimated that 10.2% of the global population will have diabetes by 2030.  PRS combined with non-genetic predictors potentially holds utility for identifying individuals at high risk prior to disease onset, motivating positive health behavior change or repeated screening for those at high risk, or even guiding therapeutic interventions. The All of Us Research Program is uniquely situated to address these questions and identify opportunities for tailoring prediction across multi-ancestry populations.
Our primary study question is to investigate whether a multi-ancestry T2D PRS will be associated with T2D-related phenotypic risk factors and complications across diverse populations. In particular, we hypothesize that the T2D PRS may help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. Our secondary study question will investigate whether the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D risk is mediated by T2D risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will construct a multi-ancestry T2D PRS based on a large multi-ancestry T2D GWAS meta-analysis. We will also construct a PRS based on a recent T2D GWAS meta-analysis that includes a larger number of non-European ancestry individuals. In addition, we will evaluate a genome-wide PRS using recent approaches such as LDPred2, PRS-CSx, and others.
For our primary study question, in analyses stratified by T2D status, we will evaluate the association between the T2D PRS and the T2D-related risk factors and complications using regression models. For our secondary study question, we will evaluate whether the T2D risk factors mediate the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D status. This will be performed using regression models to assess the relationship between 1) the PRS and T2D risk, 2) the PRS and the T2D risk factor, 3) the T2D risk factor and T2D risk, and 4) the PRS and T2D risk while adjusting for the T2D risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that our T2D PRS may hold prognostic value and help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. We anticipate that the effectiveness of T2D PRS is context-dependent. The T2D PRS may perform well in predicting T2D risk for diverse populations and may hold potential prognostic value for prediabetes and T2D controls.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures. The results will demonstrate whether COVID-19 infection increased economic, job, and health access disparities among Hispanic participants.","Project Purpose(s)

We will define a cohort on All of Us that includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants who self-report COVID-19 infection, have record of a positive PCR test for COVID-19, or have COVID-19 antigens. We will produce data visualization of key results and build logistic regression models predicting ethnicity build using the selected variables of COVID-19 infection and related social determinants of health.  Appropriate interactions will be included to produce a model with explanatory power and parsimonious fit.","Anticipated Findings
1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as type-2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease has dramatically increased in the last two generations. One source of rising prevalence has been argued to be decanalization, a special class of genotype-by-environment interactions to study the evolution of human wellness with respect to changing environment. The recent lifestyle and behavioral shifts such as sedentary nature, low physical activity or socioeconomic disparities lead to increase in genetic effects on the disease over time. Here we ask the question – how the rapid cultural shifts of the modern environment interact with polygenic risk and influence disease susceptibility.  We previously sought evidence of this process through a comparison of prevalence of phenotypes as a function of polygenic scores with respect to environments across complex traits and common diseases and aim to replicate our findings as well as extend the methods.","Project Purpose(s)

We will then quantify the deviations of risk at the extremes of polygenic scores to quantify the impact of disease in low- vs high-risk environment.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our findings will have implications in the implementation of polygenic risk assessment in precision medicine. Confirmed polygenic risk score-by-environmental interactions across common disease and complex traits will point towards high-risk environments impacting disease risk.

We intend to identify how many patients who report having prediabetes but not type 2 diabetes have evidence of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in their electronic medical record (EMR).

Disease Focused Research (prediabetes syndrome)","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional study, we will use information from the electronic medical record (EMR) and survey responses from adults (age 18+). We will query the EMR for hemoglobin A1c measurements (HbA1c), and EMR diagnoses of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The population will be stratified by diabetes status based on EMR data: no diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%), prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 6.4%). Additionally, we will evaluate factors that may moderate these relationships, including sex, race, ethnicity, healthcare access, and socioeconomic status. We will create contingency tables to describe relationships and construct linear regression models using R to incorporate these factors.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate there will be differences between self-report of prediabetes and evidence of dysglycemia in the EMR.

Type 2 diabetes is attached with many associated metabolic traits of obesity, inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperglycemia. These traits have been seen as well-known risk factors for breast cancer. One of the most prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs metformin has been utilized in many treatments in breast cancer patients during and prior to diagnosis. These associations provided a strong rationale to study the association of metformin use in clinical care of women with breast cancer, particularly due to the nature of insulin. In addition, changes derived from insulin resistance in patients with metformin use have been involved in tumor development, aggressiveness, treatment response, and poorer prognosis.

Assess the performance of a commonly used prediction model of diabetes complications in a more diverse population.
The risk engine from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) is built into the vast majority of clinical and economic decision models currently used in the US, despite considerable limitations: UKPDS began in 1977, is based on a cohort 5,100 British diabetics, and minority groups typical in US patient populations were not represented at all. In addition, relationships between predictors and health outcomes are likely to have changed over the past 40 years in which there were large changes in health risks as well as treatments. This workspace analyzes trajectories of diabetes complications for underrepresented groups and contrasts it to predictions from the UKPDS.","Project Purpose(s)

We will conduct a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of family history of common chronic diseases in diverse All of Us participants. We will also investigate the risk of various chronic diseases based on reporting a  family history of the same disease or other diseases. We will investigate factors associated with increased familial risks such as age of onset of disease, number of affected relatives and other covariates. Family history is considered one of the most important risk factors for health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and other chronic conditions.

The specific question we hope to answer is whether individuals with rosacea and a normal BMI have a higher prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) compared to individuals with a normal BMI. It has been previously discovered that individuals with a normal BMI have higher rates of T2DM compared to a population with a non-normal BMI. This question is important in the screening and hopeful prevention of T2DM.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Rosacea)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use a quantitative approach and create two datasets. One dataset will include individuals with a normal BMI that do and do not have rosacea. The second dataset will include individuals with a non-normal BMI that do and do not have rosacea. From this, we can describe summary statistics and also analyze through a t-test whether rosacea is significantly correlated with T2DM in individuals with T2DM.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study will be the determination of rosacea as a potential risk factor or association with T2DM in the general population. This would contribute to how individuals with a normal BMI and rosacea may be screened during an initial clinic visit and ultimately, hopefully, reduce the debilitating effects of advanced T2DM.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes remains an overwhelming public health burden in the United States with the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes reaching an estimated 8.7% of the adult population in 2019. Among patient with DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Importantly, the burden of disease is not shared equally across the population; racial and socioeconomic disparities are evident in recent DM data.
The goal of this project is to use the All of Us Research Program database to explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in composite CVD risk factor control amongDM patients with and without CVD. We want to know 1. Among patients with diabetes mellitus with and without CVD, what is the extent of composite risk factor control (BP, HbA1c, LDL-C, BMI, tobacco status, activity level? 2. How is race, ethnicity, sex, income, and healthcare access associated with number of risk factors at target for control?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Demographic data will be compared in patients with and without CVD using a survey t test for continuous variables or Chi-squared test for categorial variables. We will use a chi-squared test of proportions to compare the proportion of patients at target individual and composite risk factor control between patients with and without CVD. Multiple logistic regression will be used to identify if race, sex, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare are associated with individual and composite risk factor control.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that there are different patterns in terms of risk factor control across DM patients with and without CVD depending on social determinants of health, which will help to identify the possible prevention strategies for DM and CVD and address social determinants to improve health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Understanding the spectrum risks found in persons with diabetes and ASCVD in a contemporary cohort of US adults can help target the intensity of therapeutic approaches to prevent future adverse outcomes.
The project will examine the following questions:
1.	Within those with diabetes, how many are higher risk (two or more risk factors) and within those with ASCVD how many are at very high risk according to the recent 2018 cholesterol guidelines?
2.	Among these higher versus lower risk patients with ASCVD and DM, what is the adherence to non-smoking, healthy diet, and regular physical activity?
3.	Among these groups, what is the proportion at target for BP (<130/80 mmHg), LDL-C (< 70 mg/dl if CVD, <100 mg/dl otherwise), HbA1c (<8% if with CVD or <7% if not)?
4.	How does the extent of recommended medication use compare among these groups, including statins, BP medication, DM medication, antiplatelet/aspirin therapy, and influenza vaccination.","Project Purpose(s)

Despite elevated bone mineral density (BMD), people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at greater risk for fracture which is underestimated by current standard of care tools. Previous works in our group identified that poor glycemic control in T2D individuals was associated with an 29% increase of all fracture risk, and the use of anti-diabetic and anti-osteoporotic medications were associated with an increase or decrease of fracture risk. We would like to use an additional large medical database to verify the relationship between longitudinal HbA1c, medication use, and fracture risk.

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Insulin pump systems offer improved glycemic control and reduced morbidity and mortality in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In recent years, insulin pumps have increasingly been paired with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to automate insulin delivery and reduce user input. Significant barriers to diabetes technologies–including cost, access, and provider knowledge–limit uptake. Similar barriers also likely exist for the use of oral antihyperglycemic medications that require investigation of insulin resistance profiles in patients receiving care at specialized centers. The goal of this study is to identify socioeconomic disparities in T1DM management in a large national cohort. Specifically, we aim to (1) characterize insulin pump system use across race/ethnicity among patients in the United States, (2) characterize insulin pump complications among patients in the United States, and (3) characterize oral anti-hyperglycemic medicationn use in T1DM using the All of Us database.","Project Purpose(s)

Due to the far-reaching effects of metabolic dysregulation, the All of Us dataset makes it possible for us to examine PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on various phenotypes and disorders.
PAS Kinase (PASK) is a protein that responds to glucose availability and regulates glucose metabolism in yeast, mice, and humans. Metabolic issues contribute to diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Publications have shown a relationship between conditions such as those listed above and PASK. Our research aims to find genetic associations between PASK and two of its substrates with various disease phenotypes. We will accomplish this using data provided by the All of Us dataset, which includes lab measurements and whole genome sequencing. We will perform a linear regression analysis to find associations between PASK gene variants among diverse ancestries to find new trends and associations between various metabolic issues and phenotypical expression.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We propose to discover associations between USF1, ATXN2, and PASK to analyze their variation in conjunction with blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, blood count, lipid panels, and urinalysis using the All of Us dataset.
We will utilize the All of Us dataset to find associations between PASK, USF1, and ATXN2and their phenotypes in diverse ancestry groups. Regression analyses will present our findings.
Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) will look at common and rare variants found in the PASK, USF1, and ATXN2. Using diverse data, we can better indicate significant variations between these genes and make applicable findings for all people. Efforts to ensure ancestrally varying datasets improve contributions made in medicine to make progress towards personalized care. European, African, Asian, and Hispanic populations are all included in the All of Us dataset, which will guarantee more accurate associations made in our study.","Anticipated Findings
Our final goal will be to show associations between these three genes of interest with disease phenotypes. We expect to see significant phenotype-gene associations in various areas due to the central nature of lipid and respiratory metabolism and the role of their dysregulation in many diseases.   We will publish our findings in a peer-reviewed article which will be part of a more extensive publication. The publication will include information from the genome-wide association study described in this proposal. It will also include data collected from a phenome-wide association study, identifying associated disease phenotypes for PASK, USF1, and ATXN2. Next fall, I will present the data as a poster at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG).

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented.

I want to understand how we decide what type of health care to get and when. My premise is that we seek care that has value to us... meaning achieving a desired outcome at an acceptable cost but value for an individual may differ from value for a health system.
Aim 1 :  Determine predictors for utilizing health care resources and determine if use of different resources leads to differential health outcomes
For example, does using Urgent Care versus Primary care affect health outcomes for individuals with different health backgrounds?
Aim 2 : Recreate nationally used quality metrics for the All of Us population and determine benchmarks for these measures.
A simple example would be patients with diabetes whose hemoglobin A1C is higher than a standard.
Aim 3 : Using the recreated metrics, determine predictors of ""success"" and identify potential areas where value to an individual conflicts with value to a physician or health care system or insurer.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Aim 1  : Pull out data applicable to patient's stated preference for health care and compare it to the actual visit codes. Correlate visit codes in different settings to diagnoses, social determinants of health, and, notably, to health outcomes.
Aim 2 :  Using the EHR and self report data bases, recreate quality metrics used for ratings and quality payment methodologies. Establish national and regional benchmarks for these measures and explore variations by SDOH, diagnoses, comorbidities.
Aim 3 : Take the quality metrics data created in Aim 2 and determine the value proposition for these metrics for individuals versus institutions by comparing outcomes versus approximate health care costs (annualized)","Anticipated Findings
Many of the quality and value based care metrics used by insurers and health care systems have not been examined nationally to establish benchmarks.
Further, the underlying assumptions of many metrics has not included the patient's perspective on the value to them.
Identifying both benchmarks and the discrepancies in perception of value in health care  will enable the development of systems that connect patients to excellent health care that meets both their goals and the health systems goals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Is covid-19 and its relationship to diabetes in Hispanic/Latino communities different among different genders, geographical areas or wealth brackets?
Is there reverse causality between Ethnicity and Diabetes and Covid-19?
Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect resulting in more than 6 million deaths.  It has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy.
Type 2 diabetes is an expanding global health problem. Individuals with T2DM are at high risk for both microvascular complications and macrovascular complications owing to hyperglycaemia and individual components of the insulin resistance syndrome.
Recent literature suggested that the rate of T2Dm are unusually high in specifically Hispanic/Latino populations with Covid-19.  What are the underlying reasons?","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Initially part of an AILA challenge.  )","Scientific Approaches
We will initially use the NIH dataset for the challenge.  We will do a power analysis for hispanic/latino populations and perhaps turn the paneled data into longitudinal data.  We will join the data on subject and look for what combination of useful independent variables give enough power for both covid-19 and diabetes in hispanic populations.  We may then conflate the fitbit data into means and variance per day of certain readings and also look at specific  .  We may do some initial exploratory analysis on the social determinants with pearson correlations between hispanic/latino and caucasian with both covid-19 and t2dm.  PCA and  TSNE as well.  We can then try fitting a neural network with attention and saliency maps on both stages and/or trying an instrumental variable regression.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to see a relationship between doctor prescription of diabetic medication and income in hispanic populations.  There is sometimes a large amount of prescriptions in EHR data (usable) that go un-used due to income issues.

What is the change in incidence of type 1 diabetes and/or autoimmune diseases before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? This question is significance because it can provide more correlative data to the association between viral infection and autoimmune development.
Are autoimmune diseases more prevalent in lower socioeconomic areas? This allows for more awareness if there is a stark difference based on zip code and can help focus campaigns targeted at lowering these rates.
Do COVID-19 hotspots/epicenters have higher rates of autoimmune disorders?
What is the distribution of autoimmune diseases across the country?","Project Purpose(s)

Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)","Scientific Approaches
I am looking to create heat maps for most of these questions especially the last one to see the distribution of autoimmune diseases and if they are related to lower economic status. In addition, I plan to use some statistics to see if there is a significant difference between the incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes before and after the pandemic. The tools within all of us database and outside readings will help me answer my research questions to know if there is an area to focus on following my wet lab research like my own community in Arizona. In addition, it will provide the foundation for my further research to know more as the relationship between viral infection and autoimmunity.","Anticipated Findings
I am anticipating that I will find a correlation between major COVID hotspots and rises in autoimmune diagnoses as well as lower socioeconomic zip codes having higher rates. Some of the supplemental questions contribute to these two overarching ideas and specify some details for them. However, the main idea is to see relationship between type 1 diabetes, autoimmunity, socioeconomic status, and viral infection. These notions will help the scientific community better understand autoimmune diseases and let public health know where to focus efforts.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic variants associated with complex diseases. Most GWAS have been developed within European ancestries and have shown to perform poorly in other race/ethnic groups, exaggerating health disparities across ancestries.
Scientific aim 1: Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for the discovery of genetic variants associated with several forms of diabetes.
Scientific aim 2: Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries.
Scientific aim 3: Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Project Purpose(s)

We will integrate GWAS data from other large-scale genetic studies with the ALLofUs data in order to:
1- Maximize the discovery of ancestry-specific genetic variants associated with a variety of forms of diabetes and complications. We will use a variety of genetic association tools, including Regenie, for GWAS analysis, METAL, for meta-analysis of results across ancestries, Finemap and Susie, and COJO to identify distinct signals.
2- Develop PRSs for diverse ancestries. We will use PRS-CS, PRS-CSx and other methods to develop and test PRSs for all ancestries.
3- We will functionally annotate genetic variants using publicly available data like the Roadmap Epigenomics browser, FANTOM, VEP, GNOMAD, etc …","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that that results of this study will, in part, address health disparities in several ways:
1- We will improve PRSs for all ancestries so that they can be useful for all individuals if applied clinically.
2- We will identify potential drug targets, including some drug targets that can only be identified when analyzing specific ancestries.
3- We will discover novel variants or genes that will help better understand the biology of diabetes and related traits.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Determine the association of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the screening patterns of GDM.
Increasing the effectiveness of healthcare by improving patient experience, outcomes, overall population health, and reducing healthcare costs is at the heart of U.S. healthcare quality improvement (Berwick, D. M, et al 2017). Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity continue to pose significant problems in healthcare for non-Hispanic black Americans. Billions of dollars are spent each year on medical resources and lost productivity. However, GDM is not well studied to mitigate its contribution to the increase of T2DM. For instance, the global burden of disease only includes GDM within “other maternal disorders” (Other maternal disorders - level 2 cause 2020). With the increase in minority and older populations, it is necessary to identify the optimal screening method for GDM by addressing upstream social determinants of health that prevent screening for GDM.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Educational","Scientific Approaches
We will conduct a binary logistic regression analysis to assess if the independent variables – patients' demographic and socioeconomic predict the dependent variable – when GDM was screened (Normal – 0 and Early – 1). Binary logistic regression is used for studies where the dependent variable is a categorical variable with a dichotomous outcome (Pituch and Stevens, 2015).
The reference category will be Normal (GDM screening between 24th to 28th weeks of gestation). The analysis will be done at the individual level. Odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value will be presented for the outcome variable. The analysis will be done with SAS Student edition software.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that there will be a difference in how women screen for GDM between race/ethnic groups as well as between socioeconomic groups. By identifying how upstream factors (Social determinants of health) impact population health, we might be able to propose strategies that are both cost-saving and effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1- What are the main prescribed medication sequences that participants  with  type 2 diabetes and depression took over three years of treatment?
In this questions, we are extracting the anti-diabetes and anti-depressant medications used to to treated participants who have T2D and depression codes. We retrieved medications prescribed after the first diagnosis code for each disease. We represented the medications using their ATC 4th level.
2- What is the most common first anti-diabetic and anti-depressant that were prescribed for All of Us participants? We extracted the first medications prescribed to treat T2D and depression. We identified the most common first medication with the highest number of participants.
3- Is there a change in the percentages of participants who were prescribed first common medication, treated using one medication, treated only using one common medication between 2000-2018?","Project Purpose(s)

Other Purpose (This work is a result of an All of Us Research Program Demonstration Project. The projects are efforts by the Program designed to meet the program's goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. This work was reviewed and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and the Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use.)","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we plan on using the medication sequencing developed at Columbia University and the OHDSI network as a means to characterize treatment pathways at scale. Further, we want to demonstrate implementation of these medication sequencing algorithms in the All of Us research dataset to show how the various sources of data contained within the program can be used to characterize treatment pathways at scale. We will perform separate medication sequence analyses for three different common, complex diseases: type 2 diabetes, depression
1- Data manipulation
Using python and BigQuery to:
A- Retrieve medication and their classes
B-Create the medications sequences
2- Visualization:
A- Creating sunburst to visualize the sequences
B- Plotting the percentages of participants the first common medication and one medication during three years","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity of the data by showing expected treatment patterns despite gathering data from over 30 individual EHR sites. Specifically, we expect to find:
1- Variation in the medication sequences prescribed to treat All of Us participants who had type 2 diabetes and depression.
2- The most common medication used to treat participants as first line treatment with type 2 diabetes and depression diagnosis.
3- A trend or change over time of prescribing the first common medication over the study period
4- Trend overtime for the percentage of participants
Importantly, the detailed code developed herein is made available within the Researcher Workbench to researchers, so that they may more easily extract medication data and class information using a common medication ontology, an approach useful in many discovery studies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (substance use disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will examine the relationship between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and CRP by regressing CRP on the cannabis use measures in the All of Us dataset. All models will control for covariates including age, sex, race and BMI. We may construct additional models that covary for comorbid conditions such as depression or asthma. Additionally, we will examine demographic counts for the variables of interest in our study.","Anticipated Findings
We would anticipate to find an association between cannabis use and CRP levels, with cannabis use in the last three months being associated with lower CRP levels. On the other hand, we would expect to find that cannabis use disorder (or some other measure of heavy use) is associated with higher CRP levels. This project could help untangle how the relationship between cannabis use and CRP changes according to level of cannabis use. It may also give insight into whether this relationship is confounded by other conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The plan is to analyze the SNPs using PLINK on the All of Us researcher workbench.  Next step is to make sure Beagle is installed.  Once Beagle is installed, SNP2HLA must be installed.  With SNP2HLA, the HLA haplotypes of each de-identified individual in the All of Us cohort will be determined.
The age of each All of Us participant at the time of sample collection must also be associated with each subject in the dataset.
With these data in .csv format, the aggregate number of each haplotype will be determined within each age group.   These data will then be analyzed use R tools on the workbench.
Other factors involved in the analysis is the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in the population as well as race, sex, and geography.","Anticipated Findings
Using the large population of All of Us participants, we expect to learn the extent to which high risk alleles for type 1 diabetes have increased over time.

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In order to understand the relationship of platelets and how abnormal counts can affect or lead to patients with diseases and disorders, we will be looking for relationships in various problems including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
Questions to be researched are as follows:
1. How do patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease compare to those without in the general population in relationship to platelet count?
2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes are leading causes of significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is widely known that physical activity may have a protective effect on development of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Per the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, It is currently recommended that pregnant women get at-least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for its benefits. However, there have been no studies that have used strictly recorded real-time data (i.e Fitbit device) on  physical activity to show the exact amount of exercise needed to have benefit to decrease maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes )
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Fitbit data for pregnant women that developed pre-eclampsia and/or gestational diabetes will be compared to those who did not develop pre-eclampsia and/or gestational diabetes to assess if there were significant differences in daily physical activity.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings may be that healthy pregnant patients that were more physically active are less likely to develop pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. The findings from this study will help give parameters for how much physical activity gives benefit to decrease risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes and associated maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It’s estimated 5 million of the 18 million americans in the US with diabetes do not know they have it. Early diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes is important so that patients can begin to manage the disease early and potentially prevent or delay the serious disease complications that can decrease quality of life. Some of these complications include premature heart disease and stroke, blindness, limb amputations, and kidney failure. Our project will review clinical data to estimate each patient’s diabetes risk, which will help identify high risk individuals who may need to seek medical attention.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Given the importance of being able to correctly give early diagnosis, this team places a stronger importance for our model on predictive performance, which leads the team to initially lean towards using random forest or boosting (particularly XGBoost) models.  These more complex models might not be as interpretable, and take longer to run, but they generally yield a much higher out-of-sample performance, which is the main goal of this team’s project.  The team will also look into how well a CART model performs with the dataset given that a CART tree, if it is not too complex, would offer that interpretability for the end users of this research project.  It is important to note that a CART model would be used in lieu of a more complex model if it performs on par with the more complex models.","Anticipated Findings
The overall goal of the project is to assist doctors with treating patients. Ideally, the data analysis would provide doctors with a model of what age range a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on his/her risk factors. If we can provide doctors with this information, then they can have a conversation with patients about preventative care, such as lifestyle changes, in advance of that age to try to prevent patients from developing diabetes. It also allows doctors to know when to start testing patients’ A1C levels to diagnose diabetes so the disease can be treated as quickly as possible. This prevents the untreated disease from wreaking havoc on the patients’ bodies, preventing complications from diabetes down the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Other Purpose (This work is a result of an All of Us Research Program Demonstration Project. The projects are efforts by the Program designed to meet the program's goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. This work was reviewed and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and the Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use.)","Scientific Approaches
We will select all All of Us participants who self-reported sex at birth male or female, whose self-reported race was white, black or Asian, as well as those who self-reported being Hispanics.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) will be identified from self-reports in the medical survey or from electronic health records (EHR).
Clinical factors will be identified from EHR and study measurements (blood pressure, weight, height).
We will evaluate the association of demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and clinical (body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, cardiovascular diseases) factors with prevalence of self-reported AF and prevalence of AF in the EHR, as well as incident AF ascertained from the EHR.","Anticipated Findings
The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), overall and by race/ethnicity, as well as to confirm the association of established risk factors for AF in the All of Us Research participants. We expect to confirm associations between demographic and clinical variables previously reported in the literature, demonstrating the value of the All of Us Research Program data to address questions regarding this common cardiovascular disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest
