Previous genetic studies have successfully identified >240 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many of the identified loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome, masking the underlying “effector gene”. Additionally, these studies were primarily performed in individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. As genetic findings are integrated into the clinic, this limited genetic understanding threatens to exacerbate existing health disparities among non-European communities disproportionately suffering from T2D and T2D-related health complications. Expanding our genetic understanding into non-European ancestries is essential as these studies will mitigate such health disparities and improve our ability to identify causal loci and mechanisms. In this study, I will leverage the diversity found within All of Us to perform a trans-ancestry genetic analysis of T2D, identifying likely causal variants and evaluating their potential for clinical utility.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Using well-established techniques in statistical genetics, I will (1) conduct a genome wide association study of common variants, as well as other forms of genetic variation (e.g., rare variants, copy number variations), to identify trans-ancestry and ancestry-specific disease-associated loci, (2) use statistical and functional fine-mapping techniques to identify the likely causal variants at disease-associated loci, validating my findings with experimental approaches, and (3) evaluate the clinical utility of my findings through polygenic scores (PGSs) and screening for potential targets of drug repurposing. For these analyses, I will use all participants with genetic data (whole genome and SNP-array). I will develop a phenotypic algorithm to classify participants into T2D cases and controls based on previously published work in electronic health records.","Anticipated Findings
Genetic studies of T2D have already provided valuable insight into disease pathophysiology. However, the vast majority of these studies have been performed in European and East Asian ancestries, threatening to exacerbate existing health disparities in populations carrying a disproportionate disease burden as genetics enters the clinic through preventative and therapeutic interventions. In the present study, I aim to address these shortcomings by leveraging the diversity found within All of Us to expand our genetic understanding of T2D. Based on the prior success of similar studies, I expect to identify many rare and common T2D-associated loci that are shared across ancestries as well as ancestry-specific. Combined with experimental and computational approaches, I will use these results to identify variants that are likely causal for T2D, propose the mechanism by which these variants contribute to T2D risk, and propose ways to translate my findings into clinical intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Metabolic diseases are a global epidemic. They occur when cells allocate too many of their primary resources towards one pathway, such as lipid production, at the expense of other crucial pathways, such as energy production. Understanding how cells control the pivotal point of allocating glucose towards lipid or energy production is key to developing effective treatments for these and other common metabolic diseases. PAS kinase (PASK) is a nutrient sensing protein kinase that regulates this critical metabolic node of lipid versus respiratory metabolism. PASK controls many of the hallmark pathways associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative disease yet little is known about PASK alleles associated with human disease. Herein we propose to conduct the first large-scale analysis to identify PASK alleles associated with human disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Analyze common and rare variants in USF1, ATXN2, and PASK compared to triglycerides, weight, cardiovascular measures, exercise levels and COVID-19 results.
Perform a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with common and rare variants in USF1, ATXN2, and PASK. Common variants in each of these three genes will be regressed against phenotypes from electronic health record data.","Anticipated Findings
We target PASK as well as two of its substrates for our study.  Due to their regulation of the critical node of glucose partitioning to lipid versus respiratory metabolism, we propose to uncover the influence of PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on a variety of human phenotypes and classes of disease, from hyperlipidemia and diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders using the All of Us dataset.
In addition to the wide variety of phenotypic data that will aid in understanding the influence of variation in cellular respiration and triglyceride levels, the ancestral diversity represented by the individuals in the dataset will allow us to identify patterns and variants that differ or are similar across ancestry, defining effects common to humankind while opening further studies on multigene, secondary variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are estimating cumulative incidence of common disaeases (heart disease, diabetes, asthma) across polygenic score strata after appropriately modelling for age and sex. This has been done in European populations and we are validating the method on diverse ancestries. We will use broad geographic categories for ancestry as used by the 1000 Genomes Project (East Asian, South Asian, African, Hispanic, European).

This is a first step in providing patients with absolute rather than relative risks when polygenic scores are implemented in the clinic.","Project Purpose(s)

In our cross-sectional study targeting adults aged 18-65, we will employ a combination of surveys, medical records analysis, and interviews to investigate the relationship between income levels, diabetes, and obesity. Utilizing random sampling, we aim for a representative sample. Key independent variables include income, education, and occupation, while dependent variables encompass BMI and the presence of diabetes. Data will be analyzed using statistical methods, including inferential statistics and subgroup analysis. Geospatial tools will aid in exploring regional variations, and ethical considerations will be prioritized. This mixed-methods approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing health outcomes. Rigorous procedures will be implemented to ensure data validity and reliability.","Anticipated Findings

Additionally, the roles of education and occupation are expected to be crucial, acting as intermediary factors influencing overall health outcomes. Disparities in healthcare access are likely to emerge, particularly affecting lower-income groups and potentially hindering timely preventive care and early interventions. Regional variations in diabetes and obesity rates, tied to income disparities, are anticipated, highlighting potential geographical hotspots that may require targeted public health interventions.

The primary scientific inquiry we aim to investigate revolves around ascertaining whether the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents yields additional cardiovascular benefits in comparison to the inhibition of either target in isolation, particularly in high-risk patients.
This research question holds significant importance as prevailing guidelines advocate for a more intensive management approach for type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. However, a substantial number of these patients struggle to attain the recommended treatment targets, even with maximal therapy. By examining the combined effects on blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation through the inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents , as demonstrated in this study, we intend to establish a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of a combined inhibitor approach.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes and CVD)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Dataset:
Utilize individual-level data from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD. Identify those at high risk who fail to achieve target blood glucose levels despite being on the maximum tolerated therapy for blood glucose reduction.
Methods:
Stratify participants based on genetic variants that are predictive of higher or lower levels. Subsequently, compare the rates of blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular events.
Analyses:
Utilize linear regression models to quantify the differences in blood glucose levels based on specific genotypes. Additionally, employ Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with different genotypes.
Test for interactions between genetic variants and the treatment effects of inhibitors on both blood glucose levels and clinical events.","Anticipated Findings
If genetic proxies confirm greater blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular benefit from blood glucose lowering variants, it would provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting combined pharmacological as a novel strategy for incremental risk reduction in high-risk patients, not at blood glucose goal. This would genetically validate the approach and inform the design of an outcomes trial directly comparing dual inhibition to individual inhibition alone","Demographic Categories of Interest

All prevalent human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s or diabetes, are known to be driven by a complex combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Numerous genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of genetic variants to common diseases. By design, GWAS
only find associations with a disease but cannot reveal which genetic variants are causal within
associated regions of the genome.  Current “fine mapping” algorithms, which aim to
pinpoint the truly causal variants, fail if there are too many variants that are inherited together, which is
often the case. This project will develop a new fine mapping method that uses GWAS data to identify
combinations of genetic variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The new method is based on a mathematical approximation that makes it much faster than existing
algorithms. This speed advantage allows the method to exhaustively explore the large number of
possible combinations of variants and identify those that have a high probability of being causal. In this
project, the new method will be thoroughly benchmarked against state-of-the art methods on simulated
data, for which the ground truth is known. The method will also be extended to consider additional
information about the human genome, such as the position of genes or molecular characteristics that
control the expression of genes.","Anticipated Findings

Drug use is controversial, especially when it involves illicit substances. Research shows that people who use drugs (PWUD) often face discrimination and stigma in healthcare settings, which results in them leaving against medical advice, or not returning despite needing critical medical attention.
I will be looking at the data from participants who identify as having a substance use disorder (SUD) and their experiences in healthcare settings. One question that will be looked at is: How often were you treated with respect by your doctors or health care provdiers?
Despite SUD being a medical diagnosis, I want to investigate how patients with this diagnosis are treated differently than those with other medical diagnoses such as diabetes or osteoarthritis.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
I will be utilizing the All of Us Research Workbench and qualitative data looking at survey results from patients regarding their experiences in healthcare settings.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that PWUD perceive lower levels of respect from healthcare professionals as compared to patients with other medical diagnoses and no history of SUD. These findings will help emphasize the stigma and bias that exists in medicine, so that we can encourage practitioners to unlearn the harmful and inaccurate narratives surrounding SUD, perpetuated by the racist war on drugs. By doing this, we can become better listeners, healers, and advocates.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Investigating the Influence of Specific Genomic Markers on the Development and Progression of Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-dimensional Analysis Using the All of Us Database.
Type 2 diabetes is a complex and multifactorial disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The All of Us database provides a unique opportunity to delve into the intricate interplay between specific genomic markers, lifestyle factors, and the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. This study aims to unravel the genetic determinants associated with type 2 diabetes within a diverse population, incorporating genomic, survey, wearable, and electronic health record (EHR) data. Identify and analyze specific genomic markers associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes using genomic data from the All of Us database. Explore the prevalence and distribution of these markers across different ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Cognitive impairment (CI) is a growing sequela of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Some data suggest that these GLDs may have cognitive benefits, however, comparisons across drug classes are scarce. We intended to investigate the associations between newer GLD and CI among adults with T2D.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Adults with diagnosed or self-reported T2D will be identified from the dataset. We used medication codes to identify the person’s GLD use. We will study three groups: (1) adults filling Metformin plus DPP4, (2) adults filling Metformin plus SGLT2i, and (3) adults filling Metformin plus GLP-1RA. CI was measured using ICD code or survey from EHR. The three groups were matched with a 1:1 multigroup propensity score algorithm based on age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities (e.g., obesity, and cardiovascular disease). Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to compare the associations between newer GLD use and CI, further adjusting for residual unbalanced covariates after matching.","Anticipated Findings
There are three categories of glucose-lowering drugs, which include GLP1-RA, DPP4, and SGLT2i. The study may show that one of these categories is associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment compared to the other two categories. For patients with type 2 diabetes who have experienced a decline in cognitive function, clinicians may consider prescribing drugs from this particular category to help slow down the rate of cognitive decline.","Demographic Categories of Interest

HbA1c is a clinical measure used to assess glycemic control over time. However some genetic variants may interfere with the accuracy of HbA1c as a measure of glycemic control. This could have negative implications for management of patients with diabetes/prediabetes and lead to an increased risk of complications. This is particularly an issue for individuals with ancestry from malaria endemic regions, whose genomes may contain high impact variants in genes such as G6PD and HBB (i.e. sickle cell trait) that have been under selective pressure from malaria in the past and may now be interfering with accurate clinical use of the HbA1c measure. Our goal for this study is to characterize whether variants in G6PD and HBB impact the rate of diabetes related complications, likely due to impacts on HbA1c measurement accuracy.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
- Datasets: those with type 1 or 2 diabetes and WGS
- Sickle Cell status rs334(A;T) - yes or no

Hypothesis 1: Individuals with diabetes and with known G6PD coding variants, particularly hemizygous males or homozygous females, will have a higher rate of diabetic retinopathy.
Cox proportional hazards models:
1. outcome~age+ sex + G6PD variant count+ sickle cell trait status + 10 principal components of genetic ancestry
2. + BMI
Hypothesis 2: In individuals with diabetes, HbA1c will be more predictive of retinopathy when adjusted for G6PD coding variant status. All models should be stratified by diabetes status (any diabetes, including either type 1 or type 2) at beginning of follow-up.

Hundreds of genetic variants have been linked with diabetes and related metabolic conditions, including for obesity, type-two diabetes, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin).. However, the biological pathways by which they act is not yet clear, nor have all causal genetic variants been identified, especially those in the fewest individuals. We intend to run genome-wide association studies between these phenotypes (e.g. individuals who suffer from diabetes versus those who do not, or BMI as a continuous trait), and other diabetes-related phenotypes (HbA1c, glucose etc) against genetic variants from the Whole Genome Sequencing data. Our results will improve the field’s understanding of the biological pathways for these conditions. The All of Us data set is crucial for answering these questions, due to its diverse genetic ancestry. Whole genome sequencing contains nearly all genetic variants, down to the rarest (<1% of individuals), which aids our ability to identify causal genetic mutations.","Project Purpose(s)

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also commonly referred to as 'Long COVID', involves a range of symptoms that continue for weeks to months after the initial recovery from a COVID-19 infection. The risk factors for developing PASC include severe initial COVID-19 symptoms, age, and pre-existing health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, immune system responses and genetic factors might influence susceptibility. The purpose of this research project is to test for any relationship between genetic predisposition for diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and and heart disease and risk for PASC. If any associations are identified, we will try to identify immune system characteristics that may link the genetic predisposition with risk for PASC. Hypotheses generated through this research will be validated in the NIH-funded RECOVER cohort established for the study of PASC.","Project Purpose(s)

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Aging-Related Diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians. The Li Lab here at UC Irvine uses a variety of computational methods to find different types of genomic patterns in an unbiased manner. With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging.

A previous genetic study found 5 genetic variants for PA, but replication is needed with the addition of other populations to understand how genetic diversity contributes to PA etiology. With a larger sample size, and more diverse sample, we will be able to find more genetic causal variants that contribute to pernicious anemia and if there is variation of etiology in different ancestral populations. Comparing the genetics of multiple autoimmune diseases can help find genetic variants that are specific to PA.","Project Purpose(s)

This workbench aims to validate the study of Abegaz et al. (https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/8/1138) and to uncover fairness in the way in which the model predicts on certain patients. This entails measuring the difference in AUC and statistical parity between different genders and ethnicies.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)

The first part of the study will be on constructing a classification model to automatically predict if a person has diabetes. There exist many such models for this like random forrest models, gradient boosted trees, artificial neural networks and simple logistic regression. The notebook will examine ways to mitigate the effects of being underrepresented in the dataset using method like Random Over Sampling and Interpolated Over Sampling (like SMOTE).","Anticipated Findings
The study expects to find classification models to predict most correctly on well represented groups within the All of Us Dataset. If there is a significant disparity of model fairness between genders or ethnicities  then this would call for more validation studies of other papers which do not examine fairness on protected features.
Decision trees, convolutional neural networks, and encoder decoder networks can be used to find latent feature representations of the highly dimensional datasets. These methods are useful in finding important features used in the prediction process, and can be used to see the importance of sensitive variables like race and gender in classification. We can also stratify the dataset by race and gender and see if certain features are important for some groups but not for others.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), but the metabolic benefits of PA vary across individuals. While many factors could modify the PA-T2D association, this project seeks to understand the role that genetics plays, by studying gene by PA interactions on the risk of T2D.  Specifically, the project will address two questions:
Question 1: Is there evidence for gene by PA interaction on T2D risk?
Question 2: If gene by PA interaction on T2D risk  exists, what is the biology driving this interaction?
These two questions are important and relevant. While knowing genetic factors that set people apart enables precision health, understanding the biology driving the separation lays the ground work for design interactions that harness the full metabolic benefits of PA.","Project Purpose(s)

Diabetes is a polygenic disease, and a multitude of factors contribute to the development of diabetes, including obesity and the built environment.
In this proposal, we will investigate the built environment, demographic, and social exposome factors that contribute to T2D using the All of Us diverse population database, including neighborhood walkability, parks and recreation, access to food, obesity, meal preparation, access to transportation, race and ethnicity, age, zip code, and access to health care (Aim 1). We will address the possible mechanistic insights into nutrient-sensing mechanisms that may contribute to the development of diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases (Aim 2).","Project Purpose(s)

Aim 1: We will study the data from participants with Type 2 diabetes and compare it to data from participants without type 2 diabetes from All of Us.

We will investigate factors that contribute to diabetes at the population level, such as the built environment, including neighborhood walkability, parks and recreation, access to food, obesity, meal preparation, access to transportation, race and ethnicity, age, zip code, and access to health care. Descriptive statistics will be calculated. Multivariable analysis, risk ratio, and regression models will be applied to assess the risk associations.
Aim 2: We will use the subset of data from All of Us participants with or without Type 2 Diabetes with available whole genome sequences to identify nutrient-sensing mTOR variants in both males and females across all ethnicities. First, we will identify population-level genetic variations in mTOR proteins.","Anticipated Findings
Aim 1: Findings from these studies will identify the food access, built environment, and access social, demographic, and environmental factors that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus provide rational and justifications for public health policy changes for harm reduction from the build environment exposure on the development of type 2 diabetes.
Aim 2: We expect to verify whether there are mTOR-specific variants that could be used as predictive of type 2 diabetes or hold the promise of mapping out a favorable response to treatment. The findings might help identify mTOR variants that are either protective or elevated risk for the development of diabetes.
Collectively, data from this work will provide an understanding of the contributors of the exposome that lead to the development of type 2 diabetes and increased cardiometabolic risk, which could be utilized clinically to map out personalized precision-medicine plans.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.

It has been estimated that 10.2% of the global population will have diabetes by 2030.

Our primary study question is to investigate whether a multi-ancestry T2D PRS will be associated with T2D-related phenotypic risk factors and complications across diverse populations. In particular, we hypothesize that the T2D PRS may help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications.

For our secondary study question, we will evaluate whether the T2D risk factors mediate the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D status. This will be performed using regression models to assess the relationship between 1) the PRS and T2D risk, 2) the PRS and the T2D risk factor, 3) the T2D risk factor and T2D risk, and 4) the PRS and T2D risk while adjusting for the T2D risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that our T2D PRS may hold prognostic value and help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. We anticipate that the effectiveness of T2D PRS is context-dependent. The T2D PRS may perform well in predicting T2D risk for diverse populations and may hold potential prognostic value for prediabetes and T2D controls.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How do longitudinal activity measures, as captured by wearable technology like Fitbit, influence the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with diabetes?
Physical activity is a known modifiable risk factor in the management of diabetes. However, its specific impact on the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy is less clear. Given the global prevalence of diabetes and its complications, understanding how lifestyle factors like physical activity influence the risk of diabetic retinopathy is crucial for developing targeted prevention strategies.
This study could advance our understanding of how to effectively utilize such technology in chronic disease management and prevention. If a significant association is found, it could lead to more personalized health recommendations for individuals with diabetes, potentially integrating wearable technology into routine care to monitor and encourage physical activity.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
All of Us Research Program: Utilize the program’s comprehensive dataset, focusing on individuals with diabetes. The dataset will provide:
Physical Activity Data: Extracted from Fitbit devices, including daily step counts, exercise intensity, and duration.
Diabetic Retinopathy Data: Sourced from electronic health records, detailing the onset, progression, and severity of diabetic retinopathy.
Covariates: Demographic information, diabetes-related metrics (e.g., duration of diabetes, glycemic control), and other health factors.
Retrospective Cohort Study Design: Analyze existing longitudinal data to assess the relationship between physical activity and the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.
Descriptive Statistics: To summarize participant characteristics and activity patterns.
Regression Analysis: Employ logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between activity levels and diabetic retinopathy risk, adjusting for potential confounders","Anticipated Findings
Physical Activity's Impact: Expect to identify specific activity patterns that correlate with reduced diabetic retinopathy risk in diabetics.
Risk Quantification: Aim to quantify how much physical activity mitigates this risk, potentially finding beneficial activity thresholds.
Subgroup Variations: The study may reveal differences in activity-retinopathy associations across demographics and diabetes types.
Prevention Insights: Findings could enhance understanding of lifestyle factors in diabetic retinopathy prevention
Public Health: Results could inform public health recommendations, emphasizing physical activity in diabetes care.
Wearable Tech: Using Fitbit data demonstrates wearable technology's potential in chronic disease management.
Clinical Practice Guidance: Findings might help healthcare providers advise diabetic patients on physical activity for eye health.
Highlighting Health Disparities: Exploring subgroup differences could uncover disparities in diabetic retinopathy risk","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to investigate modifiable lifestyle factors that are predictive of pregnancy outcomes in individuals with gestational diabetes. We will investigate physical activity as the primary predictor. We will also compare prevalence estimates among those with vs without gestational diabetes. The second aim of the project is to investigate these questions among those with co-morbid polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and gestational diabetes. The findings from the analyses will provide updated, novel findings on the relationship between objectively-estimated, longitudinal, and granular physical activity patterns and pregnancy outcomes among those with increased risk for adverse outcome. Third, we will assess access to care and insurance status as potential moderators.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will use the data from the EHRs, physical activity data from fitbits, and self-report health surveys (baseline health and medical history).

We will use standard mixed effects regression models and depending on data availability causal inference modeling to assess the predictors of pregnancy outcomes in our defined cohort.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that engaging in sufficient dose of regular physical activity will be a protective factor against adverse pregnancy outcomes in all patient groups, independent of disease and co-morbidity status. We furthermore expect to observe a dose-response in this relationship.
We anticipate that the overall physical activity volume will be higher among those without gestational diabetes (vs those with the diagnosis). We expect similar patterns for PCOS, though to a lesser magnitude.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.  This resource will initially be used by the eMERGE IV consortium, which is an NIH-funded consortium of clinical centers across the United States, with an aim to enroll a prospective cohort of 25,000 individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

Over half of all American adults ≥18 years of age are living with one or more chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many experience multiple symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, depressed mood, anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath) either related to the chronic condition and/or its treatment. Symptom clusters are defined as two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Symptom clusters are challenging to manage and burden both the patient and healthcare system. However, symptom clusters in chronic conditions are understudied and poorly understood. We believe that we can generate new knowledge to improve patient symptom management by using All of Us data. We plan to perform data-driven characterization of symptom clusters in patients diagnosed with one or more chronic conditions and explore predictors (e.g., clinical, genetic, and environmental biomarkers) of different symptom clusters.","Project Purpose(s)

Genetic studies have focused almost exclusively on excess risk for poor health, yet there is considerable ethnic heterogeneity in African derived populations such that not all Black/African Americans (B/AA) have poor type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated comorbidities. Variants in the engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) gene have been previously associated with protection against end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) due to T2D in a B/AA case-control cohort. Leak et al. (Ann Hum Genet. 2009; 73(2):152-9) performed the first comprehensive evaluation of variations across ELMO1 gene in a large B/AA T2D-ESRD case-control population and identified that the minor allele of four intronic variants showed protection, with odds ratios between 0.77-0.84.

Tests of association under the three a priori genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) will be reported. T2D-ESRD phenotypes (microalbuminuria, eGFR, creatinine, etc) will be performed using a series of analysis of variance.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects over 2 billion individuals worldwide and is associated with a number of health and social complications. There are currently three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of AUD, however the effectiveness of these medications are modest at best.
Emerging evidence suggests that the glucagon like peptide 1 agonists (GLP-1As) may be effective in reducing alcohol use. GLP-1As are currently approved for treatment of diabetes mellitus and obesity.  We aim to review the data of patients with diabetes mellitus and/or obesity who are taking GLP-1A versus those not taking GLP-1A, to compare their alcohol use. We will check the odds ratio/prevalence of alcohol use disorder among patients with or without GLP-1A. Other comparisons will include liver enzyme levels, prevalence of hepatic steatosis, and other comorbid conditions among those taking GLP-1A versus those not taking GLP-1A.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (alcohol abuse)","Scientific Approaches
a cross-sectional study to compare patients with diabetes mellitus and/or obesity who are on GLP-1A vs not receiving medication, assessing differences in alcohol consumption and the prevalence of alcohol-related liver disease.
Inclusion criteria: Adult patients aged 18 to 70 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] greater than 30 kg/m2 in non-Asians, and BMI greater than 25kg/m2 in Asians.
Analysis steps : Participants will be sub-stratified into GLP1(+) versus GLP1(-).
The presence of alcohol use disorder will be collected from medical records. The degree of alcohol consumption will be assessed.
Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, BMI, comorbidity, laboratory data including liver enzymes, kidney tests, will be collected from medical records.  Alcohol use disorder will be classified according to the CDC classification system, Differences between groups will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that patients receiving GLP-1A treatment will exhibit a lower prevalence of alcohol use disorder and alcohol related liver disease compared to those not receiving GLP-1A.
If the data support our hypothesis, this finding would further support emerging evidence suggesting the GLP-1As have a role in reducing alcohol intake and potentially decreasing alcohol use disorder.
It is important to note that these anticipated findings are based on emerging evidence, and the actual results may differ. The study's outcomes will provide valuable scientific insights into the relationship between GLP-1A treatment, alcohol use disorder, alcohol-associated liver disease, and can potentially guide future research and clinical practice in this field.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hidradentis suppurativa (HS) is a highly heritable dermatological disease characterized by recurrent, painful nodules and abscesses. It is known to disproportionately affect patients of color. To date, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been published on HS. Our group, the HS Program for Research and Care Excellence (HS ProCARE), has already performed GWAS on HS patients who are in HS ProCARE. We aim to meta-analyze our results HS results from biobanks that have identified HS cases. We expect the results will increase understanding of genetic contributors to HS and improve understanding of the underlying causes of HS and the basis for known comorbidities such as inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to include all participants with HS as well as appropriate controls in All of Us who do not report HS. Depending on covariate distribution, we may perform stratified analyses using matched controls.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.

I intend to study the validity of population stratification by race using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis, and its potential to identify more genetically valid variables to stratify populations on. I will be exploring the genetic diversity of populations with T2DM and examining how individuals of similar ethnic backgrounds cluster in principal component space.
This research is important because population stratification is a common practice in genetic research and can be used to identify genetic risk factors for diseases. However, there is a growing concern about the potential for this practice to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to health disparities. By examining the genetic diversity of populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, I hope to identify more genetically valid variables to stratify populations on and provide insight into how we can use genetics to inform public health interventions in a responsible and equitable way.","Project Purpose(s)

Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)","Scientific Approaches
I plan to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze genetic data from the All of Us dataset, specifically focusing on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. I will initially perform PCA on individual SNPs of interest and potentially on whole genome sequences to obtain larger degrees of scatter. Once I have visualized the variability in principal component space, I will perform clustering analysis on the points to identify commonalities between individuals within clusters. I will also compare the results of population stratification by race to stratification by other potential variables. I will use statistical software such as R or Python to perform these analyses. The research methods will adhere to ethical guidelines and ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants. The tools used will include PCA, clustering analysis, in Google Colaboratory for Python.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study are that the use of principal component analysis to stratify populations by race may not be statistically valid for certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. This could potentially lead to a more accurate and effective method of population stratification, potentially based on other genetic variables that are more relevant to the disease in question.
If successful, these findings could contribute to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of population genetics, as well as personalized medicine. The ability to more accurately stratify populations by genetic factors that are relevant to specific diseases could lead to more effective preventative and treatment strategies, ultimately improving public health outcomes. Ultimately we hope to recommend a novel population stratification method to allow for higher predictability of disease outcomes in population strata.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Do providers prescribe statins for hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 DM less often in patients with NASH than those without NASH?
PCP's are reluctant to prescribe statins to patient's with abnormal liver function tests because of the known risk of hepatotoxicity associated with statin use. However, statins have not only been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and type 2 Diabetes, but have also been proven to have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic properties and may thus inhibit progression from simple steatosis to fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Our goal is to examine differences in cardiovascular (CV) health between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and non-SGM adults (ages 18 and over).

We will also explore potential racial, ethnic, education, income, and geographic location differences CV health within SGM individuals. This project is led by Dr. Billy Caceres who is a CV nurse scientist and a nationally recognized expert on the CV health of SGM individuals. There is growing evidence showing that SGM adults are at greater risk for CV disease than non-SGM individuals. However, potential reasons for these differences are not understood.

Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity. Despite the increasing use of GLP-1 RA, their impact on diabetic retinopathy remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence on the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most of this evidence stems from the multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs, which have defined DR differently. Most of the other studies have not been large enough to adequately answer this question. This study aims to investigate the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and DR and diabetic macular edema progression via the All of Us research database. We will also determine whether lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse access to GLP-1 RA and thus worse DR.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
To determine if there is an association between use of GLP-1 RAs and progression/presence of diabetic retinopathy (none/NPDR/PDR) or diabetic macular edema that required treatment in the form of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or corticosteroid (i.e., triamcinolone) injection, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Two cohorts: One on GLP-1 RA therapy and the other not on GLP-1 RA therapy. Only patients with type 2 DM. Patients should not have PDR prior to initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy. Patients should be treatment-naive (no prior intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy).
Covariates: Age at diagnosis of DM, sex, birth country, race/ethnicity, education level, insurance status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, smoking history, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI).
Multivariate logistic regression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that GLP-1 RA therapy is not associated with progression or presence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema that requires treatment in the form of intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy. As the literature currently has conflicting evidence on this question, we hope this study will provide further guidance on this matter. Additionally, we hope that this study will encourage primary care physicians and endocrinologists to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus aggressively to minimize all the associated systemic complications of diabetes mellitus including worsening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema from worsening control of blood glycemic levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Datasets: Fitbit accelerometry data; data regarding diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, blood glucose metrics, cholesterol metrics, and blood pressure.

Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will explore machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are at substantially increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.  A reliable predictive model could be very helpful for identifying individuals at the greatest risk so that they can modify lifestyle and health habits and their physicians can consider pharmacologic interventions and closer monitoring.
We are particularly interested in determining whether the model is as effective for historically underrepresented groups as it is for historically well represented groups.

The objective of this research is to identify genetic coding variants within the SGLT2 gene that are associated with renal glycosuria. Previous studies have shown that mutations within this gene can lead to renal glycosuria. Medications targeting SGLT2 have been developed, demonstrating benefits for the management of conditions such as diabetes and obesity. We intend to identify individuals from a local population who harbor mutations associated with renal glycosuria, and investigate their response to SGLT2 inhibitors through a prospective pharmacogenetic clinical study.","Project Purpose(s)

The scientific methodology primarily involves scanning the SGLT2 gene for variants associated with renal glycosuria. The dataset will encompass all participants who have undergone whole genome sequencing. We will employ a logistic regression model to evaluate the associations between genetic variants and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for renal glycosuria. Data analysis will be conducted in Jupyter notebooks using R programming language.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate not only the re-identification of known coding variants associated with renal glycosuria, but also the discovery of novel variants that could have significant implications for the fields of diabetes and obesity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.
The goal of this demonstration project is to validate previous research showing potential interactions between dementia, diabetes, and hypertension, with an explicit consideration of race/ ethnicity.","Project Purpose(s)

This work has been approved, reviewed, and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy.)","Scientific Approaches
Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I will be investigating the utility of genetic risk score derivation to classify diabetes type among subjects in the ""The Immune Response in human Type 1 Diabetes Etiology"" cross-sectional study being performed at the Stanford Diabetes Research Center. The genetic risk score estimates we are using were developed primarily based on a population of subjects of European ancestry and it is uncertain whether these risk estimates translate to people of non-European ancestry, which is one of the questions we will attempt to answer.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I will stratify diabetes type genetic risk score (GRS) by ancestry to determine if the distribution of GRS has significant variation by ancestry group. For populations where GRS is significantly different from those with European ancestry, I will estimate population specific risk scales and test if these risk estimates are similar in our pediatric study cohort when stratified by ancestry. For statistical methods, I will derive genetic ancestry using pre-trained machine learning based classification models based on principal components analysis and will analyze the correlation (R2) between genetic and self-reported ancestry. I will use parametric t-testing to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean between each ancestry group with European ancestry individuals. Bonferroni correction will be applied to adjust alpha threshold for multiple testing. Percentiles of GRS derived from All of Us will be translated to absolute risk calculations as a product of prevalence.","Anticipated Findings
Our findings would be particularly notable if the genetic risk score estimates are not valid in subjects of non-European ancestry as it would imply that polygenic risk scores do not simply translate across different genetic ancestry thus requiring modification or otherwise development of new risk estimates specific to subjects non-European ancestry. Alternatively, it would also be significant to find that the genetic risk estimates are able to be validated in populations of non-European ancestry as it would potentially remove a barrier to bring polygenic risk scores to the patient bedside to aid in diagnosis or identify high risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hidradentis suppurativa (HS) is a highly heritable dermatological disease characterized by recurrent, painful nodules and abscesses. It is known to disproportionately affect patients of color. To date, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been published on HS. Our group, the HS Program for Research and Care Excellence (HS ProCARE), has already performed GWAS on HS patients who are in HS ProCARE. We aim to meta-analyze our results HS results from biobanks that have identified HS cases. We expect the results will increase understanding of genetic contributors to HS and improve understanding of the underlying causes of HS and the basis for known comorbidities such as inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hidradenitis suppurativa)","Scientific Approaches
We will first examine the summary statistics of HS patients in the All of Us dataset and perform data cleaning as necessary on HS and relevant covariates (age, body mass index, sex, smoking status, self-reported race, and genetic ancestry). We plan to include all participants with HS as well as appropriate controls in All of Us who do not report HS. Depending on covariate distribution, we may perform stratified analyses using matched controls. To assess genetic variation and to identify matched controls, we anticipate running principal component analysis. For GWAS, we will evaluate use of HAIL and/or EPACTS using the EMMAX test to control for sample relatedness.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated results will bolster evidence for the genetic variants that are associated with HS in our dataset, as well as potentially identify additional genetic variants that influence HS and related outcomes.

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Lifespan diabetes and diabetes complications)","Scientific Approaches
To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations. Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for many other complex diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

""I aim to investigate the correlation between genetic markers and the onset of Type 2 diabetes, particularly in diverse populations. This research is vital because it may uncover specific genetic predispositions that contribute to the disease's higher prevalence in certain ethnic groups. Understanding these relationships could lead to more targeted public health interventions and personalized treatment strategies, helping to reduce the disease's incidence and improve the quality of care for those affected. At this exploratory stage, I am seeking to refine my hypothesis by identifying patterns and trends within the AoU data, which represents a wide array of demographics, thus offering a robust foundation for comprehensive genomic analysis.""","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
My study will employ a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to identify genetic variations linked to Type 2 diabetes. I plan to utilize the AoU genomic dataset alongside self-reported health information. Data analysis will be conducted using statistical software such as R and Python for data cleaning, processing, and analysis. Specifically, I will use Python's pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation, and R's Bioconductor for in-depth genetic analysis. Machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and logistic regression, will be applied to predict disease risk based on genetic markers. Furthermore, I will leverage visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python for data representation. The robustness of the AoU dataset allows for cross-referencing genetic data with lifestyle factors, providing a comprehensive analysis of potential genotype-phenotype correlations.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate identifying novel genetic markers associated with Type 2 diabetes, particularly in underrepresented populations. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of genetic susceptibility to the disease, potentially uncovering new targets for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, this research could lead to the development of predictive models for disease risk based on genetic profiles, informing personalized medicine approaches. The study's results will add to the existing scientific literature by providing insights into the interplay between genetics and lifestyle factors in the onset of Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, by focusing on diverse populations, the study aims to address current gaps in genetic research, contributing to more equitable healthcare outcomes. The comprehensive analysis of AoU's diverse dataset will offer a valuable resource for future research and may inform public health strategies aimed at prevention and management of the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest
