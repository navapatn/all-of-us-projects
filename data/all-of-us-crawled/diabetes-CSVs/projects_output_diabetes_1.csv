The project aims to investigate the prevalence and occurrence rate of women having a high body mass index during pregnancy who have a high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in the U.S. population concerning the variety present within the United States including age groups, races, ethnicities, geographical regions, education level, and income level. This study will demonstrate the association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the later stages of pregnancy and also explore the impact at various levels of maternal BMI on the development of GDM among pregnant women in the later stages of pregnancy. This will help to promote health equity among different demographic and clinical subgroups provide endorsement and potential guidance to scientists and clinical management and optimize patient care in the U.S. population.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use the All of Us study, controlled tire dataset v7. Participants with a high BMI will be identified based on WHO cutoffs. The eligibility criteria are based on females assigned at birth, aged 18-49 years who are pregnant. The prevalence of participants will be estimated by subpopulation based on age groups, races, ethnicities, geographical regions, education level, and income level. The dataset will be checked for normality, descriptive characteristics[For continuous: median (IQR) and for categorical n(%)], and association.will be established. The Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated by using binomial regression for all GDM individuals. P-value<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.","Anticipated Findings
The study may identify specific thresholds or categories of maternal BMI during pregnancy that are related to higher or lower risks of developing GDM in the later stages of pregnancy. So, it can contribute to risk stratification and help in developing the goal interventions for high-risk individuals.
The findings enhance the timing of BMI assessment during pregnancy concerning GDM risk.
Moreover, this work may reveal the potential impact of maternal BMI during pregnancy on neonatal health outcomes and It is expected that maternal BMI levels associated with increased GDM risk may also be linked to adverse neonatal outcomes. The anticipated findings could have important clinical implications for prenatal care and GDM management. Healthcare providers may use the results to inform risk assessment protocols and develop personalized care plans for pregnant women based on their BMI status.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program. Chronic disease is a rising contributor to mortality and morbidity, and many chronic disease risk factors are modifiable. Learning how we can more effectively prevent and control chronic disease among diverse patient populations will be essential for population health improvement. We specifically plan to study the intersection between different chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that interact with one another and cause progressive disability.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use a combination of descriptive tools (e.g. estimating prevalence, incidence of various conditions) and modeling tools to model the accumulation of disease risk factors and mortality. Our work will be performed primarily using All of Us data with additional work performed in other population-based data sources including EHR data, UK Biobank, and other large studies.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our study will document the prevalence and risk of developing various types of multimorbidity and chronic disease burden over time and will identify novel risk factors for multimorbidity which could be targeted both to improve population health and to improve health equity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

What metrics of discrimination or factors create an adverse social determinants of health profile relevant to the diagnosis and presence of type 2 diabetes? Using an aggregated genetic risk score, are impacts similar for variants linked to functional categories of type 2 diabetes, such as body fat or beta cell function related variants? What, if any, SDOH have an affect on diagnosis and presence of type 2 diabetes?
These are exploratory questions as this workspace will be used to identify any possible metrics of discrimination when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes. I hope to use this workspace to come to a better understanding on if SDOH have similar impacts of genetic risk scores when determining risk for type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

This study will increase knowledge regarding genetic and epigenetic risk factors regarding type 2 diabetes in diverse populations. By better understanding the metrics of discrimination used in calculating risk and the diagnosis of this disease, there will be more awareness of the SDOH for underrepresented populations in science regarding type 2 diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hundreds of genetic variants have been linked with diabetes and related metabolic conditions, including for obesity, type-two diabetes, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin).. However, the biological pathways by which they act is not yet clear, nor have all causal genetic variants been identified, especially those in the fewest individuals. We intend to run genome-wide association studies between these phenotypes (e.g. individuals who suffer from diabetes versus those who do not, or BMI as a continuous trait), and other diabetes-related phenotypes (HbA1c, glucose etc) against genetic variants from the Whole Genome Sequencing data. Our results will improve the field’s understanding of the biological pathways for these conditions. The All of Us data set is crucial for answering these questions, due to its diverse genetic ancestry. Whole genome sequencing contains nearly all genetic variants, down to the rarest (<1% of individuals), which aids our ability to identify causal genetic mutations.","Project Purpose(s)

We will be performing genome-wide association studies, comparing the frequency of variants between individuals who do and do not suffer from diabetes and other complications, or looking to identify variants that are associated with increased or decreased BMI/HbA1c. We will use the software tool REGENIE to perform our analysis, which rigorously controls for known confounders. Our association analyses will be performed using the most recent release of whole-genome sequencing data. We will also perform downstream analyses, such as Fine Mapping, which inform us about which variants are and are not causal.","Anticipated Findings

Delirium, a severe medical condition prevalent among older patients, is often linked to various risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), potentially due to shared mechanisms increasing dementia susceptibility. Intriguingly, research suggests that metformin, a medication for DM, not only extends lifespan but also reduces delirium risk in DM patients. Additionally, exploring metformin's effects on genome-wide DNA methylation have shed light on its mechanisms, including pathways related to longevity, AMPK, inflammation, and HIF-1 alpha. However, a deeper understanding of metformin's role in longevity and its impact on delirium risk is warranted. To address this gap, our study aims to investigate metformin's potential influence on delirium risk as well as mortality risk, and also investigate genetic profiles modulating such potential association by examining genome-wide genetic status in patients with and without a history of delirium.","Project Purpose(s)

Dataset: All of Us Controlled Data v07
Tools: R
Research methods:
- Investigate the prevalence of delirium among individuals with and without a history of metformin use, stratified by the status for diabetes mellitus.
- Compare the frequency of SNP alleles related to delirium as a trait among the population first. Then we evaluate the difference of such potential association between participants who have used metformin and those who have not to investigate the potential interaction between genotype and medical use history.","Anticipated Findings
Conducting the described research study could yield several anticipated findings that can contribute significantly to the field of delirium, pharmacogenomics, and the potential interaction between medication use and genetic predispositions. Findings may reveal a lower prevalence of delirium among individuals with a history of metformin use compared to those without such a history, particularly among those with diabetes mellitus. In addition, findings might indicate a differential effect of metformin on individuals with different genetic predispositions towards delirium. Overall, the anticipated findings from this research study could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between metformin use, genetic factors, and the pathophysiology of delirium, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical care, risk assessment, and potentially the development of targeted interventions for preventing or managing delirium in at-risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are commonly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, the response rate is relatively low. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by various germline and somatic mutations and their roles in patients' response to ICIs therapy are not well understood. We seek to use All-of-Us data to identify potential correlations/association between germline genomic alterations and tumor sensitivity to ICIs. We believe gene/drug interactions with medicines used to treat chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and COPD) may also associate with response of NSCLC to ICI. Thus, appropriate management of co-morbid conditions may improve response to ICI in NSCLC patients.","Project Purpose(s)

The second or second level of the primary cohort are those patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer, treatment with ICIs, genomic data, and who have drug codes associated with medications to control co-morbid inflammatory conditions ( hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, diabetes, and obesity).
We will  establish a timeline for outcomes through timestamps provided in the data during the analysis phase using R or Python processing.

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers.

This study aims to integrate polygenic scores and pharmacogenetics to investigate drug interactions, enhancing personalized medicine. Polygenic scores, summarizing genetic predispositions for peripheral biomarkers or disease risk factors, combined with pharmacogenetic data—how genetic variation affects drug response—can offer insights into individual drug efficacy and safety. We focus on statins, hypertensive drugs, and hyperglycemic agents. For instance, specific genetic variants influence statin metabolism, potentially causing side effects like myopathy. Similarly, genetic factors affect hypertensive drug efficacy, such as beta-blockers in individuals with certain genotypes showing less blood pressure reduction. For hyperglycemic drugs, genetic variations can predict response to metformin, guiding optimal diabetes management. This research will elucidate genetic factors underlying drug interactions, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Our research will utilize large-scale genomic datasets in All of Us with genetic profiles and detailed medication histories. We'll analyze polygenic scores—aggregated from millions of genetic variants associated with clinical biomarkers —and pharmacogenetic markers relevant to drug metabolism and efficacy. For statins, hypertensive, and hyperglycemic drugs, we'll examine specific genetic markers that modulate drug metabolism enzymes (e.g., CYP450 variants) and transporters (e.g., SLCO1B1 for statins). Tools like Hail for working with large genomics datasets, statsmodels in Python for statistical analysis and machine learning, and PharmGKB database for pharmacogenetics information will be pivotal.","Anticipated Findings
Our goal is to understand if integrating polygenics with pharmacogenetics can identify patients who would benefit from tailored or alternative therapies. For example, consider integrating a polygenic score for LDL cholesterol with a pharmacogenomic alleles in SLCO1B1. Polygenic scores aggregate the effects of numerous genetic variants associated with LDL cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, the SLCO1B1 gene encodes a liver transporter protein that significantly influences statin drug metabolism; certain variants in this gene are linked to increased risk of statin-induced myopathy. For individuals with a high polygenic score for LDL cholesterol, indicating a genetic predisposition to high LDL levels, statins might be essential for managing cardiovascular risk. However, if these individuals also carry a risk allele in SLCO1B1, they might be at a higher risk for adverse reactions from standard statin doses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Over half of all American adults ≥18 years of age are living with one or more chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many experience multiple symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, depressed mood, anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath) either related to the chronic condition and/or its treatment.

This research aims to elucidate the genetic etiology of obesity. Specifically, we intend to assess the relationship between certain genetic variants and the incidence of obesity, as well as how these genetic factors interact with environmental and lifestyle factors to influence individual body weight.
Obesity is a major global health challenge, associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of obesity will advance our knowledge of how to better predict, prevent, and treat this condition. It will also contribute to the development of personalized medicine and public health interventions that could ameliorate the impact of obesity on society.","Project Purpose(s)

Utilizing the All of Us dataset, which includes genomic data alongside environmental and lifestyle information, we will apply bioinformatics tools to correlate specific alleles with obesity phenotypes. Our analysis will involve statistical methods to control for confounding factors and to ensure robustness of the genetic associations. Additionally, we will use pathway analysis tools to interpret the biological significance of our findings and to understand the mechanisms by which genetic factors contribute to obesity. Our approach is integrative, leveraging the rich, multidimensional data of the All of Us cohort to yield insights into the complex interplay between genetics and obesity.","Anticipated Findings

We hope to use a dataset consisting of cancer patients. Since some cancer treatments possess more of a cardiovascular burden to patients, we will likely look into patients with cancers that are treated with such regimens (eg. breast cancer).

Cardio-oncology is a new interdisciplinary field intended to provide a more holistic approach to caring for cancer patients.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications.

Diabetes stands as one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases, exerting a disproportionate impact on both sex and racial/ethnic minority populations. While numerous studies have investigated the correlation between social determinants of health and diabetes, a significant gap persists in our comprehension of the most pertinent factors within the intricate landscape of social determinants of health datasets related to diabetes.
1)	What are the primary social determinants of health factors associated with diabetes across diverse populations?
2)	How do these factors vary in their impact on diabetes within specific sex and race/ethnicity groups?
By addressing these pivotal questions, our research endeavors to refine our understanding of the complex relationship between social determinants of health and diabetes outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To address this gap, there is a critical need for sophisticated computational modeling, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms capable of handling high-dimensional data in large datasets, to account for social determinants of health  factors in diabetes. We will use supervised ML approaches to examine the associations of individual health factors and neighborhood factors in relation to Diabetes . The supervised ML approach is appropriate because it seeks patterns in the training data and uses that information to make predictions for unseen data without relying on strict model distributions. Four different tree-based machine learning algorithms including: 1) Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, 2) Decision Tree, 3) Random tree, and 4) Gradient Boosting Machines (gbm) will be used to compare their performance in predicting the risk of Diabetes. The root mean squared error and sensitivity analysis will serve as primary indicators of predictive accuracy.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated outcomes of our study hold the promise of making significant strides in comprehending and mitigating health disparities among minority populations, with a specific focus on predicting the risk of diabetes. We envisage that the development of a predictive framework will play a pivotal role in identifying the key determinants of diabetes.
We anticipate two distinct outcomes from our research: Firstly, we aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between neighborhood environmental factors and diabetes. This understanding will contribute substantially to the refinement of targeted interventions and strategies for the prediction of race/ethnicity- and sex-specific risks associated with diabetes. Secondly, our study aims to pinpoint the key determinants that influence race/ethnicity- and sex-specific disparities in the realm of diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MASLD represents a spectrum of liver pathology ranging from simple steatosis to metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, commonly used in the management of T2DM, have shown promise in improving metabolic parameters and possibly influencing hepatic outcomes in MASLD. However, the long-term effects of these medications on HCC incidence in patients with MASLD remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following the use of GLP-1 agonists in patients diagnosed with steatotic liver disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hepatocellular carcinoma)","Scientific Approaches
Data Source: AllofUs participants diagnosed with fatty liver disease/steatotic liver disease and prescribed GLP-1 agonists between TBD dates.
Study Population: Patients aged 18 years and above with a diagnosis of fatty liver disease (MASLD, MASH, NAFLD or NASH) confirmed via imaging or histology, who have been prescribed GLP-1 agonists for at least one year during the study period.
Outcome Measure: The primary outcome is the incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients exposed to GLP-1 agonists compared to those not exposed.
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will summarize baseline characteristics. The incidence of HCC will be calculated per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for potential confounders.","Anticipated Findings
This study hypothesizes that GLP-1 agonists may have a protective effect against the development of HCC in patients with fatty liver disease due to their metabolic benefits. However, there is also a possibility that GLP-1 agonists may influence hepatic carcinogenesis through alternative mechanisms. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the long-term hepatocellular outcomes associated with the use of GLP-1 agonists in patients with fatty liver disease. Understanding the potential impact of GLP-1 agonists on hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in patients with fatty liver disease is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies in this population. The findings from this study may inform clinical decision-making and contribute to the growing body of evidence on the role of GLP-1 agonists in liver-related outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a highly polygenic disease, has been progressively increasing to epidemic proportions. We are constructing risk prediction tools for T2D and complications that could help guide clinicians implement personalized screening and management approaches to prevent T2D and complications. The integration of polygenic risk scores (PRS) into risk prediction models enhances the performance of these models. Yet the T2D prediction models that consider both clinical risks and T2D PRS fail to account for the underlying heterogeneous pathophysiology of T2D.
We hypothesize that classification models, trained on a large data set and validated on a diverse group of patients, that exhaust the genetic risk for the pathologies involved in T2D development along with the clinical and environmental risk factors will provide more accurate predictions and guide individualized interventions to prevent both T2D and its multiple complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
Our hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims:
Aim 1. To develop a classification model for predicting T2D based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
After identifying individuals with T2D as well as all relevant clinical and lifestyle risk factors and calculating the PRS for T2D and relevant risk factors, we will use a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm for classification. We will then select the top features associated with the disease and use them to build a simplified prediction model.
Aim 2. To develop classification models for predicting T2D complications based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
We will identify people with T2D microvascular (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy) and macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease) complications. Multiple PRS for risk factors of each complication, T2D PRS, and the targeted complication PRS will be integrated into the classification model.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study will improve risk prediction by taking account of the genetic risks of the underlying pathologies involved in the development of T2D and complications as well as the clinical and lifestyle risk factors. We except the classification models for T2D and complication to achieve high predictability in diverse populations. We expect to determine the key risk factors for T2D complications and use them to build simplified focused classification models that will help clinicians make person-centered screening and management decisions to prevent complications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genetic studies have focused almost exclusively on excess risk for poor health, yet there is considerable ethnic heterogeneity in African derived populations such that not all Black/African Americans (B/AA) have poor type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated comorbidities. Variants in the engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) gene have been previously associated with protection against end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) due to T2D in a B/AA case-control cohort. Leak et al. (Ann Hum Genet. 2009; 73(2):152-9) performed the first comprehensive evaluation of variations across ELMO1 gene in a large B/AA T2D-ESRD case-control population and identified that the minor allele of four intronic variants showed protection, with odds ratios between 0.77-0.84.

Tests of association under the three a priori genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) will be reported. T2D-ESRD phenotypes (microalbuminuria, eGFR, creatinine, etc) will be performed using a series of analysis of variance. SNPs that showed nominal evidence for association will be further adjusted for age, sex, and genome-wide principal components.
Adjusted multivariable linear regression and unconditional logistic regression analyses will be performed.","Anticipated Findings
To our knowledge, the ELMO1 is the first candidate gene reported to show protection against T2D-ESRD in B/AAs. Hence, we aim to confirm and extend the previous report of associations between ELMO1 variants with T2D-ESRD and quantitative traits in B/AA.

Aim 1: What are the factors influencing early onset (before age 45), co-morbid peripheral artery disease in Black and White patients with diabetes?
Aim 2: What is the relationship between the screening practices and limb amputation in patients with diabetes and concomitant peripheral artery disease?
Aim 3: What factors influence practice decisions to amputate a lower limb in Black and nonblack patients in the United States?
Rationale: Evidence suggests that Black patients have a higher prevalence of asymptomatic PAD and are less aware of symptoms. This issue collectively puts them at increased risk for a delay in care. Black persons diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in midlife ages (45-64) while white persons were diagnosed with kidney disease in later life (65-74), partially attributable to better access to control diabetes. It is anticipated that this will also hold true for PAD.","Project Purpose(s)

Study Design: The proposed observational cohort study using the All of Us (AoU) Researcher Workbench.
Sampling Frame: Data from 2018 through the most currently available date at the time of study initiation.
Inclusion Criteria: Participants with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes, at least 18 years of age at the time of agreement to participate in the AoU initiative.
Exclusion Criteria: Any record without a documentation of race
Estimated Sample Size and Power calculation: This is an observational study using an established database. Our previous research using this data source found an estimated 202,000 persons with Type
Type II diabetes in AoU Data Workbench. Based on CDC reporting,6 9% (an estimated 18,180 of the AoU records), of persons with Type II diabetes also will have PAD, and of these 4.6% (an estimated 836 of the AoU records) will possibly have a limb amputation. These are adequately large numbers to support statistical analyses of the proposed hypotheses.","Anticipated Findings
H1A: A decrease in the documentation of screening for PAD will be associated with a higher rate of limb amputations among Black patients compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
H1B: A decrease in the documentation of screening for PAD will be associated with a higher rate of limb amputations in Black patients with diabetes less than 45 years of age compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
H2: An increase in the documentation of vascular treatment services will be associated with a decrease in limb amputations at all stages of diabetes with concomitant PAD.
H3: An increase in the documentation of screening for PAD using an ankle brachial index (ABI) will be associated with a decrease in rate of limb amputations.

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults in the US. In 2021, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy reached 26.43% in the US. The random survival forest, a machine learning method, is a robust prediction approach. However, its accuracy in predicting the development of diabetic retinopathy compared to the traditional Cox proportional hazards regression method remains unclear. Our aims are to:
(a)	Identify risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
(b)	Develop a random survival forest model to predict the onset of diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM
(c)	Develop a Cox proportional hazards regression model to predict the onset of diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM
(d)	Compare random survival forest and Cox proportional hazards regression models in predicting the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM","Project Purpose(s)

Retrospectively, we will construct a cohort of individuals with T2DM and follow up the cohort for the development of diabetic retinopathy, including non-proliferative, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema. We will extract data on demographic and clinical information, blood glucose control, blood pressure control, and lipid control for this cohort. Then we will use logistic regression to identify risk factors for diabetic retinopathy using cohort data. Subsequently, we will use risk factors along with the cohort data to train and test prediction models, which include Cox proportional hazards regression model and random survival forest model. For the random survival forest model, we will find the optimal set of hyperparameters using k-fold cross validation and grid search cross-validation. Finally, we will compare the predictive performance of the models using the Harrell’s C-index and the integrated Brier score.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that variables such as diabetes duration, fasting blood glucose, hypertension, total cholesterol are risk factors for diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, we anticipate that the random survival forest model will outperform the Cox proportional hazards regression model in predicting the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM. By leveraging the big data from the All of Us Research Program and applying machine learning technology, we will develop an accurate prediction model that can facilitate the identification of individuals with high risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concern. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications for CKD and DM. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities. The study will also use predictive tools such as machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes in diabetes patients such as Uncontrolled Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications.

The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced.

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics.

This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study.

Genetic studies have focused almost exclusively on excess risk for poor health, yet there is considerable ethnic heterogeneity in African derived populations such that not all Black/African Americans (B/AA) have poor type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated comorbidities. Variants in the engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) gene have been previously associated with protection against end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) due to T2D in a B/AA case-control cohort. Leak et al. (Ann Hum Genet. 2009; 73(2):152-9) performed the first comprehensive evaluation of variations across ELMO1 gene in a large B/AA T2D-ESRD case-control population and identified that the minor allele of four intronic variants showed protection, with odds ratios between 0.77-0.84.
This study will assess the replication of association of previously discovered ELMO1 variants with T2D-ESRD, as well as further refine the location of associations within the ~126kb region.","Project Purpose(s)

We propose to perform a case-control association study using the 26,405 genetic variants spanning introns 8 through 15 of the ELMO1 gene (GRCh38 coordinates chr7: 37133234-37259180) in B/AA case-control participants B/AA cases (diagnosis of T2D-ESRD) and controls (without a current diagnosis of T2D and ESRD) will be used for the current analysis.
Tests of association under the three a priori genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) will be reported. T2D-ESRD phenotypes (microalbuminuria, eGFR, creatinine, etc) will be performed using a series of analysis of variance. SNPs that showed nominal evidence for association will be further adjusted for age, sex, and genome-wide principal components.
Adjusted multivariable linear regression and unconditional logistic regression analyses will be performed.","Anticipated Findings
To our knowledge, the ELMO1 is the first candidate gene reported to show protection against T2D-ESRD in B/AAs. Hence, we aim to confirm and extend the previous report of associations between ELMO1 variants with T2D-ESRD and quantitative traits in B/AA.
As public health has shown B/AA with T2D are at an increased risk for developing ESRD in the presence of a family history of ESRD. To date genetic studies have focused almost exclusively","Demographic Categories of Interest

In this workspace, based on our results generated from French participants, we aim to confirm associations between rare, loss-of-function or gain-of-function DNA variants and the risk of metabolic disorders (or the level of associated traits) using All of Us. The rare variants will be located either i/ in coding exons from candidate genes involved in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or in associated traits, or ii/ in non-coding genomic loci. To assess the functional effect of DNA variants we will either use in silico and/or in vitro studies. This project should lead to the identification or confirmation of functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the following datasets: whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA arrays
For WES and WGS, the analysis will be focused on rare variants in specific loci  (specific genes or specific non coding regions).or interest. DNA arrayswill be used for the calculation of genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for metabolic disorders or traits.
Genetic association analyses will be done between genetic markers (rare variants and/or PRS) and metabolic traits, when adjusting for relevant covariates (including sex, age, ancestry for instance).
Of note, to refine the analyses, we will use a functional genetic approach focusing on rare variants found in All of Us. For these in vitro studies, we have notably developed genome editing (i.e. CRISPR/cas9) in several human cell lines, which enables the functional analyses of small genomic regions (like an entire enhancer) or even of a single point mutation.","Anticipated Findings
This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neurodevelopment (including conditions like autism and ADHD), genetic markers of such conditions, and neurodegeneration (including dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s). We will examine the role of several intervenable targets between neurodevelopmental and neurodegeneration. These lifestyle factors are known to impact neurodegeneration in the general population, but their role in people with neurodevelopmental conditions is unknown. The purpose of examining these factors is to examine if the risk of cognitive decline may be mitigated via improvements to these targets. These include cardiometabolic health (including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes), cognitive reserve (including higher education levels), physical activity, and accelerated biological aging.","Project Purpose(s)

We will compare rates of neurodegenerative disorders across people with genetic liability for autism, ADHD, and ID, identified via polygenic risk scores, which will be expressed as a z-score based on the mean/standard deviation. We will examine data across the life course for evidence that genetic risk for neurodevelopmental conditions is linked to neurodegeneration and we will estimate the genetic correlation between the two using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression. We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle. We will use DNA methylation data to construct epigenetic clocks to examine accelerated aging. We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings
Preliminary studies have suggested neurodegeneration may be more pronounced in people with neurodevelopmental conditions. The ultimate purpose of this research is to increase understanding of neurodegeneration risk in people with neurodevelopmental conditions, with an eye towards modifiable factors. We will also examine the genetic link between genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, which may illuminate causal pathways to neurodegeneration. Using high-resolution phenotyping available in All of Us uniquely allows the examination of early-onset degeneration. This is important, as early-onset degeneration may be a target for intervention. Other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and cardiovascular health, may also be important targets for intervention. These explorations hope to improve public health. Overall, this study aims to expand our understanding of dementia in neurodivergent people, with the ultimate goal of improving health and well-being.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We wish to investigate what are there are genetic determinants or risk factors of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is a common infertility disorder affecting approximately 8-13% of women who are of reproductive-age. While common, PCOS is also a complex and multifactorial disease without a clear genetic cause. PCOS overlaps with other diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndromes. It is not clear if these associated diseases are caused by or are consequences of PCOS, or if PCOS and these other disease collectively have a common cause. In addition, women with PCOS have negative body image perceptions, low self-esteem, depression, and decreased quality of life. There is a need to increase knowledge surrounding the risk factors and determinants of PCOS to improve risk identification, disease diagnosis, and disease treatment and management options.","Project Purpose(s)

We will explore PCOS correlations in different cohort groups such as age, genetic ancestry, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, geography, if applicable.

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Lifespan diabetes and diabetes complications)","Scientific Approaches
To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations.  Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for many other complex diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Obesity is a growing national epidemic that is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular mortality and disability. Studies have shown that dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis is related to metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. We are interested in the role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex in obesity. The MCU complex is the key regulator of mitochondrial calcium signaling; functional defects of MCU causes dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide.  T2DM is associated with a variety of major health complications and affects individuals of different ethnicities and genetic ancestries.  The onset and progression of T2DM can be significantly influenced by personal behaviors, environmental factors and genetic variation.  In this study, we aim to identify the genetic risk factors associated with T2DM for people with different genetic ancestries and ethnicities.  Identifying genetic risk factors for T2DM is important because they can help us better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease and potentially develop new treatments and prevention strategies to advance precision medicine. The results would help to develop personalized plans that are tailored to stratify T2DM risk depending on the specific ancestry and ethnicity of the patient.","Project Purpose(s)

Our lab has developed gene-constrained methods for comparative analysis of genetic data between patient and non-patient populations of diseases that are affected by multiple genes.  These new methods are complementary to the well-known Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and can identify disease-associated genetic variants that are often missed by GWAS.  We have used one such method successfully, employing the relatively small dataset that was then available, to identify dozens of previously unknown genes that are potentially associated with T2DM.

The analyses in this workspace will take both ancestry and gender into consideration to sensitize the detection of relevant genes and to ensure that the risk genes we identify are more accurate, relevant, and specific to the development of T2DM.

When one hears the phrase ""health disparities"" they instantly think of traditional differences such as race, age, and physical impairment in chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and arthritis. What many fail to realize is there are additional groups that make up a large proportion of individuals that lack access to and/or receive very little information regarding different diseases and outcomes. The conditions in these subpopulations are often reported more when it comes to drug and/or alcohol abuse or mental illnesses. But why? Why isn't the playing field leveled to where all people can have access to information that may be vital to their health if not access to insurance and the proper care? Our studies aim to highlight the health discrepancies amongst transgender subpopulations and between their cisgender counterparts to identify factors contributing to the differences in health care access and reporting.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate to support our notion that there are major discrepancies not only amongst the transgender subpopulations but also when compared to the cisgender counterparts.

This study will primarily investigate whether a multidimensional whole health index, integrating measures of physical, mental, social, environmental, and financial well-being, offers a more robust prediction of chronic disease risk – including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers – within the ""All of Us"" cohort compared to traditional risk models that often rely heavily on clinical factors. Additionally, the research will explore if and how disparities across demographic groups (age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) are reflected in variations in these whole health metrics and whether these variations potentially explain differences in chronic disease burden.   A successful outcome could enhance chronic disease prediction capabilities, empowering healthcare providers with more accurate tools for early intervention and personalized prevention strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
My research methods will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation matrices to gain a comprehensive understanding of data distributions and relationships among variables.  Operationalizing whole health domains into quantifiable metrics will be crucial (for example, using survey scores validated for mental health assessment ). Factor analysis will be employed to reduce dimensionality within the dataset. Regression analysis will then determine the relationships between the whole health index and chronic disease outcomes while controlling for confounding factors. Finally, I'll leverage machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks, to enhance predictive capabilities, identify key features, and effectively model complex interactions","Anticipated Findings
The overarching hypothesis is that the multidimensional whole health index will significantly outperform traditional risk models for chronic disease prediction. Additionally, it's anticipated that certain whole health domains might emerge as particularly strong predictors for specific chronic diseases (e.g., the role of social isolation in cardiovascular health). Crucially, the study aims to unveil how variations in whole health metrics align with patterns of chronic disease distribution across demographic groups, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms driving health disparities. These findings have the potential to revolutionize how we approach chronic disease risk assessment, going beyond isolated risk factors to a more holistic and personalized framework. The identified key whole health metrics will pinpoint crucial areas for targeted interventions at both the individual and population health level.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize that we can reduce the gap in the performance of PRSs between diverse populations by developing methods to generate PRSs for populations of diverse ancestry.  All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program.

Are there specific genetic variants associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients with diabetes?
What is the prevalence of cardiovascular genetic risk factors among the diabetic Hispanic population?
Studying genetic variations linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes individuals, especially in the Hispanic community, is essential for progressing personalize care and improving health outcomes. Identifying distinct genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is the first step in developing personalized prevention and treatment approaches, especially in minority groups like US Hispanics. Further, a better understanding genetic predisposition may improve our biological understanding of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and facilitate specific therapies to lessen the burden of cardiovascular problems in this at-risk population.","Project Purpose(s)

Cohort selection: Create cohort of diabetic patients in the All of Us program. We will then identify patients who develop the outcome of interest (the presence of cardiovascular disease [CVD]).  Data collection: Data will be collected from the All of Us database. The data should include demographic details, clinical parameters, individuals' genetics and outcomes related to diabetes and CVD.
Generating Descriptive statistics of the population:
Statistical Analysis: The use of statistical software (eg. Python) to generate descriptive statistics for the diabetes cohort. It will include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
Candidate gene study to identify if candidate SNPs (rs6923761, rs57922, rs9299870) are associated with risk of CVD in diabetes patients. This will involve the association of these SNPs within cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings: Specific genetic variations, interacting with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling system, provide a complex risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We anticipate that genetic variations in the GLP-1 signaling system may impact the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists by affecting insulin production, glucose metabolism, and atherosclerosis as well as overall cardiovascular risk. The study's findings are anticipated to improve our comprehension of why specific diabetes patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and how their reaction to therapy can differ depending on genetic factors.

I will impute SV variants in these cohorts in diabetes regions. I will then perform discovery and fine mapping for diabetes associations using SNV and imputed SV genotypes.
Additionally, to explore potential evidence of somatic instability at diabetes associated SVs, we will investigate allelic heterogeneity of long reads overlapping these regions.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.

Research question: Are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) associated with a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes?
Rationale: GLP-1RAs, commonly prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity, have recently gained attention for their anti-inflammatory effects in several organs, including the retina. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive retinal disease and the most common cause of blindness in developed countries. There are no current treatments for the most common form of AMD, known as “dry” AMD, which accounts for 85-90% of cases. Both in “dry” and “wet” AMD forms, chronic inflammation is central for promoting the degenerative process. Thus, GLP-1RAs present a potential therapeutic option for AMD.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (age related macular degeneration)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to build a cohort of patients with diabetes aged 40 and older, with no prior AMD diagnosis. We will develop concept sets and extract data on the primary outcome, i.e. diagnosis of AMD identified using EHR data, and primary predictor, i.e.  treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) prior to primary outcome.  Analyses will be performed in R notebooks within the All of Us Workbench environment.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to see an association between treatment with GLP-1RAs and risk of AMD. There are no current treatments for the most common form of AMD, known as “dry” AMD, which accounts for 85-90% of cases. In both “dry” and “wet” AMD forms, chronic inflammation is central for promoting the degenerative process.

1.	Which variants in our genome influence our weight ?
2.	How do the genetic variants we find relate to genes – do they directly alter the gene and its encoded protein ?, or do they act by switching genes on or off at different times and in different cells and tissues ?
3.	How do the genetic variants we find influence weight ? do they alter how we grow in childhood ?, the speed at which we put on weight ?, in which parts of the body we put excess weight ? how we respond to weight loss interventions ?
4.	How do the genetic variants we find help us understand the consequences of excess weight ? Can we use them to find out why people may develop obesity related conditions such as metabolic diseases (e.g. Type 2 diabetes, heart disease) , cancers and musculoskeletal conditions?
5.	Do the genetic variants we find and their links to excess weight and its consequences differ between groups of people from different broad genetic ancestry groups ?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (obesity)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
1.	Carefully curate the genetic and health related information that is linked to the AllofUS participants to ensure we are analysing only high quality data.2
2.	Select all AllofUS participants, and stratify them by their broad genetic ancestry.
3.	Use the latest genetic approaches to link genetic variation to weight related measures and characteristics. These characteristics will include height, weight, measures of weight change, electronic medical records of aspects of health related to weight – for example, weight loss after therapy, excess fat in the liver from medical images.
4.	Use the genetic information we have generated in steps 1-3 to understand the consequences of excess weight on health. We will use approaches such as “Mendelian randomisation”, a method that can help inform clinical trials. We will test genetic variants for their effects on many weight-related conditions, including cancer, Musculo-skeletal disease and metabolic diseases.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the following findings:
1.	New knowledge about the genetic variants that influence weight, including those involved in growth, excess weight and changes in weight.
2.	New knowledge about how genetic variants influence weight. For example, through the brain, fat, muscle, circulating factors, or other mechanisms.
3.	New knowledge about the role of excess weight and different types of excess weight in health and disease
4.	Improved understanding of differences in the effects of excess weight on health between people from different genetic backgrounds. This is important because we know that, for a given Body Mass Index, people of Asian and African genetic ancestry, for example, have a higher risk of obesity-related conditions compared to people of European genetic ancestry.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Lifespan diabetes and diabetes complications)","Scientific Approaches
To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations.  Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for many other complex diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of several complications including peripheral neuropathy. In addition to hyperglycemia, multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of other metabolic syndrome risk factors, particularly obesity, increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Given the evidence liking obesity to peripheral neuropathy, interventions that target metabolic risk factors are likely needed to prevent or reverse neuropathy. However, the appropriate intensity and timing of these interventions to prevent peripheral neuropathy remain unknown. A better understanding of how metabolic risk factors, physical activity level, and other lifestyle factors are associated with, and predictive of neuropathy, would inform the future disease modifying therapies. We aim to determine and compare associations between metabolic risk factors, physical activity levels and other lifestyle factors of PN.","Project Purpose(s)

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) face a disproportionate risk for chronic non-AIDS-related morbidities, including adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several studies have postulated cART toxicities as contributors to this health disparity. In this research project, we aim to investigate the effect of dolutegravir (DTG) on the risk of gestational diabetes.  Case reports have identified an association of DTG with hyperglycemia and new-onset type 2 diabetes in PLWH. This research project will improve our understanding of the metabolic effects of DTG during pregnancy. Specific questions we will ask are (1) Is there a difference in the incidence of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based vs non-DTG-based regimens?; (2) What are the effective predictors for barriers to prenatal care access related to oral glucose tolerance testing?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cART-suppressed HIV; Gestational Diabetes)","Scientific Approaches
We will apply computational methods to (1) Retrieve the incidence rates of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based vs non-DTG-based regimens; (2) Assess the influence of the length of DTG-based treatment time on the level of glucose dysregulation; (3) Identify predictors for barriers to prenatal care access related to oral glucose tolerance testing within different clinical settings (e.g., rural, urban, safety-net hospital, etc.).","Anticipated Findings
For this research project, we expect to identify metabolic differences related to glucose regulation for HIV+ pregnant women on different cART regimens. We hypothesize that the DTG-associated risk for hyperglycemia and diabetes observed in PLWH will similarly impact HIV+ pregnant women. We expect to find (1) An increased incidence of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based as opposed to non-DTG-based regimens; (2) A positive correlation between the level of glucose dysregulation and the length of time on the DTG-based regimen; (3) Predictors that impede prenatal care access specific to oral glucose tolerance testing within different clinical settings (e.g., rural, urban, safety-net hospital, etc.).","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to assess risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to allow identification of at-risk individuals of all minoritized groups for prevention. We aim to assess metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity among minoritized groups and if patterns of severity are different between sub-groups, to derive separate severity scores by group. We will further assess roles of SDOH in worsening severity between groups and evaluate long-term risk prediction for future CVD—all with the goal of providing detailed guidance for researchers and healthcare providers for CVD preventative care.
To these ends, we aim to answer the following questions:
-	Are there differences in MetS manifestation among marginalized groups?
-	If there are differences, how do severity scores derived within a group compare to those previously derived?
-	What are the relationships between MetS severity and SDOH?
-	Are there differences in CVD or T2D outcomes longitudinally by group?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Using the Controlled level v7 data to access EHR data from each participant, we will use confirmatory factor analysis of MetS components among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender sub-groups and assess how these differ from prior estimates, deriving group-specific MetS z-scores. Sub-groups will be assessed for differences in correlations between SDOH data and MetS severity. Finally, we will assess CVD and T2D, including new diagnosis and mortality relative to MetS z-scores at multiple time points.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that MetS manifests differently among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender subgroups, warranting derivation of separate MetS-Z scores to guide identification and treatment for MetS-related risk. We further hypothesize that a large portion of this risk is related to SDOH burden in minoritized groups. In all sub-groups, we expect that higher scores will predict new disease outcomes. Deriving MetS-Z scores for each sub-group would enable more specific clinical assessment of future disease risk by sub-group. Identification of relationships between MetS severity, SDOH, and CVD outcomes would highlight the medical harm of experienced discrimination and could help in risk stratification for groups not normally seen as having elevated CVD risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Type 2 diabetes is linked to a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular complications. To minimize the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events, it is important to closely regulate blood sugar levels through different glycemic control treatments. However, this approach may also increase the chance of mortality, thus creating a potential trade-off. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of different glycemic control can vary among individuals, implying that genetic factors might influence its cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. The Aim of this study is to identify genetic determinants associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases in individuals with type 2 diabetes who are undergoing different glycemic control treatments.","Project Purpose(s)

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is occurring at an increasing frequency in adolescents and young adults, resulting in severe complications such as kidney, eye, and nerve disease in early adulthood. The proposed research will leverage the National Institutes of Health-supported All of Us Research Program, one of the most diverse health databases in history, to identify and define clustering's of social risk factors that are associated with higher risk of T2D, or its precursor “prediabetes,” in young adults. Although several individual social determinants of health (SDOH) are known to impact diabetes risk, the detailed SDOH that is prospectively collected by All of Us is an unparalleled tool that has not yet been leveraged to evaluate the combined and interactive effect of SDOH on diabetes risk in young adults. This work will serve as preliminary data to develop targeted interventions that address the SDOH that are most strongly associated with diabetes risk in young people.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Type 2 Diabetes)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The research team will use the NIH All of Us Research Program dataset to develop a retrospective cohort of individuals ages 18-34 years (young adults) without type 1 diabetes. Using this cohort, the team will pair physical measurement data and Fitbit data, electronic health record data, and survey-based measures of social determinants of health (SDOH) and lifestyle to characterize the association between interpersonal SDOH (e.g., social support, discrimination and disrespect), built environment and neighborhood safety, economic stability, and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in young adulthood. The team will perform Latent Class Analysis and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders to identify clusters of social risk factors that are associated with prediabetes or T2D prevalence or frequency of risk reducing behaviors.","Anticipated Findings
The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that a phenotype of interpersonal social determinants of health, including poor social bonds and greater experience of discrimination, will be present more often in young adults with prediabetes and T2D than in demographically similar peers without prediabetes or T2D. The team also hypothesizes that interpersonal relationships will be associated with engagement in risk-reducing behaviors. Knowledge of the most important social risk factors, which are potentially modifiable, could ultimately help to reduce risk of diabetes in young people by guiding intervention development. As social risk factors also contribute to outcomes for other health conditions beyond diabetes, this work could be leveraged to address other diseases impacting young adults, especially those most vulnerable.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Previous genetic studies have successfully identified >240 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many of the identified loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome, masking the underlying “effector gene”. Additionally, these studies were primarily performed in individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. As genetic findings are integrated into the clinic, this limited genetic understanding threatens to exacerbate existing health disparities among non-European communities disproportionately suffering from T2D and T2D-related health complications. Expanding our genetic understanding into non-European ancestries is essential as these studies will mitigate such health disparities and improve our ability to identify causal loci and mechanisms. In this study, I will leverage the diversity found within All of Us to perform a trans-ancestry genetic analysis of T2D, identifying likely causal variants and evaluating their potential for clinical utility.","Project Purpose(s)

Using well-established techniques in statistical genetics, I will (1) conduct a genome wide association study of common variants, as well as other forms of genetic variation (e.g., rare variants, copy number variations), to identify trans-ancestry and ancestry-specific disease-associated loci, (2) use statistical and functional fine-mapping techniques to identify the likely causal variants at disease-associated loci, validating my findings with experimental approaches, and (3) evaluate the clinical utility of my findings through polygenic scores (PGSs) and screening for potential targets of drug repurposing. For these analyses, I will use all participants with genetic data (whole genome and SNP-array). I will develop a phenotypic algorithm to classify participants into T2D cases and controls based on previously published work in electronic health records.","Anticipated Findings
Genetic studies of T2D have already provided valuable insight into disease pathophysiology. However, the vast majority of these studies have been performed in European and East Asian ancestries, threatening to exacerbate existing health disparities in populations carrying a disproportionate disease burden as genetics enters the clinic through preventative and therapeutic interventions. In the present study, I aim to address these shortcomings by leveraging the diversity found within All of Us to expand our genetic understanding of T2D. Based on the prior success of similar studies, I expect to identify many rare and common T2D-associated loci that are shared across ancestries as well as ancestry-specific. Combined with experimental and computational approaches, I will use these results to identify variants that are likely causal for T2D, propose the mechanism by which these variants contribute to T2D risk, and propose ways to translate my findings into clinical intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are hoping to access information about the diabetic status of patients (Type I vs Type II diabetes, where applicable) and access information about whether patients have Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) or Primary Cicatricial alopecia (PCA). Essentially, we are trying to determine the incidence of HS or PCA in Type I vs Type II diabetics. I don't believe we need the data to have identifiers.","Project Purpose(s)

Information on Primary cicatricial alopecia (PCA) and Hidradenitis supparativa (HS)","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings include identifying a potential relationship between the presence of diabetes and the incidence of primary cicatricial alopecia (PCA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). They are trying to determine whether HS or PCA tends to be correlated with the presence of diabetes, and whether there is a difference between Type I vs Type II diabetes. If we found a correlation, this could make a significant difference in the management of the diseases if there is a metabolic predisposition present in the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest
