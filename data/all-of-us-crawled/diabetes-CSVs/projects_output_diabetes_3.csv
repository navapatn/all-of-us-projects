Understand and address health disparities between Hispanics living in Puerto Rico and those living on the mainland USA, explicitly examining the differences in chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Additionally, how sociodemographic factors, such as employment, income, and education, influence mental health, quality of life, and overall health. This is essential for crafting targeted interventions and policies to enhance the health outcomes of Hispanics. Socioeconomic disparities contribute to unequal healthcare access, variations in health behaviors and healthcare outcomes. Investigating these relationships yields evidence-based insights to inform public health strategies, and health policy development to mitigate health disparities.
These insights can guide future research, healthcare initiatives, and interventions, and enhance the health and well-being of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic populations across the United States.","Project Purpose(s)

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease. Thus, the purpose of this workspace is  to develop internal methods for examining the association between polygenic risk scores of unique intermediate phenotypes derived in diverse  population based cohorts, and overt cardiometabolic disease within All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will leverage whole genome sequencing data from multiple, diverse, population based cohorts to derive polygenic risk scores for a variety of novel phenotypes using multiple methods such as: clumping/pruning and thresholding (PRSice), LDpred2, and PRS-CS. Validated scores will then be constructed for each All of Us participant and the association between polygenic risk and cardiometabolic diseases will be examined.","Anticipated Findings
The current workbench serves as a first step toward identifying novel pathways linking intermediate phenotypes available in our diverse population based cohorts to cardiometabolic disease risk in All of Us. Furthermore, there is considerable interest in developing and validating polygenic risk scores in diverse populations to shrink gaps in clinical care across ethnic and socioeconomic groups. We aim to work toward precision medicine that is applicable to all populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Arab-Americans experience similar barriers in healthcare access as other ethnic minorities in the US, and tend to have worse health outcomes than caucasian patients.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.  This resource will initially be used by the eMERGE IV consortium, which is an NIH-funded consortium of clinical centers across the United States, with an aim to enroll a prospective cohort of 25,000 individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

Metabolic diseases are a global epidemic. They occur when cells allocate too many of their primary resources towards one pathway, such as lipid production, at the expense of other crucial pathways, such as energy production. Understanding how cells control the pivotal point of allocating glucose towards lipid or energy production is key to developing effective treatments for these and other common metabolic diseases. PAS kinase (PASK) is a nutrient sensing protein kinase that regulates this critical metabolic node of lipid versus respiratory metabolism. PASK controls many of the hallmark pathways associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative disease yet little is known about PASK alleles associated with human disease. Herein we propose to conduct the first large-scale analysis to identify PASK alleles associated with human disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We target PASK as well as two of its substrates for our study.  Due to their regulation of the critical node of glucose partitioning to lipid versus respiratory metabolism, we propose to uncover the influence of PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on a variety of human phenotypes and classes of disease, from hyperlipidemia and diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders using the All of Us dataset.
In addition to the wide variety of phenotypic data that will aid in understanding the influence of variation in cellular respiration and triglyceride levels, the ancestral diversity represented by the individuals in the dataset will allow us to identify patterns and variants that differ or are similar across ancestry, defining effects common to humankind while opening further studies on multigene, secondary variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes is challenging to manage and requires lifelong self-regulation behaviors to prevent debilitating complications. Perceived discrimination could directly heighten stress response and impact individuals’ mental and physical health outcomes. However, previous studies show inconsistency in the influences of anxiety on diabetes outcomes. Social support has been linked to patients’ mortality rate and reported as deemed positive or buffering when it was related to a reduced impact of perceived discrimination on negative health. Thus, our research questions are: 1 Does perceived discrimination impact diabetes subjective and clinical outcomes? 2 What is the role of anxiety between perceived discrimination and diabetes outcomes? 3 Does social support moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and diabetes outcomes?4 Does social support moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and anxiety and further influence the effects of anxiety on diabetes outcomes?","Project Purpose(s)

For RQ1.1, hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis will be conducted to examine the impact of discrimination in medical settings on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.2, a correlation coefficient analysis will be used to examine relationships among study variables. A moderation analysis will be conducted to examine the role of Anxiety in the relationship between discrimination and diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.3. A moderation analysis will be conducted to examine if social support moderates the effect of discrimination on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.4.  Moderation analyses will be conducted to examine if social support moderates the effect of discrimination on anxiety and the effect of anxiety on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
All the analyses will control for demographics and physical health factors.","Anticipated Findings
This study aims to examine the direct effects of perceived discrimination in medical settings on the diabetes care outcomes, and the indirect effects of perceived discrimination in medical settings on the diabetes care outcomes through anxiety after controlling for demographics and individuals’ physical conditions. Social support has been previously reported as a significant factor associated with self-management outcomes among people with chronic health conditions. We hypothesize that social support will moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and diabetes care outcomes, and social support will also moderate the effect of discrimination on anxiety and further decreases the effects of anxiety on health outcomes. We expect the results from this study to provide meaningful information to healthcare professionals regarding the impact of discrimination in medical care settings on patients’ health, and if social support could moderate the effects of said discrimination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will first examine the summary statistics of HS patients in the All of Us dataset and perform data cleaning as necessary on HS and relevant covariates (age, body mass index, sex, smoking status, self-reported race, and genetic ancestry). We plan to include all participants with HS as well as appropriate controls in All of Us who do not report HS. Depending on covariate distribution, we may perform stratified analyses using matched controls.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.  This resource will initially be used by the eMERGE IV consortium, which is an NIH-funded consortium of clinical centers across the United States, with an aim to enroll a prospective cohort of 25,000 individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

Arrays will be imputed using the phasing and imputation tools Eagle2 and Minimac4.  Polygenic risk score will then be calculated using the population genomics tool PLINK.  A simple linear model will then be fit to the scores, which attempt to describe the macroscopic relationship between genetic ancestry and observed polygenic scores.  The fitted parameters of this model can then be used to reduce genetic ancestry-dependent bias when calculating these scores in a clinical setting.","Anticipated Findings

Lupus is an autoimmune disease when the body's immune system attacks its tissues and organs, causing widespread inflammation - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus became a global pandemic, and while there were many named co-morbidities- such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer, however, there was very little information about the association of COVID-19 and Lupus. Vaccines are well-studied medications to reduce and have even eliminated many diseases in the national population. As Lupus is an autoimmune disease, most medical professionals encourage their patients to get at least one of the available vaccines. Still, many African Americans, even those without Lupus, hesitated to get a vaccine. This study looks at the impact of Covid-19 infections on those diagnosed with Lupus and attitudes surrounding available vaccines.","Project Purpose(s)

Scientific Question: How do patterns of physical activity and dietary habits influence the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in urban areas? Why are some urban areas more affected than others, even with similar socio-economic backgrounds?
Importance: Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern, especially in urban areas. Understanding the relationship between lifestyle habits, such as physical activity and diet, and the prevalence of this disease is crucial. By identifying key factors in specific urban regions, we can design better public health interventions and policies. This will not only help in managing the disease but also in preventing its onset in at-risk populations. The significance of this research transcends the realm of science and directly impacts community health, potential healthcare costs, and overall quality of life.","Project Purpose(s)

1. Data Collection:
Datasets: We will utilize the AoU data, which offers comprehensive information on individual health records, including details on physical activity, dietary habits, and diabetes status. It's crucial to ensure that the dataset includes demographic details like age, gender, socio-economic status, and geographical location, as these can act as confounding variables.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Previous studies have been able to map variations in medication administration and treatment decisions in conditions like Type 2 Diabetes and substance abuse disorder. Similar to contraception, there are many options for the treatment of high blood sugar and substance use and may be a complex decision-making process between personal and provider preferences. No currently published work has mapped the contraception decisions of an individual over time. Our goal is to quantify the variation in contraception prescriptions for individuals in the All of Us Research Program dataset.
The overall objective of this project is to understand contraception prescription patterns in individuals who identify as female within the All of Us dataset.
(1) What are the most prevalent types of contraception? (2) Has there been a change in the percentages of participants who were prescribed a particular contraceptive? (3) What are the most common sequences of contraceptive prescriptions?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective, longitudinal analysis will be conducted using the All of Us Research Program dataset to identify contraceptive prescribing patterns for individuals who identify as female in the United States. First, we will use the Cohort Builder within the workbench to identify all eligible adult participants (≥18 years of age) who identify as female. We will then limit the cohort to just individuals who have a medication record of at least one contraceptive including, birth control pills (e.g., Microgestin), IUDs (e.g., Levonorgestrel [Mirena]), implants (e.g., Etonogestrel [Nexplanon]), and injections (e.g., Depo-Provera). We will use Python within the All of Us Researcher Workbench to complete the study objectives.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that we will be able to complete the study objectives within the timeframe of the summer. Overall, the anticipated results of the project will have a significant positive impact on the field of contraception research and ultimately improve the quality of care for individuals seeking contraception. In the long term, we expect to develop predictive models that can help healthcare providers identify the most effective contraceptive methods for individual patients based on their characteristics and preferences. More excitingly, we are looking forward to the project that will conduct and provide some educational resources which help individuals and healthcare providers make decisions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Datasets: Fitbit accelerometry data; data regarding diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, blood glucose metrics, cholesterol metrics, and blood pressure.
Methods: We will use machine learning and statistical analysis methods for time-series data for this task
Tools: Python and R programming language, and relevant data analysis packages in these languages.","Anticipated Findings
Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

There are 37.3 million people living with diabetes in the United States. The prevalence of diabetes among non-Hispanic Blacks is 11.7% compared to 7.5% among non-Hispanic Whites.  Non-Hispanic Blacks are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and twice as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to die from diabetes. While socioeconomic status does play a role in the prevalence of diabetes, it's important to note that the relationship between income and diabetes prevalence is complex and influenced by many factors. Research has shown that diabetes prevalence is generally higher among individuals with lower income.  However, little is known about the impact and prevalence of type 2 diabetes among middle-class non- Hispanic Blacks.","Project Purpose(s)

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 1000 genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, and these results have started to be used for applications with potential clinical use, such as polygenic risk scores (PRS) intended to predict the development of the disease. However, Latino ancestry has been historically underrepresented, as most GWAS have been developed within European ancestries. Besides delaying the discovery of the genetic regions associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in Latino populations, it has also compromised the performance of  PRS and exaggerated health disparities across ancestries.

Given the richness of diversity and data availability in the All of Us data, we anticipate it to be an ideal cohort to test the performance of the PRSs. This will allow us to develop an improved PRS appropriate for the continuum of diversity of Latino populations.

In this study, we aim to explore the genetic variants and other environmental and lifestyle risk factors that are associated with diabetic neuropathy.
Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a nerve damage that occurs in diabetic patients. This is due to the inability of the body to produce insulin, which metabolizes glucose in the body, and excess glucose in the blood leads to nerve damage and other complications. Prior studies have shown the relationship between DN and higher hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, age, longer duration of type 1 diabetes, male sex, greater height, higher weight, low physical activity, higher pulse rate, family history of type 2 diabetes, lower HDL cholesterol, higher total cholesterol, medication use, obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, etc.

Wearable devices such as Fitbit and Apple Watch have been available for many years, tracking information such as steps, activity, heart rate, and sleep.  While as patients and consumers we find this information useful in managing our general fitness, the data captured by these devices may have associations with important medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  In some cases, wearable device data can be uploaded to our personal physicians through patient portals such as MyChart, however it remains unclear how this information can and should be utilized by medical providers.  In this study, we hope to explore the associations between wearable device metrics, including steps, heart rate, activity, and sleep, with medical outcomes such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity.  Associations between wearable device data and diagnoses of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease will also be explored.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Other Purpose (Class project for a graduate course in Biomedical Data Analysis)","Scientific Approaches
We will be utilizing the following datasets from the All of Us Research Program: demographics, physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference), EHR data (laboratory, diagnoses, vital signs), and of course wearable device data (heart rate, steps, sleep, and activity).  This will primarily be an exploratory data analysis to determine if the data is robust enough for more advanced predictive modeling.  We will utilize primarily descriptive statistics and regression through Python 3.11.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify useful associations between wearable device metrics, such as activity and sleep, and the onset of clinical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease.  Nevertheless, given the limitations of wearable devices, it's also possible that no relationships will be identified.  We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels of daily activity and sleep are less likely to develop these clinical conditions.  The preliminary results of this study could inform future studies to model individual risk based on the data recorded from personal wearable devices.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 10% of the world's population will have diabetes by 2035. Patients living with diabetes are at higher risk for many acute and chronic complications, which may lead to increased hospital or ED visits. Accurate subtyping of those with type 2 diabetes is crucial to understand what characteristics of patients lead to increased risk of adverse outcomes, and is key to more effective and targeted treatments of diabetes and its complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will make use of a machine learning method called Deep Metric Learning (DML). DML seeks to learn a representation of the patient's state by maximizing its similarity with other patients with the same label. DML has previously been shown to be effective in subtyping several diseases in the medical imaging domain. However, DML has not been widely used on Electronic Health Records (EHR) and genetic data. Here, we propose using DML to learn subtypes for type 2 diabetes using time-series data from the EHR, as well as survey and genetic data.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that the DML representations we learn will form natural clusters corresponding to patient subtypes. We anticipate that patients in particular subtypes will exhibit similarities based on their input features (i.e. demographics, labs, vitals, surveys, or genetics). Patients in different subtypes may also have different outcomes (i.e. # hospital visits, complications, mortality). We believe that characterizing such subtypes will be useful for clinicians to provide targeted treatments to different patients, which may improve health outcomes. Characterizing such subtypes may also be useful in more accurate diagnosis of diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The escalating burden of severe obesity in women of reproductive age has driven a growing utilization of weight loss surgery (WLS) in this population. Despite benefits such as reduced incidence of gestational diabetes, a pregnancy after WLS is considered high-risk given the elevated rate of various adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, there have been serious concerns about the negative impact of WLS on maternal mental health, particularly related to depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality. These mental disorders increase the risk for severe maternal morbidity by 50% and are the leading cause of maternal mortality.
We propose to use All of Us data to accomplish two specific aims. Aim 1 Determine the individual and composite prevalence of depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality in pregnant women post-WLS. Aim 2 Examine the association of composite mental disorders with severe maternal morbidity post-WLS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
For Aim 1, we will use t-test to compare the prevalence of mental disorders between pregnant women post-WLS and comparison groups. For Aim 2, we will apply logistic regression to examine the association between mental disorders and severe maternal morbidity, adjusting for factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and pregnancy complications.","Anticipated Findings
This study is of clinical significance because the findings will aid clinicians in offering more informed counseling regarding the risk-benefit profiles of preconception WLS. Also, this study carries policy relevance. Current policies aiming to enhance perinatal mental health care mainly target traditional high-risk groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status. This study will raise awareness about the mental health burden faced by women conceiving post-WLS, supporting future advocacy for the inclusion of their needs into policy formulation. Moreover, while national guidelines for post-WLS pregnancy management have been published, mental health was a missing piece. This study can, therefore, foster efforts to develop more inclusive guidelines that incorporate mental health aspects, to optimize maternal care post-WLS.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It is currently known that young adults of black and Hispanic descent tend to have poorer health outcomes than their white counterparts in managing a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, involving higher HbA1c levels over time, less use of diabetes technology, and poorer self-reported measures of management at home. Additionally, individuals of black and Hispanic descent are at an increased risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the onset of diagnosis, which is associated with lower glycemic control over time and poorer health outcomes. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that sufficient genetic screenings be implemented so that type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed asymptomatically. The question that arises is whether or not these screenings are readily accessible to individuals who are at an increased risk. Given that early diagnoses are associated with better health outcomes, this study aims to explore the association between race, age of diagnosis, and health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Juvenile Diabetes)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The first dataset will be individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes as confirmed by mention in the medical records. I will exclude individuals who presented with DKA, as DKA is associated with a lower age of diagnosis upon onset and may present a confound. I seek to explore confirmed diagnoses before the onset of life-threatening illnesses, such as DKA.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that individuals of black and  Hispanic descent will be diagnosed with T1D at an older age due to various factors such as generalized mistrust within the healthcare system and less access to reliable healthcare. This will further indicate who is currently most at risk and will allow for public health efforts to create targeted initiatives to increase the accessibility of screenings in those communities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Liver disease was the #10 cause of death in the United States in 2022. Risk factors for advanced liver disease include viral hepatitis infection, excess alcohol use, and components of the metabolic syndrome including diabetes. However,  we have only limited ability to predict who is at highest risk of developing advanced liver disease and, therefore, how to prevent advanced disease. We aim to identify predictive models for advanced liver disease incorporating genetics, demographics, behaviors, lived environment, medical comorbidities, laboratory values, and other predictors. We are also interested in looking at population attributable fraction for different risk factors (metabolic comorbidities, genetics, lived environment, and behaviors including alcohol intake and substance use) across different populations including race and geography.","Project Purpose(s)

We hope to identify novel predictors of advanced liver disease (environmental, behavior, genetic, etc) and interactions between different risk factors (e.g., between genetic risk and certain behaviors).

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease. Thus, the purpose of this workspace is  to develop internal methods for examining the association between polygenic risk scores of unique intermediate phenotypes derived in diverse  population based cohorts, and overt cardiometabolic disease within All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)

The purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the response to antidepressants for patients with bipolar depression using data from AllOfUs.  The project aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the optimal use of antidepressants in this population and to identify any potential relationship between diabetes and depression.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
This is a retrospective, observational, matched case control study of depressed patients treated with antidepressants. Cases were patients who took a specific antidepressant and controls took other antidepressants. The study examined the performance of one antidepressant against others. The study does not determine if the patient should take antidepressants. Instead, for patients whose clinician has prescribed, or will prescribe, an antidepressant, the study clarifies which one has the highest evidence of remission. In this observational study, we will  statistically control for observed confounding and selection bias. The study will focus on confounding by indication.  Confounding by indication means that a comorbidity, procedure, or medication (all measured in the year prior to taking the antidepressant) is associated with selection of the antidepressant and/or the remission outcome.","Anticipated Findings
This study intends to improved accuracy of clinical decision aids by examining effectiveness of antidepressants after statistically removing observed confounding/selection bias in the data.  To remove bias, the study will identified features of patients’ medical history that either predicted remission or affected prescription of antidepressants.  This study summarizes experience of remission for cases that fell within each subgroup.  This study intends to optimize antidepressant recommendations based on which subgroup matches patients’ medical history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How does the prevalence and incidence of diabetes vary across different racial and ethnic groups, and what underlying factors contribute to these disparities? What role do genetic factors play in the development and progression of diabetes among various racial groups, and how do these interactions relate to other risk factors? How does access to healthcare services, including quality of care and diabetes education, influence racial disparities in diabetes management, complications, and mortality rates? How does the impact of diabetes on cardiovascular health and other complications differ among racial and age groups, and what potential mechanisms contribute to these disparities? Are there racial differences in the effectiveness and safety of various diabetes medications and treatment approaches, and if so, what underlying factors might be responsible? These questions are important to research because it would help create more specialized healthcare for those who need it.","Project Purpose(s)

•	Data elements of interest include primary language spoken at home, education level, food and housing instability, perceived social support, perceived neighborhood safety, subjective experience of discrimination based on or presence of 2 or more obesity related comorbidities","Anticipated Findings
We conducted an earlier retrospective cohort study on TriNetX over 83 million patients, which showed lower GLP-1 RA prescriptions in the Latinx population, and higher rates of prescription in White, Black, Female and patients with larger amounts of obesity-related comorbidities. Other recent studies on cohorts with diabetes have found similarly lower prescription trends of GLP-1 RA's and SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-white persons (doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.13885).
We anticipate finding similar demographic differences in this study.

Metabolic diseases are a global epidemic. They occur when cells allocate too many of their primary resources towards one pathway, such as lipid production, at the expense of other crucial pathways, such as energy production. Understanding how cells control the pivotal point of allocating glucose towards lipid or energy production is key to developing effective treatments for these and other common metabolic diseases. PAS kinase (PASK) is a nutrient sensing protein kinase that regulates this critical metabolic node of lipid versus respiratory metabolism. PASK controls many of the hallmark pathways associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative disease yet little is known about PASK alleles associated with human disease. Herein we propose to conduct the first large-scale analysis to identify PASK alleles associated with human disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Analyze common and rare variants in USF1, ATXN2, and PASK compared to triglycerides, weight, cardiovascular measures, exercise levels and COVID-19 results.
Perform a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with common and rare variants in USF1, ATXN2, and PASK. Common variants in each of these three genes will be regressed against phenotypes from electronic health record data.","Anticipated Findings
We target PASK as well as two of its substrates for our study.  Due to their regulation of the critical node of glucose partitioning to lipid versus respiratory metabolism, we propose to uncover the influence of PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on a variety of human phenotypes and classes of disease, from hyperlipidemia and diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders using the All of Us dataset.
In addition to the wide variety of phenotypic data that will aid in understanding the influence of variation in cellular respiration and triglyceride levels, the ancestral diversity represented by the individuals in the dataset will allow us to identify patterns and variants that differ or are similar across ancestry, defining effects common to humankind while opening further studies on multigene, secondary variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It has been estimated that 10.2% of the global population will have diabetes by 2030.  PRS combined with non-genetic predictors potentially holds utility for identifying individuals at high risk prior to disease onset, motivating positive health behavior change or repeated screening for those at high risk, or even guiding therapeutic interventions. The All of Us Research Program is uniquely situated to address these questions and identify opportunities for tailoring prediction across multi-ancestry populations.
Our primary study question is to investigate whether a multi-ancestry T2D PRS will be associated with T2D-related phenotypic risk factors and complications across diverse populations. In particular, we hypothesize that the T2D PRS may help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. Our secondary study question will investigate whether the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D risk is mediated by T2D risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will construct a multi-ancestry T2D PRS based on a large multi-ancestry T2D GWAS meta-analysis. We will also construct a PRS based on a recent T2D GWAS meta-analysis that includes a larger number of non-European ancestry individuals. In addition, we will evaluate a genome-wide PRS using recent approaches such as LDPred2, PRS-CSx, and others.
For our primary study question, in analyses stratified by T2D status, we will evaluate the association between the T2D PRS and the T2D-related risk factors and complications using regression models. For our secondary study question, we will evaluate whether the T2D risk factors mediate the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D status. This will be performed using regression models to assess the relationship between 1) the PRS and T2D risk, 2) the PRS and the T2D risk factor, 3) the T2D risk factor and T2D risk, and 4) the PRS and T2D risk while adjusting for the T2D risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that our T2D PRS may hold prognostic value and help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. We anticipate that the effectiveness of T2D PRS is context-dependent. The T2D PRS may perform well in predicting T2D risk for diverse populations and may hold potential prognostic value for prediabetes and T2D controls.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.  There is, however, a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals.
We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes).  We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.  This resource will initially be used by the eMERGE IV consortium, which is an NIH-funded consortium of clinical centers across the United States, with an aim to enroll a prospective cohort of 25,000 individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

A simple linear model will then be fit to the scores, which attempt to describe the macroscopic relationship between genetic ancestry and observed polygenic scores.  The fitted parameters of this model can then be used to reduce genetic ancestry-dependent bias when calculating these scores in a clinical setting.","Anticipated Findings

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of bacterial contribution to the development of vascular disease and identify factors that lead to dysbiosis. We will examine oral and blood pathobiont composition and look for social determinants that affect the microbiome composition, such as smoking history, diabetes, urban/rural setting, etc. We will also look for microbial signatures that influence the type of vascular disease a patient develops (ie, is there a difference between patients with atherosclerotic disease and aneurysmal disease. Is there a difference between patients with different locations of occlusive disease). Our central hypothesis is that bacteria within the mouth and in the blood create small molecules that contribute to the development of vascular disease and different microbial signatures may influence the type of disease a patient develops.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Academic Research - Data will be used to explore questions related to the oral and blood microbiome in vascular surgery patients with the possibility of publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.)","Scientific Approaches
We would like to explore the ability to extract bacterial DNA from human DNA sequencing data. We would align these reads to databases of known bacteria and assess for social determinants that alter the microbiome composition and contribute to vascular disease. We would also look for differences in the microbiome composition between patients with different vascular diseases.","Anticipated Findings
Changes in oral microbial composition have been associated with atherosclerotic disease; however, the factors that impact these changes are debated. Additionally, there have not been reports decerning differences between patients with different types of vascular disease, such as occlusive disease and aneurysmal disease. We expect to identify a difference between patients with these types of diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize that we can reduce the gap in the performance of PRSs between diverse populations by developing methods to generate PRSs for populations of diverse ancestry. All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program. We will meta-analyze the available genotype data along with similar data from dbGaP and additional datasets to improve performance of PRSs in African American, Latino, and Asian populations.","Project Purpose(s)

To generate PRSs for diverse ancestries, we will use data from the eMERGE consortium, 1000 Genomes, the All of Us (AoU) program, dbGaP, PRIMED consortium sites, the UK Biobank, and collaborations with several international groups representing Middle Eastern, South Asian, and East Asian cohorts. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Integrate and harmonize data from heterogeneous sources to enable cross platform phenotyping and generation of PRSs for common diseases in diverse ancestry groups. Aim 2. Develop PRSs for CHD and its major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia) in populations of diverse ancestry. Aim 3. Develop novel statistical and computational methods to account for diverse genetic ancestry (using the AADR) and admixture in models of polygenic risk. Aim 4. Develop ‘clinic ready’ PRSs for diverse ancestry groups by creating reference distributions of a CHD PRS and integrate it with clinical information to compute absolute risk estimates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that increasing representation of diverse populations in genotyped datasets will enable the generation of more robust PRSs in these populations. We expect to advance PRS methodology for diverse populations and use novel population genetics approaches.

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Lifespan diabetes and diabetes complications)","Scientific Approaches
To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations. Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for many other complex diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It has been estimated that 10.2% of the global population will have diabetes by 2030.  PRS combined with non-genetic predictors potentially holds utility for identifying individuals at high risk prior to disease onset, motivating positive health behavior change or repeated screening for those at high risk, or even guiding therapeutic interventions. The All of Us Research Program is uniquely situated to address these questions and identify opportunities for tailoring prediction across multi-ancestry populations.
Our primary study question is to investigate whether a multi-ancestry T2D PRS will be associated with T2D-related phenotypic risk factors and complications across diverse populations. In particular, we hypothesize that the T2D PRS may help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. Our secondary study question will investigate whether the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D risk is mediated by T2D risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

In addition, we will evaluate a genome-wide PRS using recent approaches such as LDPred2, PRS-CSx, and others.
For our primary study question, in analyses stratified by T2D status, we will evaluate the association between the T2D PRS and the T2D-related risk factors and complications using regression models. For our secondary study question, we will evaluate whether the T2D risk factors mediate the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D status. This will be performed using regression models to assess the relationship between 1) the PRS and T2D risk, 2) the PRS and the T2D risk factor, 3) the T2D risk factor and T2D risk, and 4) the PRS and T2D risk while adjusting for the T2D risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that our T2D PRS may hold prognostic value and help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. We anticipate that the effectiveness of T2D PRS is context-dependent. The T2D PRS may perform well in predicting T2D risk for diverse populations and may hold potential prognostic value for prediabetes and T2D controls.","Demographic Categories of Interest

There is a complex relationship between mental and metabolic health, especially in the context of antipsychotic medications and their side effects. Schizophrenia is a very rare psychiatric disorder, yet the medications prescribed for individuals with this disorder have some of the strongest and most adverse metabolic side effects, ranging from rapid weight gain to dysregulation of blood glucose. But what happens if individuals taking certain antipsychotics begin to experience increased A1C and weight gain, common indicators of an increased type 2 diabetes risk? Do these individuals receive standard medical care for diabetes management? How do social and economic factors influence diagnosis, symptom management, and choice of medication?

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications including preventative medicine.

The correlation between blood glucose levels in diabetes patients and kidney function can help estimate the risk for kidney failure and support preventive methods to significantly reduce the cost of healthcare for underrepresented populations of older adults aged 65-74 and 75+.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
(1) Inferential and descriptive statistical methods. (2) Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. (R/Python)","Anticipated Findings
Using inferential statistics methods and machine learning models can support the significance of the association between kidney function biomarkers and chronic hyperglycemia (e.g., Glycated hemoglobin - HbA1C) with adverse events such as kidney failure. Different organs in human body are tightly working with one another and disturbance in one organ can influence the function of another as I am trying to find the association between diabetic signs and kidney function and Afib embolization.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize that we can reduce the gap in the performance of PRSs between diverse populations by developing methods to generate PRSs for populations of diverse ancestry.  All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program. We will meta-analyze the available genotype data along with similar data from dbGaP and additional datasets to improve performance of PRSs in African American, Latino, and Asian populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Coronary Heart Disease)
Population Health
Methods Development
Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To generate PRSs for diverse ancestries, we will use data from the eMERGE consortium, Million Veteran’s Program (MVP), the All of Us (AoU) program, dbGaP, PRIMED consortium sites, the UK Biobank, and collaborations with several international groups representing Middle Eastern, South Asian, and East Asian cohorts. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Integrate and harmonize data from heterogeneous sources to enable cross platform phenotyping and generation of PRSs for common diseases in diverse ancestry groups. Aim 2. Develop PRSs for CHD and its major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia) in populations of diverse ancestry.  Aim 3. Develop novel statistical and computational methods to account for diverse genetic ancestry and admixture in models of polygenic risk. Aim 4. Develop ‘clinic ready’ PRSs for diverse ancestry groups by creating reference distributions of a CHD PRS and integrate it with clinical information to compute absolute risk estimates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that increasing representation of diverse populations in genotyped datasets will enable the generation of more robust PRSs in these populations. We expect to advance PRS methodology for diverse populations and use novel population genetics approaches. Additionally, we will develop ‘clinic ready’ PRSs for diverse ancestry groups by creating reference distributions of a CHD PRS and integrate it with clinical information to compute absolute risk estimates.","Demographic Categories of Interest
