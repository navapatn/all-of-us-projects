Nearly 2 million people suffer from the autoimmune disease known as Type I Diabetes in the US. Strong genetic components have been found between HLA Class II genes (antigen presenting on T cells) and Type I Diabetes. We are interested in exploring HLA allele frequencies associations for Type I Diabetes in the All of Us cohort, and determining which alleles have higher risk of developing the disease, and whether the known alleles are replicated across different ancestries. We will look at potential other HLA alleles (apart from Class II) that may play a role in the risk for Type I Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 1 diabetes mellitus)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We are interested in accessing the Type I Diabetes to contrast with two control populations: the general population and Type II Diabetes. To generate HLA alleles, we will use imputation methods such as SNP2HLA or DEEP*HLA. Our first attempt will be to replicate previous well-classified HLA associations to determine how well our imputation worked. We will then proceed to determine novel associations using a case-control analysis. We will adjust for population substructure and incorporate local ancestry. We will use the All of Us platform to access de-identified EHR and genomic data in a context that will protect the privacy of participants.","Anticipated Findings
HLA is the most diverse genomic region which makes it difficult to study in traditional association studies. Understanding the variation underpinning Type 1 Diabetes in different ancestry groups will increase our understanding of how the diversity affects the etiology of this autoimmune disorder. Furthermore, given that genetic testing is more prevalent, it will increase care by allowing the identification of high-risk patients before the onset of the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers. In response to FNIH RFP2 “GENERATION of New genetic, -omic, or biomarker data for Common Metabolic Diseases,” we propose to generate and discover novel genetic associations in the All of Us Research Program.","Project Purpose(s)

We will perform disease, disease-related trait, and covariate harmonization in the All of Us Cohort for diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease outcomes and hypertension), disease-related traits (glycemic traits, CVD risk factors, blood pressure), and important covariates (adiposity traits, smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). We will report counts and power calculations that describe the genetic associations that could be discovered in the All of Us Cohort. We will explore the availability of additional common metabolic diseases and complications and perform power calculations for these traits. We will perform genetic association analyses with each disease and outcome (type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and NAFLD).","Anticipated Findings

This workbench aims to validate the study of Abegaz et al. (https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/8/1138) and to uncover fairness in the way in which the model predicts on certain patients. This entails measuring the difference in AUC and statistical parity between different genders and ethnicies.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
The first part of the study will be on constructing a classification model to automatically predict if a person has diabetes. There exist many such models for this like random forrest models, gradient boosted trees, artificial neural networks and simple logistic regression. The notebook will examine ways to mitigate the effects of being underrepresented in the dataset using method like Random Over Sampling and Interpolated Over Sampling (like SMOTE).","Anticipated Findings
The study expects to find classification models to predict most correctly on well represented groups within the All of Us Dataset. If there is a significant disparity of model fairness between genders or ethnicities  then this would call for more validation studies of other papers which do not examine fairness on protected features.
Decision trees, convolutional neural networks, and encoder decoder networks can be used to find latent feature representations of the highly dimensional datasets. These methods are useful in finding important features used in the prediction process, and can be used to see the importance of sensitive variables like race and gender in classification. We can also stratify the dataset by race and gender and see if certain features are important for some groups but not for others.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a highly polygenic disease, has been progressively increasing to epidemic proportions. We are constructing risk prediction tools for T2D and complications that could help guide clinicians implement personalized screening and management approaches to prevent T2D and complications. The integration of polygenic risk scores (PRS) into risk prediction models enhances the performance of these models. Yet the T2D prediction models that consider both clinical risks and T2D PRS fail to account for the underlying heterogeneous pathophysiology of T2D. We hypothesize that classification models, trained on a large data set and validated on a diverse group of patients, that exhaust the genetic risk for the pathologies involved in T2D development along with the clinical and environmental risk factors will provide more accurate predictions and guide individualized interventions to prevent both T2D and its multiple complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
Our hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims: Aim 1. To develop a classification model for predicting T2D based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors. After identifying individuals with T2D as well as all relevant clinical and lifestyle risk factors and calculating the PRS for T2D and relevant risk factors, we will use a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm for classification. We will then select the top features associated with the disease and use them to build a simplified prediction model. Aim 2. To develop classification models for predicting T2D complications based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors. We will identify people with T2D microvascular (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy) and macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease) complications. Multiple PRS for risk factors of each complication, T2D PRS, and the targeted complication PRS will be integrated into the classification model.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study will improve risk prediction by taking account of the genetic risks of the underlying pathologies involved in the development of T2D and complications as well as the clinical and lifestyle risk factors. We except the classification models for T2D and complication to achieve high predictability in diverse populations. We expect to determine the key risk factors for T2D complications and use them to build simplified focused classification models that will help clinicians make person-centered screening and management decisions to prevent complications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes are leading causes of significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is widely known that physical activity may have a protective effect on development of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Per the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, It is currently recommended that pregnant women get at-least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for its benefits. However, there have been no studies that have used strictly recorded real-time data (i.e Fitbit device) on  physical activity to show the exact amount of exercise needed to have benefit to decrease maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.","Project Purpose(s)

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize that we can reduce the gap in the performance of PRSs between diverse populations by developing methods to generate PRSs for populations of diverse ancestry.  All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program.

Diabetes mellitus is a (potentially chronic) disease categorized by excessive concentrations of glucose in the bloodstream and, consequently, the urine—this is colloquially known as “diabetes” (which is what we will be referring to as well). Diabetes mellitus can further be broken into two categories: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Both types have underlying genetic influences, but the main difference is that type 1 is postulated as being caused by the body’s immune system attacking and wreaking havoc on the body's own pancreas, while type 2 has been shown to strongly correlate to physical hypoactivity and obesity. Type 1 used to be called “juvenile diabetes” due to being significantly more common in children and not having been linked to lifestyle factors (e.g., an individual’s own choices).","Project Purpose(s)

We will similarly calculate change in weight. Discontinuation of the index GLP-1 RA within 3 months will be a proxy for drug intolerance. We will perform GWAS for each endpoint. Multiple linear regression using an additive model will test the association between variants and quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and principal components. For medication discontinuation, logistic regression will be used. Analyses will be computed for each ancestry and meta-analyzed.

Diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, fatty liver disease and cancer are the epidemic illnesses of modern life. These diseases often occur together, and one common cause is resistance to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance; IR). When measured in the clinic, IR can strongly predict who will develop these diseases later in life. The causes of IR are both hereditary (genetic) and environmental. There is only one class of drugs, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), that treats IR, but TZDs have serious side effects that prevent their widespread use. If we knew which genes were responsible for changing IR, new and much needed therapies could be developed. Here, we propose to use genetic information from participants in All of Us to find people who are genetically protected from IR and look for the specific genetic variants that confer this protection. The result of this project will be new potential targets for therapeutic development to prevent and treat these epidemic scale chronic diseases.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We propose to use previously published GWAS for traits related to insulin sensitivity/resistance to construct an insulin resistance genetic risk score composed of a series of SNPs. The score for every participant from All of Us will be computed. The participant score will be regressed against the clinical data of the participants including diabetes, cardiovascular events and incident cancers as well as physiologic measures of body composition and relevant serum chemistries and lipid levels. A quantitative clinical profile will be constructed based on this score that is a composite of diagnoses, physiologic and serum measurements. The whole genome sequencing of subgroups of individuals with extreme clinical profile values will be examined for loss-of-function mutations in protein coding genes.","Anticipated Findings

1- What are the main prescribed medication sequences that participants  with  type 2 diabetes and depression took over three years of treatment?
In this questions, we are extracting the anti-diabetes and anti-depressant medications used to to treated participants who have T2D and depression codes. We retrieved medications prescribed after the first diagnosis code for each disease. We represented the medications using their ATC 4th level.
2- What is the most common first anti-diabetic and anti-depressant that were prescribed for All of Us participants? We extracted the first medications prescribed to treat T2D and depression. We identified the most common first medication with the highest number of participants.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a highly polygenic disease, has been progressively increasing to epidemic proportions. We are constructing risk prediction tools for T2D and complications that could help guide clinicians implement personalized screening and management approaches to prevent T2D and complications. The integration of polygenic risk scores (PRS) into risk prediction models enhances the performance of these models. Yet the T2D prediction models that consider both clinical risks and T2D PRS fail to account for the underlying heterogeneous pathophysiology of T2D.
We hypothesize that classification models, trained on a large data set and validated on a diverse group of patients, that exhaust the genetic risk for the pathologies involved in T2D development along with the clinical and environmental risk factors will provide more accurate predictions and guide individualized interventions to prevent both T2D and its multiple complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
Our hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims:
Aim 1. To develop a classification model for predicting T2D based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
After identifying individuals with T2D as well as all relevant clinical and lifestyle risk factors and calculating the PRS for T2D and relevant risk factors, we will use a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm for classification. We will then select the top features associated with the disease and use them to build a simplified prediction model.
Aim 2. To develop classification models for predicting T2D complications based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
We will identify people with T2D microvascular (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy) and macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease) complications. Multiple PRS for risk factors of each complication, T2D PRS, and the targeted complication PRS will be integrated into the classification model.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study will improve risk prediction by taking account of the genetic risks of the underlying pathologies involved in the development of T2D and complications as well as the clinical and lifestyle risk factors. We except the classification models for T2D and complication to achieve high predictability in diverse populations. We expect to determine the key risk factors for T2D complications and use them to build simplified focused classification models that will help clinicians make person-centered screening and management decisions to prevent complications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

One key measure of diabetes diagnosis is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which reflects blood glucose levels over a period of the past two to three months. However, this lab value has been shown to have a statistically higher mean in minority populations. Specifically, genetic markers implicated in individuals of African ancestry artificially change measured HbA1c levels and potentially make it difficult to diagnose diabetes within this population. We are interested in exploring the effects of this diagnostic and prognostic obstacle on the progression and outcomes of diabetes and subsequent complications in individuals of African ancestry compared to those of other ancestries, including European.","Project Purpose(s)

We will employ genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and regression analysis to accomplish our research goals, correcting for both gender, age, and genetic principal components.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that the variability in HbA1c across ancestries and genetic variants will impact the risk of developing diabetic complications in vulnerable populations. While HbA1c is a widely relied upon diagnostic and prognostic factor for diabetes, such findings would highlight the need to employ other additional measures of glucose control in order to accurately monitor disease in certain populations. Furthermore, we may uncover a need to routinely screen individuals of African ancestry for certain genetic variants that affect HbA1c levels to prevent drastic changes down the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize that we can reduce the gap in the performance of PRSs between diverse populations by developing methods to generate PRSs for populations of diverse ancestry.  All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program.

Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Integrate and harmonize data from heterogeneous sources to enable cross platform phenotyping and generation of PRSs for common diseases in diverse ancestry groups. Aim 2. Develop PRSs for CHD and its major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia) in populations of diverse ancestry.  Aim 3.

The overall statistical analysis approach consists of three components as follows. First, we will analyze distributions of relevant clinical data from participants, such as eGFR and age separated by sex. Second, we will analyze population stratification using ADMIXTURE (Shringapure et al, 2016) and PLINK (Purcell et al, 2007) to identify any subpopulations that differ genetically and if disease prevalence differs among those subpopulations (Marchini et al, 2004).

Our aim is to analyze the relationship between gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia in women of different racial backgrounds. Past literature suggests a relationship between gestational diabetes and race, with women of color being disproportionately affected compared to their white counterparts. In addition, it has been suggested that gestational diabetes is a major risk factor for pre-eclampsia. If both of these hold true, we expect to see increased risks for pre-eclampsia with markers associated with gestational diabetes.

In addition, as research suggests there may be a genetic component to the development of complications in individuals with T2D, we aim to utilize some of the genomic data from the controlled tier to further enhance our dataset. This may be through examining individual polymorphisms associated with T2D and its complications as well as GWAS or PRS data combining multiple genotypic variations.

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Such populations include those who were born in, or resided in, countries with high TB prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (homeless shelters or correctional facilities).
Others who should be screened are immunosuppressed (persons living with HIV, on immunosuppressive medications like chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or after an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis.

1- What are the main prescribed medication sequences that participants  with  type 2 diabetes and depression took over three years of treatment?
In this questions, we are extracting the anti-diabetes and anti-depressant medications used to to treated participants who have T2D and depression codes. We retrieved medications prescribed after the first diagnosis code for each disease. We represented the medications using their ATC 4th level.
2- What is the most common first anti-diabetic and anti-depressant that were prescribed for All of Us participants? We extracted the first medications prescribed to treat T2D and depression. We identified the most common first medication with the highest number of participants.
3- Is there a change in the percentages of participants who were prescribed first common medication, treated using one medication, treated only using one common medication between 2000-2018?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes, depression)
Other Purpose (This work is a result of an All of Us Research Program Demonstration Project. The projects are efforts by the Program designed to meet the program's goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating discovery in science and medicine. This work was reviewed and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and the Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including policies for acceptable data access and use.)","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we plan on using the medication sequencing developed at Columbia University and the OHDSI network as a means to characterize treatment pathways at scale. Further, we want to demonstrate implementation of these medication sequencing algorithms in the All of Us research dataset to show how the various sources of data contained within the program can be used to characterize treatment pathways at scale. We will perform separate medication sequence analyses for three different common, complex diseases: type 2 diabetes, depression
1- Data manipulation
Using python and BigQuery to:
A- Retrieve medication and their classes
B-Create the medications sequences
2- Visualization:
A- Creating sunburst to visualize the sequences
B- Plotting the percentages of participants the first common medication and one medication during three years","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity of the data by showing expected treatment patterns despite gathering data from over 30 individual EHR sites. Specifically, we expect to find:
1- Variation in the medication sequences prescribed to treat All of Us participants who had type 2 diabetes and depression.
2- The most common medication used to treat participants as first line treatment with type 2 diabetes and depression diagnosis.
3- A trend or change over time of prescribing the first common medication over the study period
4- Trend overtime for the percentage of participants
Importantly, the detailed code developed herein is made available within the Researcher Workbench to researchers, so that they may more easily extract medication data and class information using a common medication ontology, an approach useful in many discovery studies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am exploring the data to understand diabetes in patients with HIV/AIDS. The scientific question to be answered is whether HIV-infected adults are at higher risk to develop diabetes compared to non-HIV adults. The secondary question is effectiveness of diabetes oral medications among HIV-infected and non-HIV adults if data available. The data regarding diabetes in HIV-infected adults is controversial. With the advancement of HIV treatment, HIV has become a chronic disease. Diabetes management in this population is increasingly important determinants of the complications. It is important to understand the diabetes treatment response among HIV vs non-HIV population.","Project Purpose(s)

In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood glucose measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of diabetes in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood glucose medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one diabetes medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated  blood glucose.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for diabetes from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’.

Nearly 2 million people suffer from the autoimmune disease known as Type I Diabetes in the US. Strong genetic components have been found between HLA Class II genes (antigen presenting on T cells) and Type I Diabetes. We are interested in exploring HLA allele frequencies associations for Type I Diabetes in the All of Us cohort, and determining which alleles have higher risk of developing the disease, and whether the known alleles are replicated across different ancestries. We will look at potential other HLA alleles (apart from Class II) that may play a role in the risk for Type I Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 1 diabetes mellitus)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We are interested in accessing the Type I Diabetes to contrast with two control populations: the general population and Type II Diabetes. To generate HLA alleles, we will use imputation methods such as SNP2HLA or DEEP*HLA. Our first attempt will be to replicate previous well-classified HLA associations to determine how well our imputation worked. We will then proceed to determine novel associations using a case-control analysis. We will adjust for population substructure and incorporate local ancestry. We will use the All of Us platform to access de-identified EHR and genomic data in a context that will protect the privacy of participants.","Anticipated Findings
HLA is the most diverse genomic region which makes it difficult to study in traditional association studies. Understanding the variation underpinning Type 1 Diabetes in different ancestry groups will increase our understanding of how the diversity affects the etiology of this autoimmune disorder. Furthermore, given that genetic testing is more prevalent, it will increase care by allowing the identification of high-risk patients before the onset of the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)

We will analyze data from the All of Us Research Program database regarding alcohol consumption behaviors, ALDH2 genotype (rs671), demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. All participants with informative data for rs671 will be included in the study. These data sets will be from surveys, physical measurements, and the genomic data set. Statistical analyses will be done using R or python. We will examine relationships between these factors and alcohol consumption using Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables), overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors, for example, demographics.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This is an exploratory workspace, the first I have attempted, to help me get familiar with All of Us Research methods.  At the same time, it will investigate a real research question:
""Is treatment of type 2 diabetes with Metformin (as opposed to no treatment)  associated with the incidence of infectious diseases such as COVID, flu, Lyme disease, or Zoster?""
My hypothesis is that Metformin is protective, and this effect may or may not be mediated by lowering HbA1c levels.
This question is important, because over 37 million Americans (not to mention other people around the world) have type 2 diabetes, and there is evidence that this puts them at risk for greater incidence of and/or more severe infectious disease. Does Metformin lower their risk?","Project Purpose(s)

I will use a Cox Proportional Hazards model to test for difference between participants on Metformin and those not. Lab values for HbA1c levels (mean of all tests during period?) will also be tested for a mediation effect if the primary hypothesis proves true.

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration).

The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers.

Why does the large food consumption cause more adolescent African-American males to have type two diabetes than Caucasian males as grown adults?
This question is important because in some of our families, people are obese, and trying to lose weight sometimes is problematic. We are wondering if obesity can be genetically inherited or is just acquired by bad eating habits. To determine this, we plan to look through the database and determine whether our question is correct.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
The hypothesis is testable since we can take an obese African American individual with type 2 diabetes and compare them to an obese person without type 2 diabetes. We can see if the individual carries the gene and if it is genetically inherited by looking at their parent’s 20th chromosome on their karyotype as well as their own. Research shows that African Americans are more susceptible to having type 2 diabetes while being obese compared to Caucasians. This hypothesis can be fallible because type 2 diabetes isn’t 100% genetically inherited, but genetics play a significant role in its development. It may just be developed due to obesity and has nothing to do with being genetically inherited.","Anticipated Findings
If an African-American male (ages 8-16) without type 2 diabetes is obese, they are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than a Caucasian male (ages 8-16) who is obese without type 2 diabetes.
If an African American male (ages 8-16) without type 2 diabetes is obese, they have a lower probability of developing type 2 diabetes than a Caucasian male who is obese without type 2 diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Most of our traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. This research focuses on the genetic contributions and in particular on those to different disease risks. What regions of our DNA affect which traits and how much? Can we use DNA to identify individuals at high risk for a certain disease and take preventive measures early or perhaps even before an onset of the disease? For many diseases, such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease, the answer to this question is already yes. By looking at up to tens of thousands DNA locations, specific to each disease, it is possible to estimate the genetic disease risk. These predictions are not exact but are good enough to already be used clinically saving lives and limiting the severity of diseases. The main purpose of this project is to develop and validate methods to make such risk predictions from DNA and to make this technology equally available to all of us, regardless of our genetic backgrounds.","Project Purpose(s)

Commercial","Scientific Approaches
This research project is using various machine learning algorithms (computer programs), such as L1-penalized regression, elastic nets, Bayesian regressions, random forests, and neural networks. All of them require large datasets with genetic information paired with different phenotypes, e.g. disease status, blood pressure, past surgeries, etc. The phenotypes are either used as ""the answer"", what you try to teach the algorithm to predict, or other factors that you are trying to compensate for (e.g. if you are trying to predict blood pressure, you may want to correct for use of blood thinning medications). The data needs to be quality controlled and prepared for effective analysis which involves a multitude of statistical tools, including principal component analyses, data transformations and subsampling. Where available, we will also use sibling analyses. Siblings typically share childhood environments making the such data particularly useful for studies of the genetic effects.","Anticipated Findings
The validation aspect of the project will tell us how well already existing predictors (trained on other datasets) are performing. This evaluation on a completely independent dataset is the best way to get an honest measure of how well the predictor works (metrics we use are primarily AUC, variation explained, correlation, and odds ratios). The extraordinary advantage All of Us has is its diversity which will provide answers about the predictor performance not only on the subpopulations used for training but on populations from very different ancestries, environments and lifestyles. This is an invaluable tool to characterize and minimize performance differences that historically have arisen due to skewed data availability.
The validation results will guide the development phase which will yield new methods, predictors and tools to combine different types of information for the most accurate disease risk and health predictions possible, for each one of us.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My partner and I intend to answer the question: do physical factors such as BMI, mean waist circumference, and mean hip circumference constitute a higher risk factor for coronary heart disease? We also aim to find if there is a correlation between type II diabetes and coronary heart disease and if genetic risk factors for diabetes also increase the prevalence of coronary heart disease. Finally, we wish to find if there is a particular age range, gender, and ethnicity that is at a higher risk for coronary heart disease. We aim to explore this dataset to help determine if certain groups may be at a higher risk for coronary heart disease according to their genomic makeup.  If we can determine how select groups are more prone to coronary heart disease from an examination of their genome, mortality rates could be lowered through an emphasis on lifestyle changes and disease prevention.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
My partner and I plan to compare mean waist circumference, mean hip circumference, and BMI to the prevalence of coronary heart disease in comparison to these factors. We also plan to look for genetic risk factors linked to type II diabetes and the diagnosis of participants with coronary artery disease. Through this, we hope to see if genetic links to type II diabetes can also be linked to coronary heart disease. Next, we plan to take a randomized group of individuals or a wide range of ages, genders, and ethnicities and compare the prevalence of coronary artery disease among the different ages, genders, and ethnicities and see if we can determine if there is a specific group that may be at a higher risk.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate finding those who are older, male, and white to have a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease. We also anticipate finding a correlation between genetic mutations in genes linked to Type II diabetes and coronary artery disease. Finally, we expect to see a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease in those with increased BMI, increased mean waist circumference, and increased mean hip circumference.  Our findings can hopefully encourage groups we find to be high risk to get regular screenings, as well as potentially work to create a change in the mean waist and hip circumference. Additionally, we hope to determine genetic mutations that are linked to coronary artery disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Most of our traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. This research focuses on the genetic contributions and in particular on those to different disease risks. What regions of our DNA affect which traits and how much? Can we use DNA to identify individuals at high risk for a certain disease and take preventive measures early or perhaps even before an onset of the disease? For many diseases, such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease, the answer to this question is already yes. By looking at up to tens of thousands DNA locations, specific to each disease, it is possible to estimate the genetic disease risk. These predictions are not exact but are good enough to already be used clinically saving lives and limiting the severity of diseases. The main purpose of this project is to develop and validate methods to make such risk predictions from DNA and to make this technology equally available to all of us, regardless of our genetic backgrounds.","Project Purpose(s)

This research project is using various machine learning algorithms (computer programs), such as L1-penalized regression, elastic nets, Bayesian regressions, random forests, and neural networks. All of them require large datasets with genetic information paired with different phenotypes, e.g. disease status, blood pressure, past surgeries, etc. The phenotypes are either used as ""the answer"", what you try to teach the algorithm to predict, or other factors that you are trying to compensate for (e.g. if you are trying to predict blood pressure, you may want to correct for use of blood thinning medications). The data needs to be quality controlled and prepared for effective analysis which involves a multitude of statistical tools, including principal component analyses, data transformations and subsampling. Where available, we will also use sibling analyses. Siblings typically share childhood environments making the such data particularly useful for studies of the genetic effects.","Anticipated Findings
The validation aspect of the project will tell us how well already existing predictors (trained on other datasets) are performing. This evaluation on a completely independent dataset is the best way to get an honest measure of how well the predictor works (metrics we use are primarily AUC, variation explained, correlation, and odds ratios). The extraordinary advantage All of Us has is its diversity which will provide answers about the predictor performance not only on the subpopulations used for training but on populations from very different ancestries, environments and lifestyles. This is an invaluable tool to characterize and minimize performance differences that historically have arisen due to skewed data availability.
The validation results will guide the development phase which will yield new methods, predictors and tools to combine different types of information for the most accurate disease risk and health predictions possible, for each one of us.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Tuberculosis (TB) has been decade after decade the greatest infectious disease killer globally. 1.6 million died in 2021.
Diagnosis, lack of access to healthcare, difficulty adhering to and completing regimens, and other comorbidities (HIV, diabetes, cancer, immunosuppression such as for autoimmune disorders) worsen TB outcomes. TB in the US is often in those who are foreign born, those who are older, associated with lack of housing or incarceration, and those with other comorbidities.

Using the ALL of US full cohort, we can help determine the associations of some of these factors which would have been modifiable. Such modifiable risk factors would include: HIV without any or consistent HIV (ART) treatment, use of prednisone or common immunosuppressive drugs before the onset of TB (note TB treatment can include prednisone which should not be considered a risk), poorly controlled diabetes (stratified by hemoglobin a1c or in those insulin dependent without Hga1c recorded), known latent TB (quantiferon, T-spot, or Mantoux positivity) without latent TB treatment. We will also assess the timeframe of who has been assessed for latent TB before or with TB diagnosis and how many are not treated for latent TB, especially in those with another risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify any gaps in latent TB screening and treatment, while also highlighting any gaps in HIV and diabetes care, as well as care for those who are immunocompromised.

Previous genetic studies have successfully identified >240 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many of the identified loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome, masking the underlying “effector gene”. Additionally, these studies were primarily performed in individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. As genetic findings are integrated into the clinic, this limited genetic understanding threatens to exacerbate existing health disparities among non-European communities disproportionately suffering from T2D and T2D-related health complications. Expanding our genetic understanding into non-European ancestries is essential as these studies will mitigate such health disparities and improve our ability to identify causal loci and mechanisms. In this study, I will leverage the diversity found within All of Us to perform a trans-ancestry genetic analysis of T2D, identifying likely causal variants and evaluating their potential for clinical utility.","Project Purpose(s)

Using well-established techniques in statistical genetics, I will (1) conduct a genome wide association study of common variants, as well as other forms of genetic variation (e.g., rare variants, copy number variations), to identify trans-ancestry and ancestry-specific disease-associated loci, (2) use statistical and functional fine-mapping techniques to identify the likely causal variants at disease-associated loci, validating my findings with experimental approaches, and (3) evaluate the clinical utility of my findings through polygenic scores (PGSs) and screening for potential targets of drug repurposing. For these analyses, I will use all participants with genetic data (whole genome and SNP-array). I will develop a phenotypic algorithm to classify participants into T2D cases and controls based on previously published work in electronic health records.","Anticipated Findings
Genetic studies of T2D have already provided valuable insight into disease pathophysiology. However, the vast majority of these studies have been performed in European and East Asian ancestries, threatening to exacerbate existing health disparities in populations carrying a disproportionate disease burden as genetics enters the clinic through preventative and therapeutic interventions. In the present study, I aim to address these shortcomings by leveraging the diversity found within All of Us to expand our genetic understanding of T2D. Based on the prior success of similar studies, I expect to identify many rare and common T2D-associated loci that are shared across ancestries as well as ancestry-specific. Combined with experimental and computational approaches, I will use these results to identify variants that are likely causal for T2D, propose the mechanism by which these variants contribute to T2D risk, and propose ways to translate my findings into clinical intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Metabolic diseases are a global epidemic. They occur when cells allocate too many of their primary resources towards one pathway, such as lipid production, at the expense of other crucial pathways, such as energy production. Understanding how cells control the pivotal point of allocating glucose towards lipid or energy production is key to developing effective treatments for these and other common metabolic diseases. PAS kinase (PASK) is a nutrient sensing protein kinase that regulates this critical metabolic node of lipid versus respiratory metabolism. PASK controls many of the hallmark pathways associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative disease yet little is known about PASK alleles associated with human disease. Herein we propose to conduct the first large-scale analysis to identify PASK alleles associated with human disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We target PASK as well as two of its substrates for our study.  Due to their regulation of the critical node of glucose partitioning to lipid versus respiratory metabolism, we propose to uncover the influence of PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on a variety of human phenotypes and classes of disease, from hyperlipidemia and diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders using the All of Us dataset.
In addition to the wide variety of phenotypic data that will aid in understanding the influence of variation in cellular respiration and triglyceride levels, the ancestral diversity represented by the individuals in the dataset will allow us to identify patterns and variants that differ or are similar across ancestry, defining effects common to humankind while opening further studies on multigene, secondary variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

New Glucose-Lowering Drugs and Cognitive Impairment in Adults with Diabetes,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a growing sequela of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Cognitive impairment (CI) is a growing sequela of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Three newer glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) are used as second-line therapy for T2D, i.e., glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4). Some data suggest that these GLDs may have cognitive benefits, however, comparisons across drug classes are scarce. We intended to investigate the associations between newer GLD and CI among adults with T2D.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Adults with diagnosed or self-reported T2D will be identified from the dataset. We used medication codes to identify the person’s GLD use. We will study three groups: (1) adults filling Metformin plus DPP4, (2) adults filling Metformin plus SGLT2i, and (3) adults filling Metformin plus GLP-1RA. CI was measured using ICD code or survey from EHR. The three groups were matched with a 1:1 multigroup propensity score algorithm based on age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities (e.g., obesity, and cardiovascular disease). Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to compare the associations between newer GLD use and CI, further adjusting for residual unbalanced covariates after matching.","Anticipated Findings
There are three categories of glucose-lowering drugs, which include GLP1-RA, DPP4, and SGLT2i. The study may show that one of these categories is associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment compared to the other two categories. For patients with type 2 diabetes who have experienced a decline in cognitive function, clinicians may consider prescribing drugs from this particular category to help slow down the rate of cognitive decline.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I will be investigating the utility of genetic risk score derivation to classify diabetes type among subjects in the ""The Immune Response in human Type 1 Diabetes Etiology"" cross-sectional study being performed at the Stanford Diabetes Research Center. The genetic risk score estimates we are using were developed primarily based on a population of subjects of European ancestry and it is uncertain whether these risk estimates translate to people of non-European ancestry, which is one of the questions we will attempt to answer.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I will stratify diabetes type genetic risk score (GRS) by ancestry to determine if the distribution of GRS has significant variation by ancestry group. For populations where GRS is significantly different from those with European ancestry, I will estimate population specific risk scales and test if these risk estimates are similar in our pediatric study cohort when stratified by ancestry. For statistical methods, I will derive genetic ancestry using pre-trained machine learning based classification models based on principal components analysis and will analyze the correlation (R2) between genetic and self-reported ancestry. I will use parametric t-testing to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean between each ancestry group with European ancestry individuals. Bonferroni correction will be applied to adjust alpha threshold for multiple testing. Percentiles of GRS derived from All of Us will be translated to absolute risk calculations as a product of prevalence.","Anticipated Findings
Our findings would be particularly notable if the genetic risk score estimates are not valid in subjects of non-European ancestry as it would imply that polygenic risk scores do not simply translate across different genetic ancestry thus requiring modification or otherwise development of new risk estimates specific to subjects non-European ancestry. Alternatively, it would also be significant to find that the genetic risk estimates are able to be validated in populations of non-European ancestry as it would potentially remove a barrier to bring polygenic risk scores to the patient bedside to aid in diagnosis or identify high risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Nearly 2 million people suffer from the autoimmune disease known as Type I Diabetes in the US. Strong genetic components have been found between HLA Class II genes (antigen presenting on T cells) and Type I Diabetes. We are interested in exploring HLA allele frequencies associations for Type I Diabetes in the All of Us cohort, and determining which alleles have higher risk of developing the disease, and whether the known alleles are replicated across different ancestries. We will look at potential other HLA alleles (apart from Class II) that may play a role in the risk for Type I Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 1 diabetes mellitus)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We are interested in accessing the Type I Diabetes to contrast with two control populations: the general population and Type II Diabetes. To generate HLA alleles, we will use imputation methods such as SNP2HLA or DEEP*HLA. Our first attempt will be to replicate previous well-classified HLA associations to determine how well our imputation worked. We will then proceed to determine novel associations using a case-control analysis. We will adjust for population substructure and incorporate local ancestry. We will use the All of Us platform to access de-identified EHR and genomic data in a context that will protect the privacy of participants.","Anticipated Findings
HLA is the most diverse genomic region which makes it difficult to study in traditional association studies. Understanding the variation underpinning Type 1 Diabetes in different ancestry groups will increase our understanding of how the diversity affects the etiology of this autoimmune disorder. Furthermore, given that genetic testing is more prevalent, it will increase care by allowing the identification of high-risk patients before the onset of the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

EHR diagnosis codes use for billing are known to be rife with inaccuracies. For example, a patient may be evaluated for diabetes mellitus but then have a diabetes mellitus code assigned to their chart. As a result, using the structured diagnosis codes in an analysis may give inaccurate conclusions. For large genetic studies, one way to improve the code accuracy is to only consider patients as having the disease as those with at least two diagnosis codes on different days. There are other simple heuristics that could be applied to improve accuracy across various disease by incorporating temporal patterns of various features. This project aims to study these temporal patterns to see if there is a rule that can be used to improve the accuracy of identifying patients with specific diseases.","Project Purpose(s)

My plan is to use the survey data and EHR data to create more refined definitions for phecodes. Phecodes are a group of labels used to define a specific disease.

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease. Thus, the purpose of this workspace is  to develop internal methods for examining the association between polygenic risk scores of unique intermediate phenotypes derived in diverse  population based cohorts, and overt cardiometabolic disease within All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)

The current workbench serves as a first step toward identifying novel pathways linking intermediate phenotypes available in our diverse population based cohorts to cardiometabolic disease risk in All of Us.

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Lifespan diabetes and diabetes complications)","Scientific Approaches
To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations.  Findings are expected to advance precision care of patients with diabetes and related conditions in people of diverse ancestral background and serve as a paradigm for many other complex diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle).

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)

We will analyze data from the All of Us Research Program database regarding alcohol consumption behaviors, ALDH2 genotype (rs671), demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. All participants with informative data for rs671 will be included in the study. These data sets will be from surveys, physical measurements, and the genomic data set. Statistical analyses will be done using R or python. We will examine relationships between these factors and alcohol consumption using Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables), overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors, for example, demographics.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A majority of MODY cases are caused by pathogenic variants in three genes: HNF1A, HNF4A and GCK. The prevalence and penetrance of pathogenic variants in MODY-associated genes is still relatively unclear. Proper identification and diagnosis of MODY is important as the condition has treatment implications differ from other forms of diabetes . For example, first line treatment for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY subtypes is sulfonylureas vs. insulin in type 1 or metformin in type 2. For GCK-MODY, pharmacologic treatment is unnecessary except in some cases. The goals of this project are two-fold. We are interested in better understanding the prevalence and penetrance of these variants in the AoU cohort. We are interested in understanding how well treatments prescribed match clinical guidelines indicated by genetic etiology for  those with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic MODY variant.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) )
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will identify individuals in the cohort with a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in one of the MODY-associated genes using classifications from the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel for Variation Curation, which is a group of physicians, geneticists, and laboratory pathologists that work on MODY.   From the eligible individuals, we will look at diagnosis of diabetes, age of diagnosis, family history of diabetes, and treatment information. We will be using methods for penetrance estimate based on previous work by Mirshahi et al. 2022 (PMID 36257325). Because of phenotypic and onset differences between HNF1A/HNF4A MODY and GCK MODY, we will use two separate methodologies to estimate penetrance. To estimate the penetrance of diabetes for those with a HNF1A or HNF4A variant, we will use Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. For those with a GCK variant, we will use Fisher’s exact test to estimate the penetrance for mild hyperglycemia.","Anticipated Findings
By gaining an estimate for the prevalence and penetrance of known MODY-associated variants, we will have a better understanding of how common these variants are in the population and how likely a variant will result in disease.   Although there has been previous work done in this area, it has been completed predominately in White-European cohorts  and, to our knowledge, not in a healthy US cohort. Through this project, we will be able to gain insights regarding MODY variants in diverse groups living in the United States. By analyzing treatments being used for MODY, we will be able to understand the current clinical landscape for MODY and identify potential areas of improvement. We hope that this work will lead to a better understanding of the presence of MODY-associated variants in the US and better improve health outcomes for individuals with this condition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 1%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD) and related health conditions (e.g., depression and pain).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Second, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The fresh start effect refers to the notion that individuals are more likely to initiate positive changes in their lives following significant events such as birthdays, new years, or other personal milestones. Prior research has demonstrated the fresh start effect on various health outcomes, including glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, the extent to which the fresh start effect influences hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values in patients with diabetes around their birthdays is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients with diabetes experience improvements in glycemic control around their birthdays.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
This will be a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records (EMR) of patients with diabetes. The study will include patients aged 18 years and older who have been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and have at least two HbA1c measurements recorded in the EMR within six months before and six months after their birthday. Patients who have missing data or incomplete medical records will be excluded from the study. HbA1c values will be extracted from the EMR and compared between the six-month period before and after the patient's birthday. Paired t-tests will be used to compare HbA1c values between the two periods. Multiple regression analysis will be used to adjust for potential confounding variables, such as age, sex, race, and comorbidities.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to find that patients with diabetes will have lower HbA1c values in the six-month period after their birthday compared to the six-month period before their birthday, indicating a fresh start effect on glycemic control. The study will contribute to our understanding of how personal milestones such as birthdays may influence health outcomes in patients with diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Relationships will be investigated using the All of Us workbench and R. We will identify our target population with inclusion criteria of Diagnosis of Diabetes between 3/1-2019 and 3/1/2020. Target population will also be stratified by depression status using PhQ-9 scores (0-4: little to no depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, and 20-27 severe depression). We will analyze responses to the COPE survey to summarize reported coping behaviors among different groups of target population and estimate association of coping behaviors with changes in diabetes and depression outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We are expecting to find that newly diagnosed diabetics with depression who engage in healthy coping behaviors, such as yoga and mindfulness, have improved A1c and depression outcomes than those who do not. A second hypothesis is that those who engage in unhealthy coping behaviors will have worse A1c and Depression. This will help researchers and clinicians develop more effective, at-home modules for patients with diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The specific questions that we intend to study with this project, is the different gene-environment interactions that occur in relation to the causation of the diagnosis of Type II Diabetes.

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The scientific approaches that we plan to use for this study, is breaking our inquiry down into 3 specific parts. The first would be recording how genes encoded for this disease are inherited, and their mode of transmission. For that we need to look at pedigrees or flowcharts showing a typical scenario of how an individual could inherit this condition, and compare those probabilities to other unusual scenarios. For example, an offspring may be the carrier for the gene that encodes for diabetes, but may never experience it, due to their lifestyle choices. The other two parts of this research will focus on analyzing complex genes that encode for this condition and how environmental factors affect the mutation rate of these genes and the expression of them over different populations in different environments, regardless of income, or race, but more focusing on type of environment (urban/rural), access to resources, and age.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings in this study would be to unravel the difficulty behind the diagnosis of this disease. Though diabetes is directly related insulin resistance, it wears many hats that we do not know of. It can be a comorbidity to an autoimmune illness, developed by an unhealthy lifestyle, or diagnosed in the neonatal development of the offspring. By drawing connections and analyzing these findings, we can deduce why diabetes can be an apparent risk to anyone regardless of their health circumstances good or bad. Our scientific knowledge can contribute to the field of genetics research and disease, in the fact that it can help produce a possible solution in how we pinpoint its growth.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Unmodeled heterogeneity of the biological underpinnings of phenotypes reduces statistical power and reproducibility in downstream analyses such as genome-wide association studies. While some complex diseases have well-established clinically-relevant subtypes that respond differently to different treatments (e.g., diabetes and asthma), heterogeneity is suspected but has not so far been demonstrated for many other phenotypes. Existing data-driven subtyping methods primarily rely on data clustering methods that are not guaranteed to capture genetically- or clinically-relevant stratification of patients, thus, impeding our ability to take an important step towards personalized medicine by defining treatment at the subphenotypic level. The goal of this proposal is to enable a robust identification of clinically-relevant subphenotypic variation given no prior knowledge.","Project Purpose(s)

This study’s aim is the development of a contrastive learning method to define de novo phenotypic subtypes of complex disease based on electronic health records, and the application of the method to analyze the heterogeneity in clinical trajectories of conditions for which subphenotypic heterogeneity will be identified.","Anticipated Findings
