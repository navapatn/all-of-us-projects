Study the effect of comorbidities while controlling for other clinically reported factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease and dementia that leads to disproportionate morbidity between ethnicities. We would like to explore what health elements are responsible for this diagnosis that causes a difference in its occurrence between ethnicities. We would also like to consider some of the underlying genetic interactions which influence Alzheimer's and dementia development that would establish a clearer cause of the observed ethnic differences due to genetic factors that are non-specific to ethnicity. Understanding the impact of comorbidities and other clinical factors may be used in a preventative medicine and public health context to better understand the progression of disease among subpopulations due to other underlying medical conditions that are easier to address and thus may improve preventative treatment that focuses on resolving the health disparity between ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
This research is part of an undergraduate thesis project and thus scientific approaches will be adjusted over time and will be reflected here. The datasets and tools used will all come from the secure AoU workspace.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings include the ethnic disparity in Alzheimer’s and dementia morbidity that can be explained by a disproportionate occurrence of comorbidities and potential differences in the APOE allele between subpopulations. The demographics of the current cohort of those affected by Alzheimer’s disease and dementia will be better understood for causes that lead to a disproportionate health effect.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Underdiagnosis of Dementias,The national prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to be 11% in individuals over 65 years old and 1.5-2.0 times higher in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups including Black and Hispanic/Latinx.

The national prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to be 11% in individuals over 65 years old and 1.5-2.0 times higher in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups including Black and Hispanic/Latinx. In real world medical care based on prior studies and our work, less than half of patients with dementia have been formally diagnosed and significantly more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Our scientific questions are:
1. Are dementias underdiagnosed in the electronic health record (EHR) compared to population estimates?
2. What are the risk factors for patients to not be formally diagnosed with dementias?
3. How do the underdiagnosis and risk factors differ across racial and ethnic groups?
We hypothesize dementias are underdiagnosed the EHR, more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and that risk factors include demographics, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare access.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will define dementia as probable based on ICD codes and possible based on a combination of ICD codes, medication use and personal medical history. We will calculate the prevalence of dementias across racial and ethnic group compared to population estimates. We will compare risk factors of patients who have probable dementia versus possible dementia using logistic regression correcting for demographics. Risk factors tested will include drug exposures, lab measurement, demographics, health access, and other survey questions. We will compare risk factors across racial and ethnic groups.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that dementias are underdiagnosed the EHR, more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and that risk factors for underdiagnosis include demographics, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare access, which will differ across racial and ethnic groups. These findings may lead to racially and ethnically specific strategies to improve the early and appropriate diagnosis of dementias, which can initiate multi-disciplinary care and treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We have not formalized a specific approach or development. Our methods are first to explore the data and look for indications that support a specific hypothesis.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find distinct differences between Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital and dementia patients admitted to hospital with an acute Covid-19 diagnosis. In many cases, dementia patients have preexisting damage to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) due to a chronic state of inflammation, allowing the viral particles direct access to the brain (Wang et al., 2021). SARS-Cov2 has been shown to induce the release of cytokines IL1, IL-16, TNF-α, exacerbating inflammation and causing further injury to the BBB (Fotuhi et al., 2020). Entry of viral particles and blood material into the CSF can result in thrombotic events, seizures, and encephalitis, all of which can lead to fatal outcomes (Wang et al., 2021). This leaves patients with dementia extremely vulnerable to the development of inflammatory cytokine storms and hypercoagulation cascades common in COVID-19.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Itch is a common clinical phenomenon which worsens with age, and up to one-third of elderly patients report clinically significant itch with moderate impact on their quality of life. Itch and neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease are also significantly associated in aging humans. For example, bullous pemphigoid – a pruritic autoimmune skin disorder whose incidence rises with age – increases the odds of dementia by 10-fold (95% confidence interval 5.4-17.8]). The association between age-related non-neoplastic skin conditions and neurological disorders can be due to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, exposure) or upstream pathophysiology (systemic inflammation, inflammaging), but studies dissecting these potential mechanistic relationships are lacking. In this study, I intend to evaluate the association between dementia and pruritus in an aging population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)","Scientific Approaches
I will use descriptive statistics to characterize pruritic skin diseases in patients with and without dementia including demographic information, inflammatory skin diseases, dementia subtypes, other comorbid medical conditions, and use of specific medications that have been associated with the development of dementia in prior literature (e.g. sedating anti-histamines). I will use basic statistical techniques to assess these relationships including chi-squared analyses, t-tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear multivariable linear regression models.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that these analyses will demonstrate an association between dementia and pruritus, measured by presence/absence of pruritic inflammatory skin diseases. These data will be used to inform future studies on these associations as well as alternative therapeutic options for patients with dementia and itch.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This proposal seeks support for developing advanced clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug-repositioning for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The proposed project directly addresses the areas of emphasis in PAR-20-156 to “develop computational methods such as artificial intelligence/machine learning to investigate new uses of FDA-approved drugs or candidate drugs from failed Phase II/Phase III clinical trials through analysis of multimodal data.” The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug repositioning of AD/ADRD. Our project holds the promise of identifying novel drug repositioning signals.

The proposed framework is novel because it integrates advanced statistical inference procedures with semantic technology for data-driven and reproducible drug repositioning for AD/ADRD. We have three aims: We have three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop signal detection methods using multi-modal data (pharmacy-linked genetic data, genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data, and BioBank data). Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate drugs via historical trials and EHR data. Aim 3: Develop novel semantic and natural language processing (NLP) methods for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction.","Anticipated Findings
The success of this project will lead to novel computational methods, KG, and software for facilitating drug repositioning for AD/ADRD based on multimodal data. If successful, the proposed method could identify novel drug repositioning signals and generate novel hypotheses for prevention and treatment intervention of treat AD/ADRD. Our project holds the promise of identifying novel drug repositioning signals. This project is novel for integrating evidence synthesis methods with signal detection methods using advanced multimodal modeling, and it is potentially transformative for advancing prevention and treatment for AD/ADRD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

To capture the temporal progression of this neurodegenerative disease, the cohort age will be 30 years old and above. All races and ethnicities will be included, as well as all gender identities. Disability status, education level, access to healthcare, sexual orientation, rural vs urban living, and income level will also be included. Correlation statistics will be used.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate seeing economically disadvantaged demographics will show a higher rate of dementia diagnosis. This would elucidate potential avenues of investigation for treating or preventing the onset of the disease, be it through improved nutrition, improved access to healthcare screenings, etc.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Neurological diseases such as Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias can have direct or indirect impacts on day-to-day psychosocial and health behaviors (e.g., activities of daily living, healthcare utilization, self care). Little is known about the impact of neurological diseases in the sexual and gender minority populations. and as sexual and gender minority populations may experience differences in social support and other impacts of structural inequities we would like to know the following:
1) Does the impact of having Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (PD/ADRD) on psychosocial behavioral health, or well-being differ between sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and cisgender, heterosexual (CGH) individuals?
1a) Are there any differences between sexuality and gender identity subpopulations?
2) Comparing SGM and CGH individuals with PD/ADRD are there differences in comorbid conditions?","Project Purpose(s)

We will first identify all of those individuals with valid Sexual Orientation and Gender identity concept answers in the controlled tier dataset, and then among those we will identify the sub population with PD/ADRD diagnoses, and then among that cohort of individuals we will evaluate differences among cohort members based on sex-assigned-at-birth, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
We will use univariate (measures of central tendency, frequencies/distributions) and bivariate statistics (significant differences between groups). Differences will be assessed using the appropriate within and between groups comparisons approaches based on the type of measures used e.g [M]AN[C]OVA ([multiple] analysis of [co-]variance).
If the population of affected individuals is large enough we may evaluate complex relationships among the various psychosocial health and well-being factors using partial correlations, logistic regressions, or other multivariable analyses if appropriate.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate being able to provide some specific descriptive work related to the All-of-us sample, and any group differences that exist. At this point in time the a priori hypothesis is that SGM individuals will have a poorer psychosocial health and well-being than their CGH comparators. When we finish this work we hope that this will generate information that will spark further inquiry and opportunities to conduct studies to better understand and address any disparities that are identified among SGM individuals with PD/ADRD.
Further, descriptive analyses that examine data in the aggregate as well disaggregated data (by groups) and using analyses that allow us to account for intersecting marginalized identities are important for understanding which groups are at greatest risk for poor outcomes. We we anticipate that differences to exist in both the combined and disaggregated analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The initial part of this research will be data exploration in the hope of being able to create an analysis pipeline that can answer the question ""what are the genetic, behavioral and socio-demographic that can determine the risk of developing Dementia and memory loss? How do they interact with each other?"".
The answers to these questions can be relevant for public health, since they could help develop prevention strategies and understand the real impact of external exposures on the development of these common impairing conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I will explore several datasets: genomic data, survey questions (selecting subjects reporting dementia and memory loss), lifestyle, physical activity and demographic. Exploratory analyses will be carried out to characterize the subjects, followed by a clustering/stratification analysis to see whether there are identifiable subgroups of patients. After that, multilevel and hierarchical analysis methods such as Mediation Analysis, Bayesian Networks and Mixed-effects Models will be used to inspect the contribution of different genetic and external factors to the development of the aforementioned conditions. If possible, I might integrate some external datasets about other environmental data.","Anticipated Findings
Possible findings could be that some environmental, social or behavioral factors could impact the development or exacerbation of the conditions more than others, and therefore they should be the starting point for prevention strategies. It could be also possible to find that interactions between factors change depending on the genetic predisposition of the patients, therefore allowing to develop precision medicine techniques.","Demographic Categories of Interest
