My research interest lies in delving into the intricate relationship between environmental metal exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) among the elderly population. I am driven by specific scientific questions that aim to uncover the potential links between exposure to environmental metals and the initiation or progression of these neurodegenerative disorders. One of the central aspects of my research involves assessing the contribution of environmental metal exposure to the risk of developing AD and ADRD in the elderly. Metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum, arsenic, copper, magnesium commonly found in the environment, have the potential to accumulate in the body over time. Understanding this association is vital for identifying preventive measures and interventions to safeguard cognitive health in aging populations.","Project Purpose(s)

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program. Chronic disease is a rising contributor to mortality and morbidity, and many chronic disease risk factors are modifiable. Learning how we can more effectively prevent and control chronic disease among diverse patient populations will be essential for population health improvement. We specifically plan to study the intersection between different chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and other conditions that interact with one another and cause progressive disability.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use a combination of descriptive tools (e.g. estimating prevalence, incidence of various conditions) and modeling tools to model the accumulation of disease risk factors and mortality. Our work will be performed primarily using All of Us data with additional work performed in other population-based data sources including EHR data, UK Biobank, and other large studies.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our study will document the prevalence and risk of developing various types of multimorbidity and chronic disease burden over time and will identify novel risk factors for multimorbidity which could be targeted both to improve population health and to improve health equity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Delirium, a severe medical condition prevalent among older patients, is often linked to various risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), potentially due to shared mechanisms increasing dementia susceptibility. Intriguingly, research suggests that metformin, a medication for DM, not only extends lifespan but also reduces delirium risk in DM patients. Additionally, exploring metformin's effects on genome-wide DNA methylation have shed light on its mechanisms, including pathways related to longevity, AMPK, inflammation, and HIF-1 alpha. However, a deeper understanding of metformin's role in longevity and its impact on delirium risk is warranted. To address this gap, our study aims to investigate metformin's potential influence on delirium risk as well as mortality risk, and also investigate genetic profiles modulating such potential association by examining genome-wide genetic status in patients with and without a history of delirium.","Project Purpose(s)

Dataset: All of Us Controlled Data v07
Tools: R
Research methods:
- Investigate the prevalence of delirium among individuals with and without a history of metformin use, stratified by the status for diabetes mellitus.
- Compare the frequency of SNP alleles related to delirium as a trait among the population first. Then we evaluate the difference of such potential association between participants who have used metformin and those who have not to investigate the potential interaction between genotype and medical use history.","Anticipated Findings
Conducting the described research study could yield several anticipated findings that can contribute significantly to the field of delirium, pharmacogenomics, and the potential interaction between medication use and genetic predispositions. Findings may reveal a lower prevalence of delirium among individuals with a history of metformin use compared to those without such a history, particularly among those with diabetes mellitus. In addition, findings might indicate a differential effect of metformin on individuals with different genetic predispositions towards delirium. Overall, the anticipated findings from this research study could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between metformin use, genetic factors, and the pathophysiology of delirium, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical care, risk assessment, and potentially the development of targeted interventions for preventing or managing delirium in at-risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

(i) Which specific genetic variants predispose people to being more vulnerable to delirium?
(ii) Which modifiable risk factors and circulating proteins affect risk of delirium?
(iii) Is delirium a cause and/or consequence of dementia and frailty?
Delirium is an acute neurocognitive disorder that affects up to 50% of hospitalized patients over the age of 65. Delirium can be thought of as 'acute brain failure,' with serious consequences for patients including longer hospital stays and greater risk of cognitive and functional decline, and death. It remains unclear if delirium is an early sign of dementia/frailty or a modifiable mediator. There is a need to improve current prevention and treatment strategies, which starts with a better understanding of the underlying risk factors and biological mechanisms precipitating delirium. Genetic studies may help offer new insights into pathogenesis, help disentangle complex relationships with dementia and frailty, and uncover novel drug targets.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (delirium)
Drug Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
First, we will characterize the association between common (MAF>0.005) genetic variants and delirium status (any history of hospitalized delirium episode) by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within each ancestry using a logistic mixed model (SAIGE) and adjusting for age, sex, and top genetic principal components. Results from ancestry-specific GWAS will be combined via meta-analysis (MANTRA and METAL). Second, using the resulting summary statistics, we will perform Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to identify putative mediators of delirium including (a) modifiable risk factors (e.g. physical activity) and (b) druggable circulating proteins (e.g. inflammatory cytokines). Third, MR will also be used to assess potential bidirectional relationships between delirium vs. dementia and frailty. Finally, to corroborate genes identified by GWAS, rare variant association testing will be conducted testing rare mutation burden of each gene with delirium status (SAIGE-GENE) .","Anticipated Findings
Some individuals may have more fragile vs. resilient brains as a result of genetic predisposition. For example, it is known that homozygote APOE ε4 carriers are at four-fold elevated risk of delirium but beyond the APOE locus, no other genetic variations have been consistently associated despite strong estimated heritability. Accordingly, our study will contribute to identifying novel genetic risk factors for delirium. It will also help prioritize causal modifiable risk factors to help better inform public health policies for prevention in the elderly. This study will also help better elucidate the mechanisms and specific circulating proteins mediating risk of delirium, which may lead to the development of the first effective pharmacotherapies to treat delirium. Finally, GWAS results could be operationalized into polygenic risk scores which could complement and enhance existing clinical risk prediction models for delirium by capturing an innate component of brain vulnerability.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. Significant Association: The study may reveal a statistically significant association between specific variants of the APOE gene (e.g., ε4 allele) and an increased risk of developing ADRD. This finding would corroborate previous research highlighting APOE as a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and potentially for other related dementias as well.
2. Allelic Effects: There may be differences in the strength of the association between different APOE alleles (e.g., ε2, ε3, ε4) and ADRD risk.

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups.

The APOE4 allele is the major susceptibility gene for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at older ages. APOE has 3 common alleles (APOE2, 3 &4), giving rise to 6 genotypes (APOE2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 2/4, 3/4 & 4/4). In comparison to APOE3/3, the most common genotype, each copy of the APOE4 allele is associated with higher risk of AD dementia & younger median age at dementia onset. The impact of APOE4 on risk, rate of decline, & differential effects of the first AD-modifying disease medications has begun to have a major impact on the fight against AD. Recent studies in relatively small cohorts raised the possibility that APOE4 has a smaller impact on AD risk in African American/Black & Hispanic/Latino than in non-Hispanic persons. Confirming that possibility in large real-world cohort could have major implications for research & care in these underrepresented groups, as well as efforts to discover protective mechanisms that could be targeted by future AD-modifying & prevention therapies.","Project Purpose(s)

We proposed to capitalize on longitudinal real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from All of Us to characterize differential risk of progressing to clinical diagnosis of probable AD dementia in APOE4 carriers, including homozygote (HM, 4/4), heterozygote (HT, 3/4) & non-carriers (NC, 3/3) in African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino & non-Hispanic participants. Data from participants with these genotypes who are initially ages 60-80, don’t have initial diagnosis of AD dementia & have 5+ years of subsequent EHR data. Survival analyses will control for potential confounds of age, sex, education & if available an indicator of SES. To test our hypothesis with improved statistical power, we will combine HM & HT into an aggregate APOE4 carrier group, compare survival from AD dementia in initial analysis & control for the potential confound of differences among ethnic/racial groups in the carrier group. Exploratory analyses characterize HM vs NC & HT vs NC in the 3 ethnic/racial groups.","Anticipated Findings

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neurodevelopment (including conditions like autism and ADHD), genetic markers of such conditions, and neurodegeneration (including dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s). We will examine the role of several intervenable targets between neurodevelopmental and neurodegeneration. These lifestyle factors are known to impact neurodegeneration in the general population, but their role in people with neurodevelopmental conditions is unknown. The purpose of examining these factors is to examine if the risk of cognitive decline may be mitigated via improvements to these targets. These include cardiometabolic health (including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes), cognitive reserve (including higher education levels), physical activity, and accelerated biological aging.","Project Purpose(s)

We will compare rates of neurodegenerative disorders across people with genetic liability for autism, ADHD, and ID, identified via polygenic risk scores, which will be expressed as a z-score based on the mean/standard deviation. We will examine data across the life course for evidence that genetic risk for neurodevelopmental conditions is linked to neurodegeneration and we will estimate the genetic correlation between the two using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression. We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle. We will use DNA methylation data to construct epigenetic clocks to examine accelerated aging. We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings
Preliminary studies have suggested neurodegeneration may be more pronounced in people with neurodevelopmental conditions. The ultimate purpose of this research is to increase understanding of neurodegeneration risk in people with neurodevelopmental conditions, with an eye towards modifiable factors. We will also examine the genetic link between genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, which may illuminate causal pathways to neurodegeneration. Using high-resolution phenotyping available in All of Us uniquely allows the examination of early-onset degeneration. This is important, as early-onset degeneration may be a target for intervention. Other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and cardiovascular health, may also be important targets for intervention. These explorations hope to improve public health.

Anticholinergic (AC) drugs are medications used to treat various conditions like depression, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and bladder problems, especially as people age and develop more health issues. Over time, the use of these medications has increased significantly, particularly among frail older adults. However, AC medications can sometimes lead to problems like confusion, memory loss, and falls in older individuals. Therefore, it's important to develop tools that can help doctors estimate a person's AC medication use and predict their risk of experiencing these side effects. A tool called the AC Medication Index (ACMI) was recently developed using the UK 'Connected Bradford' general practice database. This tool helps identify patients at high risk of experiencing side effects from AC medications, such as delirium or falls. We are now using this tool to study the connection between AC medication use and dementia using the UK Biobank and All of Us Research Program data.","Project Purpose(s)

We are utilizing the UK Biobank which is a large population-based prospective cohort study with comprehensive genetic and phenotypic data, that includes linked primary health care records for ~230,000 participants. We are using cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for clinical and genetic factors, to quantify the association between baseline annual anticholinergic burden (computed using the ACMI, among other anticholinergic burden scales) and the risk of dementia. Additionally, we are using PLINK to create a genetic risk score based on genes involved in the Acetylcholine signalling pathway, with the UK Biobank as the base cohort. This score will be tested using data from the All of Us Research Program, which will be the test cohort.","Anticipated Findings
A validated genetic risk score is the expected outcome of this study. This score should improve how anticholinergic medications are prescribed, reducing the risk of harmful side effects and ultimately improving quality of life and clinical outcomes while saving costs for individuals and society.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide. However, about half of cancer cases are preventable as they are linked to modifiable risk factors. The identification of individuals at high risk for cancer can help enhance the efficiency of cancer screening and develop effective cancer prevention programs. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used for cancer prediction, including the prediction of cancer susceptibility (i.e., risk assessment), with acceptable performance reported before. However, few studies have explored cancer risk prediction for people with multimorbidity, including those with cognitive impairment such as dementia, who face challenges in health self-management and care decision-making. Research questions of this study are focused on (1) what are high-ranked risk factors for breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers? (2) how do these risk factors differ between people with dementia (and/or mild cognitive impairment) and those without?","Project Purpose(s)

We are interested in the link between sleep health and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). While polysomnography (PSG; the traditional in-lab sleep study) is generally considered the ""gold-standard"" of sleep measurement, in-lab sleep measurement can have high costs, be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and may not always reflect in-home sleep habits. The All of Us dataset provides a valuable opportunity to investigate in-home sleep measurement using wearable technology (Fitbit). This allows investigators like ourselves to examine real-world sleep health in a large, diverse cohort of individuals. By doing so, we hope to add to the current understanding of how sleep health relates to neurodegenerative diseases, and how this link may differ across populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians. The Li Lab here at UC Irvine uses a variety of computational methods to find different types of genomic patterns in an unbiased manner. With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging.

Iron has essential biological functions but too much can result in the iron overload disease hemochromatosis. This is predominantly caused by mutations in the HFE gene, especially the p.C282Y genetic variant. However, patients experience dramatically different disease trajectories, and we have studied factors influencing outcomes in the UK Biobank (PMIDs: 30651232 & 35567766), including the first report that those with two copies of this mutation have increased risk of dementia (doi:10.3233/jad-201080). Yet whether this extends to other populations is unknown. We aim to study participants with combinations of the HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D variants in the All of Us cohort to characterise penetrance of these iron overload associated genetic variants to key outcomes (liver disease, dementia) plus investigate modifiers of the penetrance, including non-HFE genetic variants known to increase iron levels, plus obesity, and other risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

Health outcomes will be ascertained from the OMOP data, especially liver disease (the severe clinical outcome of iron overload) but also dementia. We will use `Plink` to extract genotype information, and `R` to perform the statistical analyses. We will utilize the following participant information, where available, to characterise the genotype carriers and include as risk factors/covariates: age, sex, obesity, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.","Anticipated Findings

This will contribute to the literature by extending the finding to the US population, including more diverse populations. We anticipate clarifying the effect of risk factors in the other (contested) genotype combination (such as C282Y-H63D compound heterozygotes).

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a complex spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms ranging from short-term memory lapses to the gradual loss of bodily functions leading to eventual demise. This condition significantly diminishes the quality of life for the affected older population. The widespread adoption and continual enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S have resulted in the accumulation of extensive longitudinal EHR datasets, providing valuable resources for clinical research. Numerous risk factors associated with AD, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, are routinely documented in patients' EHRs.

We will develop models to predict the risk for neurological complications. In particular, we will use the numeric output that before the softmax in the final binary output as the risk of the predicted neuro-PASC or ADRD-PASC. In addition, we will also consider the predicted hazards, the output from the survival outcome predictions. Also, to maximize the information captured by our deep learning models, we will also use the neurons in the hidden layer as endophenotypes for neuro-PASC and ADRD-PASC. For all phenotypes, we will conduct single-phenotype GWAS association tests using linear mixed models.
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia are already an important national priority and Neurological complications of PASC (neuro-PASC) are important as they are a major category of PASC. Finding the related genetic factors behind these two disease can be crucial in the management of  early detection.","Project Purpose(s)

minority groups.
Research Methods and Methods : We train a deep learning-based model on COVID-19 patients’ data available through the N3C initiative. As an outcome, the model will learn a phenotypic representation that consists of the patient's risk to develop post COVID complications, including neuropsychiatric complications Afterwards, we will transfer the model to the All of Us researcher platform and apply our model to create the phenotypic  representation for the 11,767 COVID-19 patients using their EHR data.

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.
The goal of this demonstration project is to validate previous research showing potential interactions between dementia, diabetes, and hypertension, with an explicit consideration of race/ ethnicity.","Project Purpose(s)

Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Genetic research has greatly increased our knowledge for the genetic basis of this disease, however despite this, we have made little headway in the discovery of disease modifying or preventative therapeutics. Additionally, genetic research for AD, as well as other diseases, is dominated by those of European ancestry. To address these issues, we are focussing on 2 scientific questions.
1. Are there genetic modifiers that affect risk for developing AD in carriers of the APOE e4 genotype? Having just one copy of the APOE e4 genotype greatly increases the risk for developing AD, however, many people possess two copies of the APOE e4 genotype and never develop AD.
2. What variants affect AD risk for non-European populations? Leveraging different LD patterns, we can increase the power to detect additional risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia)","Scientific Approaches
Our plan to address these 2 questions is through a series of meta-analyses and follow-up work. The plan for question 1 is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study of AD in APOE e4 carriers only. We will use the AllofUs genetic datasets as well as the demographics age, sex, and AD disease status. We will use Plink software to carry out this analysis. We will then meta-analyze these results with summary statistics from other AD cohorts. Follow-up will include FUMA and gene burden tests to further investigate any potential findings. The plan for question 2 is to perform a Trans-Ancestry Meta Analysis to nominate new risk variants. We will use Plink to perform GWAS is populations that have been defined by genetic ancestry, and then will use MR-MEGA software to meta-analyze the summary statistics in order to nominate new risk variants that may have different effects on disease risk in different ancestry populations.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are two-fold: the first is to nominate genetic variants that effect AD risk in APOE e4 carriers. This is one of many important steps on the journey to precision medicine. It is unlikely that we will find a therapeutic that works for all types of AD and dementia. Instead, we must focus on specific types of disease. By discovering additional genetic modifiers of risk (why do some APOE e4 carriers not get AD?) we can potentially nominate new targets that have a better chance at disease modification. Second, we need to make an active effort as a research community to include non-European populations in genetic research. Much less is known about the genetic basis of AD in non-European populations. We aim to nominate new AD risk variants that are present in multiple and different populations so that we can increase our knowledge and treatment of those populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

CADASIL/NOTCH3 genetic variants in the general population,"CADASIL is a slow onset, rare genetic disease caused by NOTCH3 gene variants, leading to lesions in the white matter of the brain, migraines, recurrent strokes and dementia/memory loss.

CADASIL is a slow onset, rare genetic disease caused by NOTCH3 gene variants, leading to lesions in the white matter of the brain, migraines, recurrent strokes and dementia/memory loss. Not only is CADASIL genotypically diverse (variants span the whole gene), it is also phenotypically heterogeneous with individuals that have the same variant presenting with very different symptoms as well as variable diseases progression. Lastly, current treatments are palliative and there is little prospect of future therapies to directly address causation and block progression of the disease.
We hypothesize that this heterogeneity is partially driven by risk factors, lifestyle, environmental components and genetic modifiers. This database will enable us to identify the frequency and the distribution of NOTCH3 variants in the enrolled population as well as use available demographic, lifestyle and genetic data to parse out potential disease modifiers that may alter the course of CADASIL.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to access the All of Us Research genetic data to identify the presence of NOTCH3 variants in study subjects to create a CADASIL Cohort and determine the frequency and the distribution of these variants in the enrolled study population. If available, we will analyze demographic, medical history, imaging and cognitive function data to understand the impact of those factors on each NOTCH3 variant. We also plan to use available genomic data to identify the frequency of potential genetic modifiers that are known (per literature) to play a role in vascular dementia conditions that, if overlapping with a NOTCH3 mutation, could explain the heterogeneity of CADASIL.","Anticipated Findings
We believe that the data will show that NOTCH3 variants are likely more frequent in the general sampled population than previously determined and that there may be a correlation between the genetic location of these variants and various risk factors/modifiers that may elucidate the observed heterogeneity of the CADASIL phenotype. Particularly, we want to focus on studying common and well understood variants of CADASIL to try to identify other genetic and environmental factors that may be associated with severe outcomes using machine learning approaches to parse through clinical laboratory data (lipid levels, hypertension, etc.). Lastly, in our own cohort of CADASIL patients, we have identified some patients with sleep apnea and would like to look at the All of Us Research database for individuals that wear an activity tracker capable of recording sleep data.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide. However, about half of cancer cases are preventable as they are linked to modifiable risk factors. The identification of individuals at high risk for cancer can help enhance the efficiency of cancer screening and develop effective cancer prevention programs. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used for cancer prediction, including the prediction of cancer susceptibility (i.e., risk assessment), with acceptable performance reported before. However, few studies have explored cancer risk prediction for people with multimorbidity, including those with cognitive impairment such as dementia, who face challenges in health self-management and care decision-making. Research questions of this study are focused on (1) what are high-ranked risked factors for breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers? (2) how do these risk factors differ between people with dementia (and/or mild cognitive impairment) and those without?","Project Purpose(s)

Advances in the ability to predict disease using genetics have been enabled by large genome wide association studies and methods that can combine multiple genetic risk factors such as polygenic risk scores (PRS). The predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores for dementia has predominantly been studied in cohorts where phenotypes have been defined by autopsy or strict clinical diagnostic criteria. In practice, healthcare providers diagnose dementia during life without reviewing strict diagnostic criteria. Healthcare provider inform patients of their diagnosis and/or enter these diagnoses in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition, many polygenic risk dementia studies have been performed in individuals of European ancestry. Our objective is to evaluate polygenic risk scores for dementia based on phenotypes from the EHR among different ancestry groups. Improving genetic predictive models of dementia can aid in early diagnosis and treatment of dementias.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia globally. Furthermore, identifying non-invasive biomarkers through blood samples can revolutionize early detection and management of AD, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare burdens. We aim to explore the data to uncover potential correlations between the intra-microbiome, brain mutations, and blood markers. This exploration is crucial to formalize a research question that can offer insights into the pathogenesis of AD and provide non-invasive diagnostic solutions.
Scientific Questions in this Study:
-Does the intra-microbiome play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in brain tissue?
-Are there detectable mutations in the brain (originating from the ectoderm layer) that are associated with AD, and can these be correlated with markers in blood samples (originating from the mesoderm)?

I hope to answer whether speech/gait profiles can differentiate dementia types. The escalating pervasiveness of dementia has placed a huge burden on the health and social care systems, making accurate identification of dementia crucial. The differential identification of dementia types in clinical settings relies heavily on the combination of expensive neuroimaging panel and invasive biomarker testing, which makes it difficult to apply such exams to every person with cognitive complaints. In addition, similar cognitive symptoms among these dementia types leave clinicians to the challenging task of differentiating the type of dementia. The analysis of speech/gait markers may lead to the development of a non-invasive and cost-efficient tool for differential diagnosis of dementia. This will assist healthcare professionals in identifying the ever-increasing cognitive conditions to facilitate the development of appropriate treatments and managements plans, tailored to each type of dementia.","Project Purpose(s)

Treatments for breast and other cancers are often associated with short term cognitive losses. In the long term, however, individuals diagnosed with cancer are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). The reverse is also true; individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer. An improved understanding of how the patterns of inverse comorbidity between the two conditions develop and why the patterns exist will give women diagnosed with cancer accurate information about likely cognitive outcomes and reveal mechanisms
(e.g., related to the immune system) that will allow for the reduction of AD/ADRD risk.
It is especially important that the relationship between cancer and AD/ADRD be disentangled in populations that are diverse across a number of dimensions.
We thus propose to evaluate the patterns of cancer and AD/ADRD diagnosis in All of Us, as well as two large population based cohorts.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to conduct initial analyses by generating polygenic risk scores (PRS) for individual participants based on published GWAS risk variants for 18 individual cancer types and Alzheimer's disease.","Anticipated Findings

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with a huge burden on the society and healthcare system. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States with no effective treatment. Early-onset AD is caused by fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. Late onset AD is caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors with APOE as the strongest genetic risk factor. However, a significant proportion of the elderly remains cognitively intact despite the presence of amyloid-b, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation. We aim to apply our expertise in genetics, artificial intelligence and molecular cell biology to identify risk and protective genetic variants and their combinations to better evaluate and predict risk, resilience and age-of-onset in Alzheimer's disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will define and use a cohort of AD cases and controls to identify associations with genetic variants. We will use tools optimized for large-scale analyses, such as PLINK, regenie and FBAT. In particular, we will use family-based approaches to analyze a subset of related individuals. We will perform both: single variant and region-based (for WES and WGS) analyses.  Regions will be selected based on variant impact and/or consecutive windows. Furthermore, we will perform stratification by specific variables of interest, such as ethnicity, sex and APOE, and calculate effect estimates in those groups. We will combine these results with other WGS AD and centenarian datasets in a meta-analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to identify new AD risk and/or protective loci with associated rare and low-frequency variants and stratified genetic associations, such as sex- or APOE- specific AD loci. Such loci associated with AD risk and/or cognitive resilience will be then tested using 3D brain models to characterize functional mechanisms. These results are of potential great value and can lead to effective early intervention of AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

An antemortem diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) requires costly techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) or invasive methods like measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Other types of dementia like Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) currently have no identified biomarkers comparable to the PET and CSF measures in AD.
Wearable devices have the potential to serve as inexpensive and non-invasive ways to predict dementia type.  Passive collection is also well-suited for elderly individuals, as it avoids relying on subjective recollection and does not interfere with their day-to-day activities.
We will evaluate the ability of machine learning models using wearable devices to predict the type of dementia.

2. Map the raw data to derived traits of physical activity and sleep, matching the fitness tracker data measured on the prospective cohort.
3. Account for differences between the prospective study fitness trackers’ digital features and the accelerometer-derived features by having controls wear the two devices concomitantly and generating mapping functions to account for device differences.
4. Generate machine learning models on large datasets and use a transfer-learning methodology to transfer the learned models to the prospective cohort. These machine learning models will be stratified based on sex and comorbidities (e.g., heart problems).","Anticipated Findings

The genetic etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is poorly understood. Somatic mutations in the brains with AD and other neurological disorders have been established as a potential mechanism for their pathophysiology. Somatic transposable elements (TEs) are prevalent in individual neurons in the human brain's cerebral cortex, a region long associated with AD progression. Recent work has shown a connection between AD-associated Tau protein-mediated mechanisms with TE activity and somatic mutations. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated TE's role and genomic impact in AD and related dementias in the survey of large-scale cohorts.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Genetic research has greatly increased our knowledge for the genetic basis of this disease, however despite this, we have made little headway in the discovery of disease modifying or preventative therapeutics. Additionally, genetic research for AD, as well as other diseases, is dominated by those of European ancestry. To address these issues, we are focussing on 2 scientific questions.
1. Are there genetic modifiers that affect risk for developing AD in carriers of the APOE e4 genotype? Having just one copy of the APOE e4 genotype greatly increases the risk for developing AD, however, many people possess two copies of the APOE e4 genotype and never develop AD.
2. What variants affect AD risk for non-European populations? Leveraging different LD patterns, we can increase the power to detect additional risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia)","Scientific Approaches
Our plan to address these 2 questions is through a series of meta-analyses and follow-up work. The plan for question 1 is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study of AD in APOE e4 carriers only. We will use the AllofUs genetic datasets as well as the demographics age, sex, and AD disease status. We will use Plink software to carry out this analysis. We will then meta-analyze these results with summary statistics from other AD cohorts. Follow-up will include FUMA and gene burden tests to further investigate any potential findings. The plan for question 2 is to perform a Trans-Ancestry Meta Analysis to nominate new risk variants. We will use Plink to perform GWAS is populations that have been defined by genetic ancestry, and then will use MR-MEGA software to meta-analyze the summary statistics in order to nominate new risk variants that may have different effects on disease risk in different ancestry populations.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are two-fold: the first is to nominate genetic variants that effect AD risk in APOE e4 carriers. This is one of many important steps on the journey to precision medicine. It is unlikely that we will find a therapeutic that works for all types of AD and dementia. Instead, we must focus on specific types of disease. By discovering additional genetic modifiers of risk (why do some APOE e4 carriers not get AD?) we can potentially nominate new targets that have a better chance at disease modification. Second, we need to make an active effort as a research community to include non-European populations in genetic research. Much less is known about the genetic basis of AD in non-European populations. We aim to nominate new AD risk variants that are present in multiple and different populations so that we can increase our knowledge and treatment of those populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Oral Health and Dementia,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest
