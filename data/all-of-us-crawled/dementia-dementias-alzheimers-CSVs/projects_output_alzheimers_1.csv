My research interest lies in delving into the intricate relationship between environmental metal exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) among the elderly population. I am driven by specific scientific questions that aim to uncover the potential links between exposure to environmental metals and the initiation or progression of these neurodegenerative disorders. One of the central aspects of my research involves assessing the contribution of environmental metal exposure to the risk of developing AD and ADRD in the elderly. Metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum, arsenic, copper, magnesium commonly found in the environment, have the potential to accumulate in the body over time. Understanding this association is vital for identifying preventive measures and interventions to safeguard cognitive health in aging populations.","Project Purpose(s)

60-80% of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) risk is heritable.  Both genetic and environmental factors are responsible for the development and progression of LOAD. Many LOAD susceptibility genes have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While genetic factors contribute significantly to the risk of developing LOAD, the impact of environmental factors on the disease remains multifaceted. We propose a research proposal that assesses gene-environment (G×E) interactions in LOAD to analyze All of Us data. We will test these hypotheses: 1) individuals with the same or lower genetic risks will face an increased risk for LOAD when modified by higher environmental risks (vulnerability), whereas those with the same or higher genetic risks will experience a reduced risk when influenced by lower environmental risks (resilience); 2) effects of genetic risks on LOAD will vary modified by midlife and later-life environmental risks across ethnoracial groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are well-established in LOAD studies and feature an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to LOAD by aggregating genetic effects of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), thus serving as a comprehensive score for genetic risks. We will examine the interactions between PRSs and each of environmental risk factors in LOAD. We will also use an item response theory (IRT)-based model to generate environmental risk scores (ERSs) and investigate the interactions between PRSs and midlife/later-life ERSs in LOAD across ethnoracial groups. We will utilize the All of Us genetic data and published GWAS summary statistics to construct LOAD PRSs and construct midlife and later-life ERSs based on various environmental indicators in the All of Us data, including social of determinants of health (e.g., education and incomes), physical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and depression), and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol, and exercise) variables.","Anticipated Findings
Overall, we will examine one-by-one G×E interactions in LOAD, but also construct comprehensive scores, PRSs and midlife/later-life ERSs, for individuals across ethnoracial groups, collectively contributing to advancing our knowledge of G×E interactions on vulnerability and resilience to LOAD. Informed by data indicating an overall risk (PRS modified by ERS) for LOAD, this approach may enable clinicians and individuals to initiate disease screening and discuss life planning strategies. This study would also provide a crucial tool for informing the design and implementation of personalized therapeutic and preventative programs, enabling more precise and individualized approaches to the treatment and prevention of LOAD. This study not only enhances our understanding of progression of LOAD but also provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate risk and bolster resilience, thereby advancing personalized interventions for diverse populations at different life stages.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How does anxiety disorder affect the chances of developing Alzheimer's disease? Alzheimer's Disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 6 million individuals in the United States and 55 million people worldwide. Recent research has found many risk factors associated with the development of Alzheimer's Disease, one of them being anxiety disorder. However, the relationship between anxiety disorder and Alzheimer's Disease is still somewhat unknown. I plan to research the relationship between Alzheimer's Disease.","Project Purpose(s)

I plan on comparing the APOE e4 gene in those with Alzheimer's disease, those with anxiety, and a control group. I will also be reviewing current research on anxiety and Alzheimer's Disease.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate finding a connection between Alzheimer's disease and anxiety and be able to greater pinpoint why. Understanding the link between Anxiety disorder and Alzheimer’s Disease better can help future research on preventing future cases of AD, and understanding the development of AD better. Knowing you are at a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease because of anxiety disorder may be enough for people to become proactive about their health and do things that are known to help prevent or delay the onset of AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I intend to study how polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease correlate with various wearable data, such as sleep patterns and heart rate among healthy individuals. This research is necessary because it aims to shed light on the potential early indicators or risk factors for Alzheimer's disease before symptoms appear. By understanding how genetic predisposition interacts with lifestyle factors, we can potentially identify interventions or preventive measures to delay or mitigate the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
I am exploring the data to formalize a specific research question at this stage because I believe wearable data can provide valuable insights into the early stages of Alzheimer's disease development. The scientific question I hope to answer using the data is whether individuals with a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's disease exhibit distinct sleep and heart rate patterns compared to those with a lower risk score.","Project Purpose(s)

I will select a cohort of healthy individuals with available SNP genotype or whole-genome sequence data and additional datasets such as Fitbit data,  social determinants of health, and/or Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
I will adapt previously published Polygenic Risk Scores (PGSs)  to compute individual PGS for Alzheimer's disease by utilizing genetic data.
I will gather wearable (Fitbit) data, including but not limited to sleep patterns and heart rate. This data will provide insights into participants' daily activities and physiological parameters.
I will examine the relationship between PGS for Alzheimer's disease and wearable data. This may involve correlation analysis and regression modeling to identify patterns and associations within the data.
I will integrate EHR data into the analysis to supplement the wearable data and provide additional context and clinical information.","Anticipated Findings
1. The study may reveal correlations between polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease and various wearable data such as sleep patterns and heart rate.
2. Certain patterns or changes in wearable data may emerge as potential early biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease risk.
3. The study findings could offer insights into the underlying mechanisms linking genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease with physiological changes captured by wearable devices.
4. By identifying potential early indicators of Alzheimer's disease risk, the study could inform the development of preventive strategies or early intervention approaches. This could ultimately lead to improved clinical management and better outcomes for individuals at risk of developing the disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Non-invasive and low-cost tools for early detection of individuals at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are of crucial importance. While genetic studies (GWAS) exist, most focus on European populations, limiting their application to diverse groups. Given the Eurocentric biases in GWASs, PRSs are better at predicting AD risk for European ancestry as opposed to others. This research addresses this gap by developing a multimodal hazard score (MHS) that incorporates ethnically and genetically diverse populations. Our team established a successful polygenic hazard score (PHS) that predicts AD onset in European cohorts. Higher PHS predicted greater cognitive decline in CN, entorhinal cortex volume loss and predicted conversion from cognitively normal (CN), to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.  This suggests its potential as a robust genetic risk indicator to be included in the MHS while also looking into diverse populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
Leveraging data from the different AD cohorts, we will conduct Cox proportional models to develop the MHS combining age, PHS, brain atrophy, biofluid-based data, and clinical outcomes to predict neurocognitive decline trajectory. This score will be able to predict AD progression and identify individuals at high risk of transitioning from cognitive normalcy to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventually AD in a generalizable population. Additionally, we will also compute power calculations to estimate required clinical trial sample sizes after hypothetical enrichment using the MHS. Finally, we aim to replicate these findings in other diverse cohorts to ensure broader applicability.","Anticipated Findings
We believe this MHS surpasses single-modal and European data-driven models in predicting AD for diverse populations. This could pave the way for earlier intervention, more efficient research, and ultimately, improved outcomes for individuals at risk of AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups.

The APOE4 allele is the major susceptibility gene for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at older ages. APOE has 3 common alleles (APOE2, 3 &4), giving rise to 6 genotypes (APOE2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 2/4, 3/4 & 4/4). In comparison to APOE3/3, the most common genotype, each copy of the APOE4 allele is associated with higher risk of AD dementia & younger median age at dementia onset. The impact of APOE4 on risk, rate of decline, & differential effects of the first AD-modifying disease medications has begun to have a major impact on the fight against AD. Recent studies in relatively small cohorts raised the possibility that APOE4 has a smaller impact on AD risk in African American/Black & Hispanic/Latino than in non-Hispanic persons. Confirming that possibility in large real-world cohort could have major implications for research & care in these underrepresented groups, as well as efforts to discover protective mechanisms that could be targeted by future AD-modifying & prevention therapies.","Project Purpose(s)

We proposed to capitalize on longitudinal real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from All of Us to characterize differential risk of progressing to clinical diagnosis of probable AD dementia in APOE4 carriers, including homozygote (HM, 4/4), heterozygote (HT, 3/4) & non-carriers (NC, 3/3) in African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino & non-Hispanic participants. Data from participants with these genotypes who are initially ages 60-80, don’t have initial diagnosis of AD dementia & have 5+ years of subsequent EHR data. Survival analyses will control for potential confounds of age, sex, education & if available an indicator of SES. To test our hypothesis with improved statistical power, we will combine HM & HT into an aggregate APOE4 carrier group, compare survival from AD dementia in initial analysis & control for the potential confound of differences among ethnic/racial groups in the carrier group. Exploratory analyses characterize HM vs NC & HT vs NC in the 3 ethnic/racial groups.","Anticipated Findings

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neurodevelopment (including conditions like autism and ADHD), genetic markers of such conditions, and neurodegeneration (including dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s). We will examine the role of several intervenable targets between neurodevelopmental and neurodegeneration. These lifestyle factors are known to impact neurodegeneration in the general population, but their role in people with neurodevelopmental conditions is unknown. The purpose of examining these factors is to examine if the risk of cognitive decline may be mitigated via improvements to these targets. These include cardiometabolic health (including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes), cognitive reserve (including higher education levels), physical activity, and accelerated biological aging.","Project Purpose(s)

Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will compare rates of neurodegenerative disorders across people with genetic liability for autism, ADHD, and ID, identified via polygenic risk scores, which will be expressed as a z-score based on the mean/standard deviation. We will examine data across the life course for evidence that genetic risk for neurodevelopmental conditions is linked to neurodegeneration and we will estimate the genetic correlation between the two using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression. We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle. We will use DNA methylation data to construct epigenetic clocks to examine accelerated aging. We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings
Preliminary studies have suggested neurodegeneration may be more pronounced in people with neurodevelopmental conditions. The ultimate purpose of this research is to increase understanding of neurodegeneration risk in people with neurodevelopmental conditions, with an eye towards modifiable factors. We will also examine the genetic link between genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, which may illuminate causal pathways to neurodegeneration. Using high-resolution phenotyping available in All of Us uniquely allows the examination of early-onset degeneration. This is important, as early-onset degeneration may be a target for intervention. Other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and cardiovascular health, may also be important targets for intervention. These explorations hope to improve public health. Overall, this study aims to expand our understanding of dementia in neurodivergent people, with the ultimate goal of improving health and well-being.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The proposed method utilizes a SNP network to capture interactions between genetic variants based on linkage disequilibrium scores. The network represents the complex relationships among genetic factors. Feature propagation, a technique that refines genetic variant information based on graph neural networks (GNNs), is then employed to predict AD risk scores. Meanwhile, following the concept of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), brain imaging endophenotypes enhance prediction power and identify significant regions affecting specific diseases. Moreover, a generative artificial intelligence model is applied to produce pseudo-imaging endophenotypes for samples with only genetic information.","Anticipated Findings
The proposed method will be applied to data including (i) both genetic and brain imaging information from two datasets: UK Biobank (UKBB), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and (ii) only genetic information from the All of Us research program (AoU). The results will be cross-validated from the two datasets (UKBB and ADNI), and a generative model will be applied to AoU. The final prediction results will be compared with other models, including the polygenic risk score–continuous shrinkage (PRS-CS) model.
The insights gained into the relationship between genetics, brain structure, and diseases are expected to advance our knowledge of disease progression and inform future research and clinical strategies for preventing and managing these conditions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

For this study, I plan to employ a multifaceted scientific approach that combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with quantitative and qualitative research methods. To begin, EDA will serve as the cornerstone, allowing me to gain valuable insights and uncover hidden patterns within the datasets collected through survey questionnaires. These datasets will encompass a wide range of lifestyle factors, including dietary habits, physical activity, cognitive engagement, and social interactions among individuals with Alzheimer's. Qualitative research methods, such as interviews or open-ended survey questions, will complement the quantitative analyses, enabling a deeper understanding of the personal experiences and perspectives of individuals living with Alzheimer's.

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To address the scientific question of exploring Alzheimer's genetic data in underrepresented populations, particularly focusing on variants associated with AD in the African American population, we will employ the following methods:
Data Preprocessing and Quality Control: Perform quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the genetic data. Filter out variants with low quality scores, genotype call rates, and those that are not relevant.
Variant Calling and Analysis: Use bioinformatics tools such as GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) or SAMtools for variant calling and genotyping.
Association Studies: Utilize statistical methods such as logistic regression or linear mixed models to assess the association between genetic variants and disease phenotype while controlling for potential confounders.
Functional Annotation and Pathway Analysis: Annotate identified variants to understand their functional consequences (e.g., protein-coding changes, regulatory effects).","Anticipated Findings
Upon identifying variants associated with Alzheimer's disease in the African American population, we will annotate these variants to comprehensively understand their functional consequences.

We are interested in the link between sleep health and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). While polysomnography (PSG; the traditional in-lab sleep study) is generally considered the ""gold-standard"" of sleep measurement, in-lab sleep measurement can have high costs, be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and may not always reflect in-home sleep habits. The All of Us dataset provides a valuable opportunity to investigate in-home sleep measurement using wearable technology (Fitbit). This allows investigators like ourselves to examine real-world sleep health in a large, diverse cohort of individuals. By doing so, we hope to add to the current understanding of how sleep health relates to neurodegenerative diseases, and how this link may differ across populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Our study hypothesizes that early onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) exhibits a wide age range of onset due to its hereditary nature. We anticipate observing variations in the manifestation of EOAD across different races and genders. Our investigation suggests that pathogenic variants play a significant role in the development of this disease. Furthermore, we aim to explore the association between calculating polygenic risk scores and the occurrence of EOAD, seeking insights into the genetic factors contributing to its onset.
The anticipated findings would contribute significantly to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) in several ways:
1. Understanding age variability in EOAD onset.
2. Uncovering racial and gender disparities.
3. Exploring genetic factors.
4. Linking polygenic risk scores to disease occurrence.
5. Contributing to precision medicine.
6. Informing genetic counseling and early intervention.","Demographic Categories of Interest

All prevalent human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s or diabetes, are known to be driven by a complex combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Numerous genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of genetic variants to common diseases. By design, GWAS
only find associations with a disease but cannot reveal which genetic variants are causal within
associated regions of the genome.  Current “fine mapping” algorithms, which aim to
pinpoint the truly causal variants, fail if there are too many variants that are inherited together, which is
often the case. This project will develop a new fine mapping method that uses GWAS data to identify
combinations of genetic variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The new method is based on a mathematical approximation that makes it much faster than existing
algorithms. This speed advantage allows the method to exhaustively explore the large number of
possible combinations of variants and identify those that have a high probability of being causal. In this
project, the new method will be thoroughly benchmarked against state-of-the art methods on simulated
data, for which the ground truth is known. The method will also be extended to consider additional
information about the human genome, such as the position of genes or molecular characteristics that
control the expression of genes.","Anticipated Findings
Many novel disease-associated genetic variants that have been overlooked to date are expected to be discovered by the
new approach. The final goal of the project is to implement the method in a user-friendly software

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a complex spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms ranging from short-term memory lapses to the gradual loss of bodily functions leading to eventual demise. This condition significantly diminishes the quality of life for the affected older population. The widespread adoption and continual enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S have resulted in the accumulation of extensive longitudinal EHR datasets, providing valuable resources for clinical research. Numerous risk factors associated with AD, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, are routinely documented in patients' EHRs. This study endeavors to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to facilitate the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The focus is on utilizing real-world electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities in the realm of neurodegenerative disorders.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.

Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Objective: This study aims to quantify the link between antihypertensive therapies and Alzheimer's disease risk, expanding on the established relationship between primary hypertension and AD.
Introduction: Previous research has identified primary hypertension as a key risk factor for AD. Effective hypertension management may impact AD progression and cognitive decline.
Methods: Leveraging All of Us data, we'll longitudinally analyze individuals, stratifying by hypertension status. Those with primary hypertension will be categorized by antihypertensive drug class: Thiazide-type diuretics, Calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. We'll assess cognitive performance trajectories, adjusting for confounders, precision variables, and time-varying variables influenced by prior interventions. The confounders we will incorporate into our models will be derived by searching a biomedical knowledge graph derived from both the literature and biomedical ontologies.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Genetic research has greatly increased our knowledge for the genetic basis of this disease, however despite this, we have made little headway in the discovery of disease modifying or preventative therapeutics. Additionally, genetic research for AD, as well as other diseases, is dominated by those of European ancestry. To address these issues, we are focussing on 2 scientific questions.
1. Are there genetic modifiers that affect risk for developing AD in carriers of the APOE e4 genotype? Having just one copy of the APOE e4 genotype greatly increases the risk for developing AD, however, many people possess two copies of the APOE e4 genotype and never develop AD.
2. What variants affect AD risk for non-European populations? Leveraging different LD patterns, we can increase the power to detect additional risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia)","Scientific Approaches
Our plan to address these 2 questions is through a series of meta-analyses and follow-up work. The plan for question 1 is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study of AD in APOE e4 carriers only. We will use the AllofUs genetic datasets as well as the demographics age, sex, and AD disease status. We will use Plink software to carry out this analysis. We will then meta-analyze these results with summary statistics from other AD cohorts. Follow-up will include FUMA and gene burden tests to further investigate any potential findings. The plan for question 2 is to perform a Trans-Ancestry Meta Analysis to nominate new risk variants. We will use Plink to perform GWAS is populations that have been defined by genetic ancestry, and then will use MR-MEGA software to meta-analyze the summary statistics in order to nominate new risk variants that may have different effects on disease risk in different ancestry populations.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are two-fold: the first is to nominate genetic variants that effect AD risk in APOE e4 carriers. This is one of many important steps on the journey to precision medicine. It is unlikely that we will find a therapeutic that works for all types of AD and dementia. Instead, we must focus on specific types of disease. By discovering additional genetic modifiers of risk (why do some APOE e4 carriers not get AD?) we can potentially nominate new targets that have a better chance at disease modification. Second, we need to make an active effort as a research community to include non-European populations in genetic research. Much less is known about the genetic basis of AD in non-European populations. We aim to nominate new AD risk variants that are present in multiple and different populations so that we can increase our knowledge and treatment of those populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How effective is treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD) using donepezil, memantine, or both in combination based on the AllofUs dataset? Additionally, how often each of these different treatments administered to the general patient population in terms of sex at birth?
Through answering these questions, more data will be contributed to the existing literature on the effectiveness of these three therapies on a more diverse patient population. Additionally, the relationship between sex at birth and treatment administered to effectively treat the symptoms of AD will be analyzed. This will help determine if there is biased treatment administration based on sex at birth, and could help determine whether a treatment path seems to treat symptoms better depending on sex at birth.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
I plan to mainly use the ""Conditions"" dataset, the ""Drug exposure"" dataset. Using the AllofUs coding tools, I hope to compare all three drug combinations and how they were administered to participants of different sexes. Using an umbrella study design, I will look at the three different drug treatment options and attempt to determine a connection between the symptoms described by participants and their treatment course as well as how this relates to their sex at birth.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate finding that combination therapy is the most effecting treatment for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (based on the literature) and that this therapy is most effective in patients born female at birth. This is the expected outcome because of the literature recently researched, and because Alzheimer's disease occurs more often in females. Researching these questions in the AllofUs, data set will be contributed to the scientific knowledge by showing how these therapies impact a more diverse cohort of patients while also looking into the impact of sex at birth on Alzheimer's disease progression when using 3 different treatment pathways.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am interested in looking at any positive correlation between a history of blood transfusion + later development of Alzheimer's disease; I am working w/ the UKB database to compare data results for validation purposes and potential to correlate to imaging findings. The goal is to identify if there is a potential risk of blood-borne transmission of amyloid-like pathologies, like Alzheimer's. This is a question I developed following a recent JAMA article looking at the correlation between the risk of spontaneous ICHin blood transfusion recipients who received blood from later identified CAA+ patients (something that would not have been known at the time of donation). There is an increased risk of ICH and possible transmission of CAA via blood - given this relationship its possible amyloid-like pathology follows a similar pattern of previously unidentified transmission, especially given that patients who donate may not realize that they later on will develop Alzheimers.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)
Population Health
Control Set","Scientific Approaches
Datasets will include patients with a history of transfusion w/ and w/o the development of Alzheimer's, and patients with Alzheimer's w/ and w/o a history of both blood donation or transfusion recipients. Then we will analyze for any statistically significant correlation. If correlation is demonstrated we plan to validate against the UKB dataset, if validated we will correlate findings with imaging and polygenic risk stratification data. The big question is more - is there a correlation, if not then we may not move forward with further analysis as it likely wouldn't be indicated.","Anticipated Findings
My hypothesis is that there may be some positive correlation. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is not an identified (as of yet) transmissible element in blood transfusions for amyloid-B pathology, however, those studies have specifically looked for an identifiable element within patients' blood, e.g. some kind of biomarker of Alzhimer's that may indicate a patient's propensity for later development (like measuring high blood pressure as a correlate for increased cardiovascular disease risk). What has not been looked at is the rate or potential relationship between blood donation in presumably healthy patients who later develop Alzheimer's and the risk that their transfused recipients later develop Alzheimer's - this is largely because these diseases are slow progressing, and identification of amyloid-like neuropathology is usually post-mortem or after severe cognitive decline, meaning honestly the data to correlate is emerging.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will integrate genetic data with the electronic health records to analyze the underlying disease pathways. Specifically, we propose to investigate the time-varying effect genetic effect. The specific questions we will ask are:
1.	How does the time-varying genetic effect play a role in late onset Alzheimer’s diseases?
2.	Can we develop a framework to monitoring the potential sign of the late onset Alzheimer’s diseases before it is diagnosed?
3.	Integrated with other lab measurements and brain image resources, can we utilize deep learning to develop a unified system for the detection and prediction of Alzheimer’s diseases?
This study will focus on the statistical methodology development and applications using All of Us data. We anticipate that the proposed investigations  will contribute to novel statistical advances and a better understanding of the genetic structures associated with Alzheimer’s diseases.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will develop innovative statistical methods based on quantile regressions construct a reference system to monitoring the development of Alzheimer’s diseases. An intuitive idea would be growth chart to monitor the height and weight of a child and give the percentile of him/her in the cohort. By integrating genetic data with electronic health records, such as brain images and recognition tests, we will be able to build a more comprehensive system to describe the patient’s disease progression given the cohort as a reference. This will also help prevent or warn the appearance of the Alzheimer’s at an early stage. Technically speaking, we will use low-rank approximation, data integration, and quantile regression to achieve this goal. We will develop statistical estimation and inference tools to quantify the uncertainty, and illustrate the methods by applications in All of Us data.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to have contributions in statistical methodology and genetics. From a statistical perspective, integrating multi-source data is always a challenging task, due to the errors in the observed data and the heterogeneity caused by unmeasured confounders. We will use quantile regression, a robust way of modeling, to reduce the effect from data heterogeneity, and low-rank approximation, to extract the main feature from different types of the data (e.g., brain images, lab measurements). From a genetic perspective, it is novel and in need to investigating time-varying genetic effect, especially for aging-related diseases. Due to the increasing amount of patients suffered from Alzheimer’s diseases, analyzing the time-varying genetic effect, along with individual-specific EHR data, will greatly unfold the patient’s specific disease progressions and lead to more precise treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will be searching patient data to determine what form of the APOE gene they carry. Additionally, we are interested in regionality and ethnic differences in APOE gene prevalence. Through patient demographic information we will research if certain groups are at higher risk of carrying the APOE-4 gamete, and thus at a higher risk of later developing Alzheimer’s Disease. Similarly, we will compare gamete prevalence against comorbidities. The APOE gene does not affect Alzheimer’s Disease exclusively; it also is known to correlate with high cholesterol, heart disease, and more. From this information we will determine what other diseases or disorders may indicate a person has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. We would also like to research what lifestyle behaviors increase or decrease the risk of developing these APOE-related diseases and disorders.","Anticipated Findings
It is predicted that the results will show some cardiac comorbidities due to protein misfolding, and that preventative measures will be less effective for those with the APOE mutations.

We aim to explore the data to uncover potential correlations between the intra-microbiome, brain mutations, and blood markers. This exploration is crucial to formalize a research question that can offer insights into the pathogenesis of AD and provide non-invasive diagnostic solutions.
Scientific Questions in this Study:
-Does the intra-microbiome play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in brain tissue?
-Are there detectable mutations in the brain (originating from the ectoderm layer) that are associated with AD, and can these be correlated with markers in blood samples (originating from the mesoderm)?

The heritability of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is estimated between 60-80%, indicating a strong genetic component to susceptibility to AD; which differs between ancestral populations. Although genetic ancestry has been shown to modify an individual’s risk for AD, the majority of genome-wide association studies and models for the calculation of a polygenic risk score have utilized data derived from populations with mostly European ancestry. Furthermore, a well-defined model of an ancestry-informed PRS has yet to be established in admixed populations. We aim to utilize All of Us Research Program data along with data from other studies such as the NIH AD sequencing project to build improved models of AD risk in admixed populations. We hypothesize that an ancestry-informed model for polygenic risk will provide a more accurate representation of AD risk in individuals with admixed genetic ancestry, compared to models that have been built off homogenous ancestral populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Alongside data from other studies, we will use genetic data from the All of Us Research program to evaluate the local ancestry of known genetic risk factors of AD to determine whether risk models in admixed populations improve with the addition of ancestry information. This will be done by mapping local ancestry of known genetic risk factors of AD as well as global (genomic average) proportions of genetic ancestry across the genomes of the participants. We will then leverage AD diagnosis against the composition of local ancestry proportions. These data will be used to build the framework of an ancestry-informed PRS model. We will then employ a meta-analysis framework that has utility in both multiethnic and ethnic-specific analysis utilizing fixed or random effects models and assess phenotypic heterogeneity through Cochran's Q test when comparing prediction accuracy within and across self-identified racial or ethnic categories.","Anticipated Findings
We expect ancestry specific genetic modifiers of AD risk between populations, with risk further modified by proportions of local ancestry spread across the genomes of admixed individuals. Furthermore, we predict that the local ancestry of known genetic modifiers of AD risk differentially influences AD risk when considering global proportions of genetic ancestry as well as non-genetic risk factors of AD such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and social determinants of health. We also predict these data can be leveraged to build an ancestry specific polygenic risk model. We will publish these findings and share the weights used to develop the score (which can be performed in a privacy-preserving fashion) to ensure other parties can leverage our insights and improve biomedical research across AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will develop models to predict the risk for neurological complications. In particular, we will use the numeric output that before the softmax in the final binary output as the risk of the predicted neuro-PASC or ADRD-PASC. In addition, we will also consider the predicted hazards, the output from the survival outcome predictions. Also, to maximize the information captured by our deep learning models, we will also use the neurons in the hidden layer as endophenotypes for neuro-PASC and ADRD-PASC. For all phenotypes, we will conduct single-phenotype GWAS association tests using linear mixed models.
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia are already an important national priority and Neurological complications of PASC (neuro-PASC) are important as they are a major category of PASC. Finding the related genetic factors behind these two disease can be crucial in the management of  early detection.","Project Purpose(s)

Datasets: N3C is one of the richest data sources that include the electronic health records data for more than 5 million confirmed covid-19 patients from 74 sites
across the United States. All of Us is a unique source where we can access the genetic and clinical data for 100000 US patients and with higher representation for
minority groups.
Research Methods and Methods : We train a deep learning-based model on COVID-19 patients’ data available through the N3C initiative. As an outcome, the model will learn a phenotypic representation that consists of the patient's risk to develop post COVID complications, including neuropsychiatric complications Afterwards, we will transfer the model to the All of Us researcher platform and apply our model to create the phenotypic  representation for the all COVID-19 patients with their EHR data. Then, we will use the genotypic data for all Covid-19 patients who has both their genotype data and EHR data for the GWAS study.","Anticipated Findings
The goal is to bring breakthroughs in AI/ML for expedite discovery of the genetic basis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We expect to find associations between endophenotypes and SNPs related to Long Covid and Alzheimer's Disease.
The innovation of our project are as follows:
1. Using a transfer learning approach to leverage the large N3C data for phenotyping All of Us data is new.
2. We will be the first who leverage the All of Us platform to study the genetic factors for neuro-PASC and ADRD-PASC.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A large proportion of the human genome is filled with repetitive sequence, including tandem repeats which are short stretches of DNA that are repeated several times in a row.

Moreover, the risk of AD is greater in individuals with African ancestry is greater than in individuals of European ancestry.

Treatments for breast and other cancers are often associated with short term cognitive losses. In the long term, however, individuals diagnosed with cancer are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). The reverse is also true; individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer. An improved understanding of how the patterns of inverse comorbidity between the two conditions develop and why the patterns exist will give women diagnosed with cancer accurate information about likely cognitive outcomes and reveal mechanisms
(e.g., related to the immune system) that will allow for the reduction of AD/ADRD risk.
It is especially important that the relationship between cancer and AD/ADRD be disentangled in populations that are diverse across a number of dimensions.
We thus propose to evaluate the patterns of cancer and AD/ADRD diagnosis in All of Us, as well as two large population based cohorts.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with a huge burden on the society and healthcare system. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States with no effective treatment. Early-onset AD is caused by fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. Late onset AD is caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors with APOE as the strongest genetic risk factor. However, a significant proportion of the elderly remains cognitively intact despite the presence of amyloid-b, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation. We aim to apply our expertise in genetics, artificial intelligence and molecular cell biology to identify risk and protective genetic variants and their combinations to better evaluate and predict risk, resilience and age-of-onset in Alzheimer's disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We will define and use a cohort of AD cases and controls to identify associations with genetic variants. We will use tools optimized for large-scale analyses, such as PLINK, regenie and FBAT. In particular, we will use family-based approaches to analyze a subset of related individuals. We will perform both: single variant and region-based (for WES and WGS) analyses.  Regions will be selected based on variant impact and/or consecutive windows. Furthermore, we will perform stratification by specific variables of interest, such as ethnicity, sex and APOE, and calculate effect estimates in those groups. We will combine these results with other WGS AD and centenarian datasets in a meta-analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to identify new AD risk and/or protective loci with associated rare and low-frequency variants and stratified genetic associations, such as sex- or APOE- specific AD loci. Such loci associated with AD risk and/or cognitive resilience will be then tested using 3D brain models to characterize functional mechanisms. These results are of potential great value and can lead to effective early intervention of AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Once we have these individuals picked I will separate each cohort into two, one that doesn't take age into consideration, and the other that only looks at individuals with the previous criteria who are either 65 years of age or older. When looking at these two cohorts of individuals I will look at the SNP rs10164112 and analyze the Thymine and Cytosine frequencies in this sequence. Once I identify these groups of individuals I will search for the presence of APOe2, APOe3, and APOe4 in those with and without Alzheimer's Disease to see if this gene is related to AD risk as stated in previous studies.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate finding that the Thymine levels in the rs 10164112 SNP are higher in people who don't have any MCIs, and in contrast, I anticipate finding increased Cytosine levels in the rs 10164112 SNP in people who do have Alzheimer's Disease. These findings would create further evidence that the StarD6 protein is linked to AD progression and would give me and other scientists a new target area of focus when researching this disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our scientific question is, ""How does a lack of sleep quality and duration play a role in the onset and severity of Alzheimer's disease and what can be done to reduce the effects?
This question is important as it allows us to determine the factors that play a role in the disease itself.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We plan to study the emphasis that sleep factors have on Alzheimer's disease. In datasets, we hope to find possible experiments or research that was conducted to helps determine if sleep was a later result for Alzheimer's disease. Possible graphs and tables that give us numerical outcomes in a group of people will help us determine the answer to our scientific question.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from the study will likely show that lack of sleep does play a role in Alzheimer's disease. While it may not be the biggest factor to the disease curation over time, it is significant contributor.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a decline of mental function. It falls between the expected decline of normal aging, and the more serious decline of dementia. It increases a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.
The goal of our analysis is aiming to develop a risk scoring system for the prediction of the conversion of cognitively normal people into patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to provide a reliable tool for the prevention of MCI.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We may use statistical models including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, correlation analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, etc. to develop a scoring system to determine the risk of a person to have MCI.","Anticipated Findings
We will investigate risk factors associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) like gender, race, diabetes, etc., and develop risk score to that allows physician to determine the risk of developing MCI in populations 45+. Our anticipated findings can help in the early detection of MCI. Patients with suspected MCI should undergo a comprehensive history and physical examination at an earlier age to distinguish MCI from normal aging or dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Females are two-thirds as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease compared to males. Also, females also tend to have earlier onset and more severe symptoms. Whether that prevalence results from increased longevity or genetic differences remains to be understood. We want to perform association analysis for Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in a diverse population to explore genetic architecture using All of Us research dataset, with a particular focus on the previously-overlooked sex-specific effects. We seek to understand the reason behind these sex biases in Alzheimer's disease to improve health care and resolve health disparities.
We will consider the following questions:
1) Which variants are associated with Alzheimer’s disease?
2) Which variants have different effects on Alzheimer’s disease between sexes?
3) We will narrow down the list of causal variants using state-of-the-art methods.
We will publish our results as a scientific paper, and release GWAS summary statistics","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use marginal regression models such as logistic mixed regression for a binary outcome (in REGENIE) on All of Us genetics data. Phenotypes of interest are late-onset Alzheimer’s disease & other types of Alzheimer’s disease. We plan to define our phenotype based on known ICD-9 (331.0) & ICD-10 codes (G30).
1) Phenotype definition: We will try to retrieve both genetics data & phenotype data based on our established pipelines (in Liu et al) and uniformly process the data.
2) GWAS analysis: We will perform GWAS analysis for each sub-trait of interest and combine the results to perform meta-analysis. We will adjust sex, age, and 10 principal components as covariates in association analysis.
3) Sex-stratified effects and the X-chromosome: We will investigate the role of X chromosome in AD, generate sex stratified results, & perform downstream analysis such as variant annotation, among others.
We plan to use R, Python, Plink, REGENIE, and other commonly used tools.","Anticipated Findings
For this analysis, we would expect to see novel variants/genes associated with Alzheimer's phenotypes, especially those with effects showing sex differences. We expect to find: 1) potential variants or genes associated with Alzheimer's disease. 2) genetic factors' contribution to Alzheimer's disease in a sex-specific manner. 3) more accurate genetic effect estimation when we conduct sex-stratified analysis. 4) A detailed pipeline for performing similar analyses will be available to researchers within the Researcher Workbench for All of Us to enhance reproducibility. Our developed methods will benefit future research of a similar kind.","Demographic Categories of Interest
