My research interest lies in delving into the intricate relationship between environmental metal exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) among the elderly population. I am driven by specific scientific questions that aim to uncover the potential links between exposure to environmental metals and the initiation or progression of these neurodegenerative disorders. One of the central aspects of my research involves assessing the contribution of environmental metal exposure to the risk of developing AD and ADRD in the elderly. Metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum, arsenic, copper, magnesium commonly found in the environment, have the potential to accumulate in the body over time. Understanding this association is vital for identifying preventive measures and interventions to safeguard cognitive health in aging populations.","Project Purpose(s)

1. Understanding Genetic Risk Factors: Investigating the association between the APOE gene and ADRD is crucial for understanding the genetic risk factors contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. APOE is one of the most widely studied genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
2. Clinical Implications: Identifying genetic markers associated with ADRD can have significant clinical implications. It can aid in early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized treatment approaches. Understanding the strength of the association can help in determining the relative risk conferred by specific APOE alleles.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
1. Data Collection and Datasets:Access population-based cohort studies with longitudinal data to assess the relationship between APOE genotype and the development of ADRD over time. 2. Genetic Analysis: Conduct genetic association analyses to assess the association between APOE genotype and ADRD risk. 3. Statistical Modeling.","Anticipated Findings
1. Significant Association: The study may reveal a statistically significant association between specific variants of the APOE gene (e.g., ε4 allele) and an increased risk of developing ADRD. This finding would corroborate previous research highlighting APOE as a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and potentially for other related dementias as well.
2. Allelic Effects: There may be differences in the strength of the association between different APOE alleles (e.g., ε2, ε3, ε4) and ADRD risk. For instance, individuals carrying the ε4 allele may exhibit a higher risk compared to those with ε3 or ε2 alleles, with ε2 potentially being protective against ADRD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups. We will explore to what extent there is a shared genetic basis for the cooccurrence of heart and brain disease, and whether this persists across ancestries.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will conduct ancestry specific genome-wide association studies of heart and brain traits, and apply genetic colocalization to identify genetic mutations which may be a common cause of these diseases. We will consider straightforward case control analyses, as well as analyses accounting for age of onset, and disease trajectories considering the order of events. We will not exclude individuals based on sex, race, or ancestry, and rather determine consistence across these subgroups.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify genetic loci associating with heart and brain traits, aiming to uncover potential novel biological pathways which may put people at risk of early worsening of heart and brain health. Knowledge on common biological pathways is important to better target, and potentially repurposing, existing therapeutics or life-style intervention, as well as the development of novel interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are interested in the link between sleep health and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). While polysomnography (PSG; the traditional in-lab sleep study) is generally considered the ""gold-standard"" of sleep measurement, in-lab sleep measurement can have high costs, be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and may not always reflect in-home sleep habits. The All of Us dataset provides a valuable opportunity to investigate in-home sleep measurement using wearable technology (Fitbit). This allows investigators like ourselves to examine real-world sleep health in a large, diverse cohort of individuals. By doing so, we hope to add to the current understanding of how sleep health relates to neurodegenerative diseases, and how this link may differ across populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use the Fitbit data in order to investigate sleep health/sleep habits in the cohort. We will also be using EHR data in order to examine prevalence and incidence of diseases, with a particular focus on neurodegenerative diseases. We will also be using demographic data with the goal of understanding the cohort and of identifying differences between populations in the link between sleep and neurodegeneration. We will likely be testing for associations between Fitbit-measured sleep health and neurodegenerative disease prevalence and incidence.","Anticipated Findings
A large body of research has identified a link between sleep disturbances and neurodegenerative disease. We anticipate that this link will be present in the All of Us cohort in some capacity. However, it is unclear whether this connection will differ between populations. Our findings will (1) add to the current understanding of the link between sleep health and neurodegeneration, possibly contributing to the development of novel screening and risk prediction methods, and (2) will demonstrate the power of wearable technology in revolutionizing sleep measurement and sleep research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a complex spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms ranging from short-term memory lapses to the gradual loss of bodily functions leading to eventual demise. This condition significantly diminishes the quality of life for the affected older population. The widespread adoption and continual enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S have resulted in the accumulation of extensive longitudinal EHR datasets, providing valuable resources for clinical research. Numerous risk factors associated with AD, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, are routinely documented in patients' EHRs. This study endeavors to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to facilitate the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The focus is on utilizing real-world electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities in the realm of neurodegenerative disorders.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an early stage poses a formidable challenge due to the involvement of multiple intricate mechanisms in its pathogenesis.

We seek to unravel the prediction variances across different cohorts and prediction windows while assessing the significance of distinct features within each cohort using SHAP values.","Anticipated Findings
The ultimate goal of our study is to develop prediction models that can effectively identify individuals at a heightened risk of AD before its onset. These models not only pinpoint crucial factors for early prediction and prevention but also contribute to understanding why specific risk factors hold significance. Furthermore, they play a pivotal role in guiding research directions and facilitating the recruitment of individuals in the early stages of probable AD for inclusion in clinical trials.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.
The goal of this demonstration project is to validate previous research showing potential interactions between dementia, diabetes, and hypertension, with an explicit consideration of race/ ethnicity.","Project Purpose(s)

This work has been approved, reviewed, and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy.)","Scientific Approaches
Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Advances in the ability to predict disease using genetics have been enabled by large genome wide association studies and methods that can combine multiple genetic risk factors such as polygenic risk scores (PRS). The predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores for dementia has predominantly been studied in cohorts where phenotypes have been defined by autopsy or strict clinical diagnostic criteria. In practice, healthcare providers diagnose dementia during life without reviewing strict diagnostic criteria. Healthcare provider inform patients of their diagnosis and/or enter these diagnoses in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition, many polygenic risk dementia studies have been performed in individuals of European ancestry.

Treatments for breast and other cancers are often associated with short term cognitive losses. In the long term, however, individuals diagnosed with cancer are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). The reverse is also true; individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer. An improved understanding of how the patterns of inverse comorbidity between the two conditions develop and why the patterns exist will give women diagnosed with cancer accurate information about likely cognitive outcomes and reveal mechanisms
(e.g., related to the immune system) that will allow for the reduction of AD/ADRD risk.
It is especially important that the relationship between cancer and AD/ADRD be disentangled in populations that are diverse across a number of dimensions.
We thus propose to evaluate the patterns of cancer and AD/ADRD diagnosis in All of Us, as well as two large population based cohorts.","Project Purpose(s)

The genetic etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is poorly understood. Somatic mutations in the brains with AD and other neurological disorders have been established as a potential mechanism for their pathophysiology. Somatic transposable elements (TEs) are prevalent in individual neurons in the human brain's cerebral cortex, a region long associated with AD progression. Recent work has shown a connection between AD-associated Tau protein-mediated mechanisms with TE activity and somatic mutations. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated TE's role and genomic impact in AD and related dementias in the survey of large-scale cohorts. In this proposal, we aim to employ a genome-wide scan to explore the functional impact of TE in AD and related dementias by leveraging the genomic and phenotypic data in All of Us dataset.","Project Purpose(s)

Advances in the ability to predict disease using genetics have been enabled by large genome wide association studies and methods that can combine multiple genetic risk factors such as polygenic risk scores (PRS). The predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores for dementia has predominantly been studied in cohorts where phenotypes have been defined by autopsy or strict clinical diagnostic criteria. In practice, healthcare providers diagnose dementia during life without reviewing strict diagnostic criteria. Healthcare provider inform patients of their diagnosis and/or enter these diagnoses in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition, many polygenic risk dementia studies have been performed in individuals of European ancestry. Our objective is to evaluate polygenic risk scores for dementia based on phenotypes from the EHR among different ancestry groups. Improving genetic predictive models of dementia can aid in early diagnosis and treatment of dementias.","Project Purpose(s)

Using the All of Us genetic and clinical data, we will use a case control design where cases are defined by the dementia or related phenotype and controls are adults without those phenotypes. We will compute polygenic risk scores using methods such as LDPRED2. We will also consider PRS using multiple neurodegenerative diseases, PRS different genetic ancestries, and utilizing advanced machine learning models. We will evaluate the accuracy of these PRS to predict cases. We will control and stratify results by variables including age, sex, known genetic risk factors such as APOE and MAPT haplotype, and self-reported and genetic ancestry.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to develop and test genetic models that have high accuracy to predict dementia and related phenotypes with high accuracy in European and non-European genetic ancestries. These models can be validated in different cohorts and improve the early diagnosis and treatment of dementias .","Demographic Categories of Interest

Oral Health and Dementia,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The national prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to be 11% in individuals over 65 years old and 1.5-2.0 times higher in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups including Black and Hispanic/Latinx. In real world medical care based on prior studies and our work, less than half of patients with dementia have been formally diagnosed and significantly more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Our scientific questions are:
1. Are dementias underdiagnosed in the electronic health record (EHR) compared to population estimates?
2. What are the risk factors for patients to not be formally diagnosed with dementias?
3. How do the underdiagnosis and risk factors differ across racial and ethnic groups?
We hypothesize dementias are underdiagnosed the EHR, more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and that risk factors include demographics, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare access.","Project Purpose(s)

We will define dementia as probable based on ICD codes and possible based on a combination of ICD codes, medication use and personal medical history. We will calculate the prevalence of dementias across racial and ethnic group compared to population estimates. We will compare risk factors of patients who have probable dementia versus possible dementia using logistic regression correcting for demographics. Risk factors tested will include drug exposures, lab measurement, demographics, health access, and other survey questions. We will compare risk factors across racial and ethnic groups.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that dementias are underdiagnosed the EHR, more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and that risk factors for underdiagnosis include demographics, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare access, which will differ across racial and ethnic groups. These findings may lead to racially and ethnically specific strategies to improve the early and appropriate diagnosis of dementias, which can initiate multi-disciplinary care and treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This proposal seeks support for developing advanced clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug-repositioning for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The proposed project directly addresses the areas of emphasis in PAR-20-156 to “develop computational methods such as artificial intelligence/machine learning to investigate new uses of FDA-approved drugs or candidate drugs from failed Phase II/Phase III clinical trials through analysis of multimodal data.” The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel clinical informatics and computational approaches for drug repositioning of AD/ADRD. Our project holds the promise of identifying novel drug repositioning signals. This project is novel for integrating evidence synthesis methods with signal detection methods using advanced multimodal modeling, and it is potentially transformative for advancing prevention and treatment for AD/ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)

Specifically, we will develop statistical methods and ontology technology to extract drug-repositioning signals from multidimensional data (e.g., pharmacy-linked genetic data and biobank data, historical trials, and EHR data). The proposed framework is novel because it integrates advanced statistical inference procedures with semantic technology for data-driven and reproducible drug repositioning for AD/ADRD. We have three aims: We have three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop signal detection methods using multi-modal data (pharmacy-linked genetic data, genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data, and BioBank data). Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate drugs via historical trials and EHR data. Aim 3: Develop novel semantic and natural language processing (NLP) methods for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction.","Anticipated Findings
The success of this project will lead to novel computational methods, KG, and software for facilitating drug repositioning for AD/ADRD based on multimodal data. If successful, the proposed method could identify novel drug repositioning signals and generate novel hypotheses for prevention and treatment intervention of treat AD/ADRD.

Neurological diseases such as Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias can have direct or indirect impacts on day-to-day psychosocial and health behaviors (e.g., activities of daily living, healthcare utilization, self care). Little is known about the impact of neurological diseases in the sexual and gender minority populations. and as sexual and gender minority populations may experience differences in social support and other impacts of structural inequities we would like to know the following:
1) Does the impact of having Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (PD/ADRD) on psychosocial behavioral health, or well-being differ between sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and cisgender, heterosexual (CGH) individuals?
1a) Are there any differences between sexuality and gender identity subpopulations?
2) Comparing SGM and CGH individuals with PD/ADRD are there differences in comorbid conditions?","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will first identify all of those individuals with valid Sexual Orientation and Gender identity concept answers in the controlled tier dataset, and then among those we will identify the sub population with PD/ADRD diagnoses, and then among that cohort of individuals we will evaluate differences among cohort members based on sex-assigned-at-birth, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
We will use univariate (measures of central tendency, frequencies/distributions) and bivariate statistics (significant differences between groups). Differences will be assessed using the appropriate within and between groups comparisons approaches based on the type of measures used e.g [M]AN[C]OVA ([multiple] analysis of [co-]variance).
If the population of affected individuals is large enough we may evaluate complex relationships among the various psychosocial health and well-being factors using partial correlations, logistic regressions, or other multivariable analyses if appropriate.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate being able to provide some specific descriptive work related to the All-of-us sample, and any group differences that exist. At this point in time the a priori hypothesis is that SGM individuals will have a poorer psychosocial health and well-being than their CGH comparators. When we finish this work we hope that this will generate information that will spark further inquiry and opportunities to conduct studies to better understand and address any disparities that are identified among SGM individuals with PD/ADRD.
Further, descriptive analyses that examine data in the aggregate as well disaggregated data (by groups) and using analyses that allow us to account for intersecting marginalized identities are important for understanding which groups are at greatest risk for poor outcomes. We we anticipate that differences to exist in both the combined and disaggregated analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest
