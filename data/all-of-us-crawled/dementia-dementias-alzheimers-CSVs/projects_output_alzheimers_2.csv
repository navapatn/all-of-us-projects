Females are two-thirds as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease compared to males. Also, females also tend to have earlier onset and more severe symptoms. Whether that prevalence results from increased longevity or genetic differences remains to be understood. We want to perform association analysis for Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in a diverse population to explore genetic architecture using All of Us research dataset, with a particular focus on the previously-overlooked sex-specific effects. We seek to understand the reason behind these sex biases in Alzheimer's disease to improve health care and resolve health disparities.
We will consider the following questions:
1) Which variants are associated with Alzheimer’s disease?
2) Which variants have different effects on Alzheimer’s disease between sexes?
3) We will narrow down the list of causal variants using state-of-the-art methods.
We will publish our results as a scientific paper, and release GWAS summary statistics","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use marginal regression models such as logistic mixed regression for a binary outcome (in REGENIE) on All of Us genetics data. Phenotypes of interest are late-onset Alzheimer’s disease & other types of Alzheimer’s disease. We plan to define our phenotype based on known ICD-9 (331.0) & ICD-10 codes (G30).
1) Phenotype definition: We will try to retrieve both genetics data & phenotype data based on our established pipelines (in Liu et al) and uniformly process the data.
2) GWAS analysis: We will perform GWAS analysis for each sub-trait of interest and combine the results to perform meta-analysis. We will adjust sex, age, and 10 principal components as covariates in association analysis.
3) Sex-stratified effects and the X-chromosome: We will investigate the role of X chromosome in AD, generate sex stratified results, & perform downstream analysis such as variant annotation, among others.
We plan to use R, Python, Plink, REGENIE, and other commonly used tools.","Anticipated Findings
For this analysis, we would expect to see novel variants/genes associated with Alzheimer's phenotypes, especially those with effects showing sex differences. We expect to find: 1) potential variants or genes associated with Alzheimer's disease. 2) genetic factors' contribution to Alzheimer's disease in a sex-specific manner. 3) more accurate genetic effect estimation when we conduct sex-stratified analysis. 4) A detailed pipeline for performing similar analyses will be available to researchers within the Researcher Workbench for All of Us to enhance reproducibility. Our developed methods will benefit future research of a similar kind.","Demographic Categories of Interest

An antemortem diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) requires costly techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) or invasive methods like measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Other types of dementia like Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) currently have no identified biomarkers comparable to the PET and CSF measures in AD.
Wearable devices have the potential to serve as inexpensive and non-invasive ways to predict dementia type.  Passive collection is also well-suited for elderly individuals, as it avoids relying on subjective recollection and does not interfere with their day-to-day activities.
We will evaluate the ability of machine learning models using wearable devices to predict the type of dementia. We are already conducting longitudinal study on patients with mild cognitive impairment and will use the All of Us cohort to develop and test our predictions algorithms to apply them to our longitudinal cohort.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will define a cohort based on diagnosis codes and age range (higher than 55). We will then develop a pipeline to generate predictive computational models. Our pipeline includes:
1. Use developed tools to calibrate raw accelerometer data from these sources.
2. Map the raw data to derived traits of physical activity and sleep, matching the fitness tracker data measured on the prospective cohort.
3. Account for differences between the prospective study fitness trackers’ digital features and the accelerometer-derived features by having controls wear the two devices concomitantly and generating mapping functions to account for device differences.
4. Generate machine learning models on large datasets and use a transfer-learning methodology to transfer the learned models to the prospective cohort. These machine learning models will be stratified based on sex and comorbidities (e.g., heart problems).","Anticipated Findings
Our primary outcome is to generate a computational model that will accurately classify types of dementia based on wearable devices. These models will be applied to our prospective cohort to enable early detection of dementia type and prediction of risk for cognitive decline as early as the stage of mild cognitive impairment or even earlier.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)

We will analyze data from the All of Us Research Program database regarding alcohol consumption behaviors, ALDH2 genotype (rs671), demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. All participants with informative data for rs671 will be included in the study. These data sets will be from surveys, physical measurements, and the genomic data set. Statistical analyses will be done using R or python. We will examine relationships between these factors and alcohol consumption using Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables), overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors, for example, demographics.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mosaicism of chromosomes is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. While this age-related phenomenon has been known for many years, awareness of the potential role of mosaicism in human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancers, and cardiovascular disease, is a more recent development. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mosaicism in hematopoietic cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Based on prior studies, cardiac (atrial) inflammation, and fibrosis can result in disruption of normal atrial conduction and is a powerful predictor of risk for the development and progression of atrial fibrillation. In the current study, we aim to better understand the association of mosaicism with the development and progression of AF.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (atrial fibrillation)","Scientific Approaches
We will identify adult subjects with AF in the All of Us Controlled Tier dataset who have undergone genotyping, whole genome sequencing, or whole exome sequencing. We will perform basic statistical testing to examine demographics associated with the presence or absence of mosaicism. Based on these demographics, we will use multivariable regression statistical analyses to assess risk predictors for atrial fibrillation's development and progression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate mosaicism's prevalence in individuals may predict the development and progression of AF. Exploring the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AF incidence and progression may reveal new targets for preventing and treating AF. The findings may have significant implications for clinical practice and inform future research directions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

There is ample evidence to suggest that some link may exist between chronic inflammation of the brain and development of Alzheimer's disease later in life.

We will first select a cohort with high-throughput Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) data; then, we will exclude individuals with AD diagnosis and any other type of dementia using ICD-codes (total: 29 codes) and four medications (Galantamine, Rivastigmine, Memantine, and Donepezil). Individuals included in the study cohort will be from both sexes, any ethnicity, and at least 60 years old. The first group will be selected based on the APO E4/E4 genotype, which increases the risk by approximately eight to twelvefold. The second group will be selected among the individuals with a higher AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) computed from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). All the group samples will be stratified by ethnicity due to the different genetic risks of APOE and AD-associated SNPs used for the PRS.","Anticipated Findings

The non-genetic protective factors will be used to increase the knowledge of modifiable risk factors and focus on improving lifestyle conditions aiming to reduce AD risk.

The genetic etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is poorly understood. Somatic mutations in the brains with AD and other neurological disorders have been established as a potential mechanism for their pathophysiology. Somatic transposable elements (TEs) are prevalent in individual neurons in the human brain's cerebral cortex, a region long associated with AD progression. Recent work has shown a connection between AD-associated Tau protein-mediated mechanisms with TE activity and somatic mutations. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated TE's role and genomic impact in AD and related dementias in the survey of large-scale cohorts. In this proposal, we aim to employ a genome-wide scan to explore the functional impact of TE in AD and related dementias by leveraging the genomic and phenotypic data in All of Us dataset.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Genetic research has greatly increased our knowledge for the genetic basis of this disease, however despite this, we have made little headway in the discovery of disease modifying or preventative therapeutics. Additionally, genetic research for AD, as well as other diseases, is dominated by those of European ancestry. To address these issues, we are focussing on 2 scientific questions.
1. Are there genetic modifiers that affect risk for developing AD in carriers of the APOE e4 genotype? Having just one copy of the APOE e4 genotype greatly increases the risk for developing AD, however, many people possess two copies of the APOE e4 genotype and never develop AD.
2. What variants affect AD risk for non-European populations? Leveraging different LD patterns, we can increase the power to detect additional risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)

Our plan to address these 2 questions is through a series of meta-analyses and follow-up work. The plan for question 1 is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study of AD in APOE e4 carriers only. We will use the AllofUs genetic datasets as well as the demographics age, sex, and AD disease status. We will use Plink software to carry out this analysis. We will then meta-analyze these results with summary statistics from other AD cohorts. Follow-up will include FUMA and gene burden tests to further investigate any potential findings. The plan for question 2 is to perform a Trans-Ancestry Meta Analysis to nominate new risk variants. We will use Plink to perform GWAS is populations that have been defined by genetic ancestry, and then will use MR-MEGA software to meta-analyze the summary statistics in order to nominate new risk variants that may have different effects on disease risk in different ancestry populations.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are two-fold: the first is to nominate genetic variants that effect AD risk in APOE e4 carriers. This is one of many important steps on the journey to precision medicine. It is unlikely that we will find a therapeutic that works for all types of AD and dementia. Instead, we must focus on specific types of disease. By discovering additional genetic modifiers of risk (why do some APOE e4 carriers not get AD?) we can potentially nominate new targets that have a better chance at disease modification. Second, we need to make an active effort as a research community to include non-European populations in genetic research. Much less is known about the genetic basis of AD in non-European populations. We aim to nominate new AD risk variants that are present in multiple and different populations so that we can increase our knowledge and treatment of those populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will develop models to predict the risk for neurological complications. In particular, we will use the numeric output that before the softmax in the final binary output as the risk of the predicted neuro-PASC or ADRD-PASC. In addition, we will also consider the predicted hazards, the output from the survival outcome predictions. Also, to maximize the information captured by our deep learning models, we will also use the neurons in the hidden layer as endophenotypes for neuro-PASC and ADRD-PASC. For all phenotypes, we will conduct single-phenotype GWAS association tests using linear mixed models.
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia are already an important national priority and Neurological complications of PASC (neuro-PASC) are important as they are a major category of PASC. Finding the related genetic factors behind these two disease can be crucial in the management of  early detection.","Project Purpose(s)

across the United States. All of Us is a unique source where we can access the genetic and clinical data for 100000 US patients and with higher representation for
minority groups.
Research Methods and Methods : We train a deep learning-based model on COVID-19 patients’ data available through the N3C initiative. As an outcome, the model will learn a phenotypic representation that consists of the patient's risk to develop post COVID complications, including neuropsychiatric complications Afterwards, we will transfer the model to the All of Us researcher platform and apply our model to create the phenotypic  representation for the 11,767 COVID-19 patients using their EHR data.

The heritability of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is estimated between 60-80%, indicating a strong genetic component to susceptibility to AD; which differs between ancestral populations. Although genetic ancestry has been shown to modify an individual’s risk for AD, the majority of genome-wide association studies and models for the calculation of a polygenic risk score have utilized data derived from populations with mostly European ancestry. Furthermore, a well-defined model of an ancestry-informed PRS has yet to be established in admixed populations. We aim to utilize All of Us Research Program data along with data from other studies such as the NIH AD sequencing project to build improved models of AD risk in admixed populations. We hypothesize that an ancestry-informed model for polygenic risk will provide a more accurate representation of AD risk in individuals with admixed genetic ancestry, compared to models that have been built off homogenous ancestral populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Alongside data from other studies, we will use genetic data from the All of Us Research program to evaluate the local ancestry of known genetic risk factors of AD to determine whether risk models in admixed populations improve with the addition of ancestry information. This will be done by mapping local ancestry of known genetic risk factors of AD as well as global (genomic average) proportions of genetic ancestry across the genomes of the participants. We will then leverage AD diagnosis against the composition of local ancestry proportions. These data will be used to build the framework of an ancestry-informed PRS model. We will then employ a meta-analysis framework that has utility in both multiethnic and ethnic-specific analysis utilizing fixed or random effects models and assess phenotypic heterogeneity through Cochran's Q test when comparing prediction accuracy within and across self-identified racial or ethnic categories.","Anticipated Findings
We expect ancestry specific genetic modifiers of AD risk between populations, with risk further modified by proportions of local ancestry spread across the genomes of admixed individuals. Furthermore, we predict that the local ancestry of known genetic modifiers of AD risk differentially influences AD risk when considering global proportions of genetic ancestry as well as non-genetic risk factors of AD such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and social determinants of health. We also predict these data can be leveraged to build an ancestry specific polygenic risk model. We will publish these findings and share the weights used to develop the score (which can be performed in a privacy-preserving fashion) to ensure other parties can leverage our insights and improve biomedical research across AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

By using the data, I hope to find answers on Alzheimer's disease progression in American Indian communities, specifically in the women ages 65 years or older. This research will be looking into the  Apolipoprotein variants E2, E3, and E4 within the American Indian populations and comparing the information to other ethnic groups. This research will investigate specific tribes within the United States by certain demographic areas. Many tribal elders use natural botanical plants from their environments for treatment of illnesses and diseases. I will explore the data to see what types of plants from the various areas have been researched or studied.","Project Purpose(s)

The goal of this research will be to create a holistic model that shows the fitness impact of a grandmother getting Alzheimer's disease.  Cultural factors such as high grandparent care and multigenerational households in Latino/a communities must be taken into account in the model. Evolutionary factors will be essential to the model in order to incorporate the grandmother effect and how grandmother’s generally increase fitness by caring for their offspring and allowing their daughters to have more children, indirectly increasing their own fitness. Genetic factors will be applied with the understanding of APOE and how an APOE4 homozygous individual will have a high chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease, allelic information could allow us to predict Alzheimer’s outcomes.","Anticipated Findings

The goal of this project is to uncover novel early biomarkers and generate prediction models for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on race/ethnicity or dietary habits. The hypothesis is that metabolic dysfunction and diet-associated health issues are predictors for cognitive impairment in a race/ethnicity-specific manner. We propose using medical data obtained from 6 University of California Medical Centers to generate prediction models for AD development based on metabolic disease diagnoses and clinical test results, differentiating by race and ethnicity as well as gender. The long-term objective is to aggressively treat and prevent metabolic diseases prevalent among differing ethnicities, leading to AD prevention.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease and Liver diseases)","Scientific Approaches
The inclusion criteria are patients who are 65-95 years old with and without AD based on ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases).
Diseases that affect liver functions (alcoholic, toxic, failure, chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, inflammation, malignancy, i.e., liver cancer of any types, autoimmune, Wilson’s Disease), Type 2 diabetes melilotus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, as well as nicotine or alcohol dependence will be included for risk predictions. Demographic data and clinical tests that will be included are birth sex, BMI, age at menopause (or hot flash symptom, hemoglobin A1C, glucose blood/urine tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, plasma viscosity, liver function panels, comprehensive metabolic panels, blood count, lipid panels, urinalysis, C reactive protein, and prothrombin time to generate prediction models. All of those are possible indicators of metabolic dysfunction.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to generate good prediction models and to be able to quantify the importance of metabolic clinical features for AD identification. If the learned model is not sufficiently accurate on held-back data, we will retrain the models from scratch using more domain knowledge to reduce the complexity of the prediction tasks. We will also explore the possibility of using a similar dataset to pre-train a model or to select appropriate features. If the data does not match with the known National data, we will look into patient population and barriers to access within the UC system. The benchmarks for success are measured by: (1) the identification of disparities in AD as well as metabolic diseases in the UC system; (2) the generation of good models for predicting AD based on race and ethnicity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will also check how the UK Biobank results (which we already have) compare to the ones with All of Us. In addition, we will apply methods described in the MIST software and compare with standard statistical methods using the AD datasets in All of Us.

The national prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to be 11% in individuals over 65 years old and 1.5-2.0 times higher in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups including Black and Hispanic/Latinx. In real world medical care based on prior studies and our work, less than half of patients with dementia have been formally diagnosed and significantly more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Our scientific questions are:
1. Are dementias underdiagnosed in the electronic health record (EHR) compared to population estimates?
2. What are the risk factors for patients to not be formally diagnosed with dementias?
3. How do the underdiagnosis and risk factors differ across racial and ethnic groups?
We hypothesize dementias are underdiagnosed the EHR, more so in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and that risk factors include demographics, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare access.","Project Purpose(s)

Itch is a common clinical phenomenon which worsens with age, and up to one-third of elderly patients report clinically significant itch with moderate impact on their quality of life. Itch and neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease are also significantly associated in aging humans. For example, bullous pemphigoid – a pruritic autoimmune skin disorder whose incidence rises with age – increases the odds of dementia by 10-fold (95% confidence interval 5.4-17.8]). The association between age-related non-neoplastic skin conditions and neurological disorders can be due to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, exposure) or upstream pathophysiology (systemic inflammation, inflammaging), but studies dissecting these potential mechanistic relationships are lacking. In this study, I intend to evaluate the association between dementia and pruritus in an aging population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)","Scientific Approaches
I will use descriptive statistics to characterize pruritic skin diseases in patients with and without dementia including demographic information, inflammatory skin diseases, dementia subtypes, other comorbid medical conditions, and use of specific medications that have been associated with the development of dementia in prior literature (e.g. sedating anti-histamines). I will use basic statistical techniques to assess these relationships including chi-squared analyses, t-tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear multivariable linear regression models.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that these analyses will demonstrate an association between dementia and pruritus, measured by presence/absence of pruritic inflammatory skin diseases.

Clinical trials are often criticized for poor population representativeness and generalizability. There is a gap between the need to broaden clinical trial criteria and ways available to fulfill the need in practice. We will systematically analyze existing Alzheimer's disease trials in ClinicalTrials.gov to create a standardized library of computable eligibility criteria (CEC) and develop statistical models on how adjustments to eligibility criteria, especially age and aging-related comorbidities, would affect (1) trial generalizability, and (2) outcomes (i.e., SAEs) of the target population, approximated using real-world data (RWD).","Project Purpose(s)

Building on our prior CEC work, we will systematically analyze AD trials to standardize their eligibility criteria into CEC (i.e., standardized query templates that translate each AD trial criterion pattern into database queries) based on the OMOP common data model (CDM).  We will identify data gaps (e.g., Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE]) in the structured CDM and identify strategies to extract these data elements (e.g., from clinical notes). First, we will first conduct a systematic review of SAE prediction models that use RWD, especially EHRs.  Second, informed by the systematic review and built upon our prior work, we will use the RWD from All of Us to analyze and model the mathematical relationships among criteria (i.e., study traits), generalizability, and outcomes (i.e., SAEs) to understand how adjustments to eligibility criteria will jointly affect AD trials’ generalizability and real-world target AD patients’ outcomes.","Anticipated Findings

Neurological diseases such as Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias can have direct or indirect impacts on day-to-day psychosocial and health behaviors (e.g., activities of daily living, healthcare utilization, self care). Little is known about the impact of neurological diseases in the sexual and gender minority populations. and as sexual and gender minority populations may experience differences in social support and other impacts of structural inequities we would like to know the following:
1) Does the impact of having Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (PD/ADRD) on psychosocial behavioral health, or well-being differ between sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and cisgender, heterosexual (CGH) individuals?
1a) Are there any differences between sexuality and gender identity subpopulations?
2) Comparing SGM and CGH individuals with PD/ADRD are there differences in comorbid conditions?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will first identify all of those individuals with valid Sexual Orientation and Gender identity concept answers in the controlled tier dataset, and then among those we will identify the sub population with PD/ADRD diagnoses, and then among that cohort of individuals we will evaluate differences among cohort members based on sex-assigned-at-birth, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
We will use univariate (measures of central tendency, frequencies/distributions) and bivariate statistics (significant differences between groups). Differences will be assessed using the appropriate within and between groups comparisons approaches based on the type of measures used e.g [M]AN[C]OVA ([multiple] analysis of [co-]variance).
If the population of affected individuals is large enough we may evaluate complex relationships among the various psychosocial health and well-being factors using partial correlations, logistic regressions, or other multivariable analyses if appropriate.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate being able to provide some specific descriptive work related to the All-of-us sample, and any group differences that exist. At this point in time the a priori hypothesis is that SGM individuals will have a poorer psychosocial health and well-being than their CGH comparators. When we finish this work we hope that this will generate information that will spark further inquiry and opportunities to conduct studies to better understand and address any disparities that are identified among SGM individuals with PD/ADRD.
Further, descriptive analyses that examine data in the aggregate as well disaggregated data (by groups) and using analyses that allow us to account for intersecting marginalized identities are important for understanding which groups are at greatest risk for poor outcomes. We we anticipate that differences to exist in both the combined and disaggregated analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will analyze the potential different mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease, using parameters including medicines from EHR records, genetic backgrounds, questionnaires, blood test lab parameters, etc.
Specific questions we will ask are:
1. How the points of AD patients are presented in the high-dimension space? Are there any cluster structures? Is it possible to reduce the dimensions?
2. What are the high dimension structures of the age/sex mapping controls related to AD patients?
3. If we identified some clusters in point1, what’s the potential contributions of aging to different clusters. Is it possible to predict AD risks for certain clusters for the younger population?
They are hundreds of potential factors that are associated with AD. We hypothesis that some of those factors shared the same pathological pathways, and thus would cluster in the high dimension space. We expected to conclude some relative independent major driven factors for AD.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
We will apply algorithms developed at Columbia University and in the OHDSI network to All of Us data to find medication sequences. We will use Python and BigQuery to (1) retrieve AD patients and the HER, questionnaires and Genomic information. (2) Filter the data with AD risk factors and visualize their structures in high dimensional space. (3) Clustering the data using various clustering and dimensional reduction methods to check potential clusters; (4) Analyzing contribution factors to each potential clusters. (5) Analyzing the structure of cognitive normal subjects with similar AD risk factors. We will engage community partners to review our hypotheses, approach, and study limitations. Limitations include: 1. medication reports may not tell us how well people adhered to their prescribed therapy; 2. High heterogeneity and relative small sample size in the data might result in biased clusters.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show several distinct clusters in AD patients, which may due to different pathological mechanisms in AD which require different therapeutic strategies. We expect to find (1) subtypes of AD; (2) potential contribution factors to different subtypes; (3) effect size of different risk factors to different subtypes; (4)potential predictive model to AD; (5) and potential therapeutic strategies to different AD sub types. Importantly, the detailed code developed will be made available within the Researcher Workbench, so other researchers may more easily repeat our study or applie similar research strategies to other diseases. We believe this approach will be useful in many discovery studies.","Demographic Categories of Interest
