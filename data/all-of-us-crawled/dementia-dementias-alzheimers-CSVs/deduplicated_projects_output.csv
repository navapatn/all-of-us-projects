My research interest lies in delving into the intricate relationship between environmental metal exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) among the elderly population. I am driven by specific scientific questions that aim to uncover the potential links between exposure to environmental metals and the initiation or progression of these neurodegenerative disorders. One of the central aspects of my research involves assessing the contribution of environmental metal exposure to the risk of developing AD and ADRD in the elderly. Metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum, arsenic, copper, magnesium commonly found in the environment, have the potential to accumulate in the body over time. Understanding this association is vital for identifying preventive measures and interventions to safeguard cognitive health in aging populations.","Project Purpose(s)

I plan to employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating epidemiological analysis of existing datasets on metal exposure and cognitive outcomes in the elderly. Utilizing statistical methods, I aim to identify associations and potential biomarkers indicative of neurotoxicity. Advanced imaging tools may aid in elucidating mechanisms. Overall, this research will leverage diverse datasets, statistical analyses, and cutting-edge tools to comprehensively address the intricate relationship between environmental metal exposure and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings from this study may unveil significant associations between environmental metal exposure and AD/ADRD, shedding light on specific metals' roles and potential biomarkers for neurotoxicity. Such findings would significantly contribute to the scientific knowledge in the field by providing a nuanced understanding of the environmental contributors to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in the elderly. Additionally, unveiling gene-environment interactions offers a personalized approach to assessing susceptibility. These contributions not only advance our theoretical understanding of the complex interplay between environmental factors and neurodegenerative diseases but also hold practical implications for developing evidence-based public health policies aimed at reducing metal exposure and safeguarding cognitive health in aging populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

60-80% of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) risk is heritable.  Both genetic and environmental factors are responsible for the development and progression of LOAD. Many LOAD susceptibility genes have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While genetic factors contribute significantly to the risk of developing LOAD, the impact of environmental factors on the disease remains multifaceted. We propose a research proposal that assesses gene-environment (G×E) interactions in LOAD to analyze All of Us data. We will test these hypotheses: 1) individuals with the same or lower genetic risks will face an increased risk for LOAD when modified by higher environmental risks (vulnerability), whereas those with the same or higher genetic risks will experience a reduced risk when influenced by lower environmental risks (resilience); 2) effects of genetic risks on LOAD will vary modified by midlife and later-life environmental risks across ethnoracial groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are well-established in LOAD studies and feature an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to LOAD by aggregating genetic effects of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), thus serving as a comprehensive score for genetic risks. We will examine the interactions between PRSs and each of environmental risk factors in LOAD. We will also use an item response theory (IRT)-based model to generate environmental risk scores (ERSs) and investigate the interactions between PRSs and midlife/later-life ERSs in LOAD across ethnoracial groups. We will utilize the All of Us genetic data and published GWAS summary statistics to construct LOAD PRSs and construct midlife and later-life ERSs based on various environmental indicators in the All of Us data, including social of determinants of health (e.g., education and incomes), physical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and depression), and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol, and exercise) variables.","Anticipated Findings
Overall, we will examine one-by-one G×E interactions in LOAD, but also construct comprehensive scores, PRSs and midlife/later-life ERSs, for individuals across ethnoracial groups, collectively contributing to advancing our knowledge of G×E interactions on vulnerability and resilience to LOAD. Informed by data indicating an overall risk (PRS modified by ERS) for LOAD, this approach may enable clinicians and individuals to initiate disease screening and discuss life planning strategies. This study would also provide a crucial tool for informing the design and implementation of personalized therapeutic and preventative programs, enabling more precise and individualized approaches to the treatment and prevention of LOAD. This study not only enhances our understanding of progression of LOAD but also provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to mitigate risk and bolster resilience, thereby advancing personalized interventions for diverse populations at different life stages.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I intend to study how polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease correlate with various wearable data, such as sleep patterns and heart rate among healthy individuals. This research is necessary because it aims to shed light on the potential early indicators or risk factors for Alzheimer's disease before symptoms appear. By understanding how genetic predisposition interacts with lifestyle factors, we can potentially identify interventions or preventive measures to delay or mitigate the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
I am exploring the data to formalize a specific research question at this stage because I believe wearable data can provide valuable insights into the early stages of Alzheimer's disease development. The scientific question I hope to answer using the data is whether individuals with a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's disease exhibit distinct sleep and heart rate patterns compared to those with a lower risk score.","Project Purpose(s)

I will select a cohort of healthy individuals with available SNP genotype or whole-genome sequence data and additional datasets such as Fitbit data,  social determinants of health, and/or Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
I will adapt previously published Polygenic Risk Scores (PGSs)  to compute individual PGS for Alzheimer's disease by utilizing genetic data.
I will gather wearable (Fitbit) data, including but not limited to sleep patterns and heart rate. This data will provide insights into participants' daily activities and physiological parameters.
I will examine the relationship between PGS for Alzheimer's disease and wearable data. This may involve correlation analysis and regression modeling to identify patterns and associations within the data.
I will integrate EHR data into the analysis to supplement the wearable data and provide additional context and clinical information.","Anticipated Findings
1. The study may reveal correlations between polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease and various wearable data such as sleep patterns and heart rate.
2. Certain patterns or changes in wearable data may emerge as potential early biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease risk.
3. The study findings could offer insights into the underlying mechanisms linking genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease with physiological changes captured by wearable devices.
4. By identifying potential early indicators of Alzheimer's disease risk, the study could inform the development of preventive strategies or early intervention approaches.

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
This research will utilize pooled data from multiple cohorts, in addition to stand-alone analyses in All of Us. This is because disentangling the effects of specific factors from other risk factors and biases cannot necessarily be evaluated using a single cohort without formally examining consistencies and differences in associations across cohorts (e.g., due to selection processes), as well as individuals in different birth cohorts. We will use quantitative methods including genetic analysis and instrumental variables to evaluate misclassification and quantify bias in estimated effects on ADRD-associated outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
This study will improve the validity of lifecourse research cohorts and provide more valid and public health-relevant estimates of the effects of genetic, social and potentially modifiable determinants of ADRD. The tools will be useful to other ADRD researchers. All of Us provides an incomparable source of data because of its size, the detailed characterization of the cohort, and the heterogeneity of participants compared to the other cohorts we plan to leverage.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Non-invasive and low-cost tools for early detection of individuals at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are of crucial importance. While genetic studies (GWAS) exist, most focus on European populations, limiting their application to diverse groups. Given the Eurocentric biases in GWASs, PRSs are better at predicting AD risk for European ancestry as opposed to others. This research addresses this gap by developing a multimodal hazard score (MHS) that incorporates ethnically and genetically diverse populations. Our team established a successful polygenic hazard score (PHS) that predicts AD onset in European cohorts. Higher PHS predicted greater cognitive decline in CN, entorhinal cortex volume loss and predicted conversion from cognitively normal (CN), to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.  This suggests its potential as a robust genetic risk indicator to be included in the MHS while also looking into diverse populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
Leveraging data from the different AD cohorts, we will conduct Cox proportional models to develop the MHS combining age, PHS, brain atrophy, biofluid-based data, and clinical outcomes to predict neurocognitive decline trajectory. This score will be able to predict AD progression and identify individuals at high risk of transitioning from cognitive normalcy to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventually AD in a generalizable population. Additionally, we will also compute power calculations to estimate required clinical trial sample sizes after hypothetical enrichment using the MHS. Finally, we aim to replicate these findings in other diverse cohorts to ensure broader applicability.","Anticipated Findings
We believe this MHS surpasses single-modal and European data-driven models in predicting AD for diverse populations. This could pave the way for earlier intervention, more efficient research, and ultimately, improved outcomes for individuals at risk of AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism.

The APOE4 allele is the major susceptibility gene for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at older ages.

The impact of APOE4 on risk, rate of decline, & differential effects of the first AD-modifying disease medications has begun to have a major impact on the fight against AD. Recent studies in relatively small cohorts raised the possibility that APOE4 has a smaller impact on AD risk in African American/Black & Hispanic/Latino than in non-Hispanic persons.

Data from participants with these genotypes who are initially ages 60-80, don’t have initial diagnosis of AD dementia & have 5+ years of subsequent EHR data. Survival analyses will control for potential confounds of age, sex, education & if available an indicator of SES. To test our hypothesis with improved statistical power, we will combine HM & HT into an aggregate APOE4 carrier group, compare survival from AD dementia in initial analysis & control for the potential confound of differences among ethnic/racial groups in the carrier group. Exploratory analyses characterize HM vs NC & HT vs NC in the 3 ethnic/racial groups.","Anticipated Findings

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neurodevelopment (including conditions like autism and ADHD), genetic markers of such conditions, and neurodegeneration (including dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s). We will examine the role of several intervenable targets between neurodevelopmental and neurodegeneration. These lifestyle factors are known to impact neurodegeneration in the general population, but their role in people with neurodevelopmental conditions is unknown.

We will compare rates of neurodegenerative disorders across people with genetic liability for autism, ADHD, and ID, identified via polygenic risk scores, which will be expressed as a z-score based on the mean/standard deviation. We will examine data across the life course for evidence that genetic risk for neurodevelopmental conditions is linked to neurodegeneration and we will estimate the genetic correlation between the two using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression. We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle. We will use DNA methylation data to construct epigenetic clocks to examine accelerated aging. We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings
Preliminary studies have suggested neurodegeneration may be more pronounced in people with neurodevelopmental conditions. The ultimate purpose of this research is to increase understanding of neurodegeneration risk in people with neurodevelopmental conditions, with an eye towards modifiable factors. We will also examine the genetic link between genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, which may illuminate causal pathways to neurodegeneration. Using high-resolution phenotyping available in All of Us uniquely allows the examination of early-onset degeneration. This is important, as early-onset degeneration may be a target for intervention. Other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and cardiovascular health, may also be important targets for intervention. These explorations hope to improve public health.

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The proposed method utilizes a SNP network to capture interactions between genetic variants based on linkage disequilibrium scores. The network represents the complex relationships among genetic factors. Feature propagation, a technique that refines genetic variant information based on graph neural networks (GNNs), is then employed to predict AD risk scores. Meanwhile, following the concept of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), brain imaging endophenotypes enhance prediction power and identify significant regions affecting specific diseases. Moreover, a generative artificial intelligence model is applied to produce pseudo-imaging endophenotypes for samples with only genetic information.","Anticipated Findings
The proposed method will be applied to data including (i) both genetic and brain imaging information from two datasets: UK Biobank (UKBB), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and (ii) only genetic information from the All of Us research program (AoU). The results will be cross-validated from the two datasets (UKBB and ADNI), and a generative model will be applied to AoU. The final prediction results will be compared with other models, including the polygenic risk score–continuous shrinkage (PRS-CS) model.

To address the scientific question of exploring Alzheimer's genetic data in underrepresented populations, particularly focusing on variants associated with AD in the African American population, we will employ the following methods:
Data Preprocessing and Quality Control: Perform quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the genetic data. Filter out variants with low quality scores, genotype call rates, and those that are not relevant.
Variant Calling and Analysis: Use bioinformatics tools such as GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) or SAMtools for variant calling and genotyping.

5. Is there any relation with the polygenic risk score (PRS) for EOAD within the population utilizing data obtained from an extensive Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)?
The above-mentioned questions are important due to
1. Determining the Age Range of Onset Of EOAD.
2. Calculating Ethnicity or Race Frequency: It helps to understand the disease's epidemiology across diverse populations.
3. Proportional Distribution of Pathogenic Variants.

The present research is an observational study that involves observing and recording data without manipulating variables. Here we use the epidemiological and genetic datasets of EOAD using the 'All of Us' Research Program controlled tier and spanned from Fall 23 to Spring 24. The study population is EOAD patients. For data analysis, we used statistical software such as R, Python/Jupyter Notebook with libraries like NumPy and Pandas, or specialized software like SPSS. Different types of tests will be done such as the Shapiro-Wilk test will be done to see whether the retrieved data is normally distributed or not, the Chi-squared tests (to test the epidemiological data) along with mean+/- standard deviation and the polygenic risk scores, first calculated it and then perform statistical analyses to assess the association between the PRS and the disease such as linear regression. ROC  and  AUC can be used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the PRS.","Anticipated Findings
Our study hypothesizes that early onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) exhibits a wide age range of onset due to its hereditary nature. We anticipate observing variations in the manifestation of EOAD across different races and genders. Our investigation suggests that pathogenic variants play a significant role in the development of this disease. Furthermore, we aim to explore the association between calculating polygenic risk scores and the occurrence of EOAD, seeking insights into the genetic factors contributing to its onset.
The anticipated findings would contribute significantly to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) in several ways:

All prevalent human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s or diabetes, are known to be driven by a complex combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Numerous genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of genetic variants to common diseases. By design, GWAS
only find associations with a disease but cannot reveal which genetic variants are causal within
associated regions of the genome.  Current “fine mapping” algorithms, which aim to
pinpoint the truly causal variants, fail if there are too many variants that are inherited together, which is
often the case. This project will develop a new fine mapping method that uses GWAS data to identify
combinations of genetic variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The new method is based on a mathematical approximation that makes it much faster than existing
algorithms. This speed advantage allows the method to exhaustively explore the large number of
possible combinations of variants and identify those that have a high probability of being causal. In this
project, the new method will be thoroughly benchmarked against state-of-the art methods on simulated
data, for which the ground truth is known. The method will also be extended to consider additional
information about the human genome, such as the position of genes or molecular characteristics that
control the expression of genes.","Anticipated Findings
Many novel disease-associated genetic variants that have been overlooked to date are expected to be discovered by the
new approach. The final goal of the project is to implement the method in a user-friendly software
package that can be easily adopted by the bioinformatics community.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a complex spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms ranging from short-term memory lapses to the gradual loss of bodily functions leading to eventual demise. This condition significantly diminishes the quality of life for the affected older population. The widespread adoption and continual enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S have resulted in the accumulation of extensive longitudinal EHR datasets, providing valuable resources for clinical research. Numerous risk factors associated with AD, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, are routinely documented in patients' EHRs. This study endeavors to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to facilitate the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The focus is on utilizing real-world electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities in the realm of neurodegenerative disorders.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an early stage poses a formidable challenge due to the involvement of multiple intricate mechanisms in its pathogenesis. Our research aims to delve into diverse patient cohorts with AD, utilizing extracted features and exploring feature selection through both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches. We seek to unravel the prediction variances across different cohorts and prediction windows while assessing the significance of distinct features within each cohort using SHAP values.","Anticipated Findings
The ultimate goal of our study is to develop prediction models that can effectively identify individuals at a heightened risk of AD before its onset. These models not only pinpoint crucial factors for early prediction and prevention but also contribute to understanding why specific risk factors hold significance.

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.

Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Based on previous results on the four diseases found the primary incidence rates was found within white females in mid stage of life.  Menopausal hormonal shifts were hypothesized to be linked to an increased risk of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insomnia, and sleep apnea, which each contributed to an elevated CVD occurrence.  Based on previous findings the All of Us database needed more diversity to properly evaluate the spread of risk across the various populations included in the study.  The findings will contribute the importance of developing additional diagnostic tests by increasing funding for womens health programs to assist with awareness for the affected demographics.  Moreover by increasing funding more research intervention strategies may be developed to provide education on lowering risk of CVD in postmenopausal females.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Objective: This study aims to quantify the link between antihypertensive therapies and Alzheimer's disease risk, expanding on the established relationship between primary hypertension and AD.
Introduction: Previous research has identified primary hypertension as a key risk factor for AD. Effective hypertension management may impact AD progression and cognitive decline.
Methods: Leveraging All of Us data, we'll longitudinally analyze individuals, stratifying by hypertension status. Those with primary hypertension will be categorized by antihypertensive drug class: Thiazide-type diuretics, Calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. We'll assess cognitive performance trajectories, adjusting for confounders, precision variables, and time-varying variables influenced by prior interventions. The confounders we will incorporate into our models will be derived by searching a biomedical knowledge graph derived from both the literature and biomedical ontologies.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Genetic research has greatly increased our knowledge for the genetic basis of this disease, however despite this, we have made little headway in the discovery of disease modifying or preventative therapeutics. Additionally, genetic research for AD, as well as other diseases, is dominated by those of European ancestry. To address these issues, we are focussing on 2 scientific questions.
1. Are there genetic modifiers that affect risk for developing AD in carriers of the APOE e4 genotype? Having just one copy of the APOE e4 genotype greatly increases the risk for developing AD, however, many people possess two copies of the APOE e4 genotype and never develop AD.
2. What variants affect AD risk for non-European populations? Leveraging different LD patterns, we can increase the power to detect additional risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia)","Scientific Approaches
Our plan to address these 2 questions is through a series of meta-analyses and follow-up work. The plan for question 1 is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study of AD in APOE e4 carriers only. We will use the AllofUs genetic datasets as well as the demographics age, sex, and AD disease status. We will use Plink software to carry out this analysis. We will then meta-analyze these results with summary statistics from other AD cohorts. Follow-up will include FUMA and gene burden tests to further investigate any potential findings. The plan for question 2 is to perform a Trans-Ancestry Meta Analysis to nominate new risk variants. We will use Plink to perform GWAS is populations that have been defined by genetic ancestry, and then will use MR-MEGA software to meta-analyze the summary statistics in order to nominate new risk variants that may have different effects on disease risk in different ancestry populations.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are two-fold: the first is to nominate genetic variants that effect AD risk in APOE e4 carriers. This is one of many important steps on the journey to precision medicine. It is unlikely that we will find a therapeutic that works for all types of AD and dementia. Instead, we must focus on specific types of disease. By discovering additional genetic modifiers of risk (why do some APOE e4 carriers not get AD?) we can potentially nominate new targets that have a better chance at disease modification. Second, we need to make an active effort as a research community to include non-European populations in genetic research. Much less is known about the genetic basis of AD in non-European populations. We aim to nominate new AD risk variants that are present in multiple and different populations so that we can increase our knowledge and treatment of those populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How effective is treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD) using donepezil, memantine, or both in combination based on the AllofUs dataset? Additionally, how often each of these different treatments administered to the general patient population in terms of sex at birth?
Through answering these questions, more data will be contributed to the existing literature on the effectiveness of these three therapies on a more diverse patient population. Additionally, the relationship between sex at birth and treatment administered to effectively treat the symptoms of AD will be analyzed. This will help determine if there is biased treatment administration based on sex at birth, and could help determine whether a treatment path seems to treat symptoms better depending on sex at birth.","Project Purpose(s)

Using an umbrella study design, I will look at the three different drug treatment options and attempt to determine a connection between the symptoms described by participants and their treatment course as well as how this relates to their sex at birth.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate finding that combination therapy is the most effecting treatment for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (based on the literature) and that this therapy is most effective in patients born female at birth. This is the expected outcome because of the literature recently researched, and because Alzheimer's disease occurs more often in females. Researching these questions in the AllofUs, data set will be contributed to the scientific knowledge by showing how these therapies impact a more diverse cohort of patients while also looking into the impact of sex at birth on Alzheimer's disease progression when using 3 different treatment pathways.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am interested in looking at any positive correlation between a history of blood transfusion + later development of Alzheimer's disease; I am working w/ the UKB database to compare data results for validation purposes and potential to correlate to imaging findings. The goal is to identify if there is a potential risk of blood-borne transmission of amyloid-like pathologies, like Alzheimer's. This is a question I developed following a recent JAMA article looking at the correlation between the risk of spontaneous ICHin blood transfusion recipients who received blood from later identified CAA+ patients (something that would not have been known at the time of donation). There is an increased risk of ICH and possible transmission of CAA via blood - given this relationship its possible amyloid-like pathology follows a similar pattern of previously unidentified transmission, especially given that patients who donate may not realize that they later on will develop Alzheimers.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)
Population Health
Control Set","Scientific Approaches
Datasets will include patients with a history of transfusion w/ and w/o the development of Alzheimer's, and patients with Alzheimer's w/ and w/o a history of both blood donation or transfusion recipients. Then we will analyze for any statistically significant correlation. If correlation is demonstrated we plan to validate against the UKB dataset, if validated we will correlate findings with imaging and polygenic risk stratification data. The big question is more - is there a correlation, if not then we may not move forward with further analysis as it likely wouldn't be indicated.","Anticipated Findings
My hypothesis is that there may be some positive correlation. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is not an identified (as of yet) transmissible element in blood transfusions for amyloid-B pathology, however, those studies have specifically looked for an identifiable element within patients' blood, e.g. some kind of biomarker of Alzhimer's that may indicate a patient's propensity for later development (like measuring high blood pressure as a correlate for increased cardiovascular disease risk). What has not been looked at is the rate or potential relationship between blood donation in presumably healthy patients who later develop Alzheimer's and the risk that their transfused recipients later develop Alzheimer's - this is largely because these diseases are slow progressing, and identification of amyloid-like neuropathology is usually post-mortem or after severe cognitive decline, meaning honestly the data to correlate is emerging.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will integrate genetic data with the electronic health records to analyze the underlying disease pathways. Specifically, we propose to investigate the time-varying effect genetic effect. The specific questions we will ask are:

2.	Can we develop a framework to monitoring the potential sign of the late onset Alzheimer’s diseases before it is diagnosed?
3.	Integrated with other lab measurements and brain image resources, can we utilize deep learning to develop a unified system for the detection and prediction of Alzheimer’s diseases?

We will develop innovative statistical methods based on quantile regressions construct a reference system to monitoring the development of Alzheimer’s diseases. An intuitive idea would be growth chart to monitor the height and weight of a child and give the percentile of him/her in the cohort. By integrating genetic data with electronic health records, such as brain images and recognition tests, we will be able to build a more comprehensive system to describe the patient’s disease progression given the cohort as a reference. This will also help prevent or warn the appearance of the Alzheimer’s at an early stage. Technically speaking, we will use low-rank approximation, data integration, and quantile regression to achieve this goal. We will develop statistical estimation and inference tools to quantify the uncertainty, and illustrate the methods by applications in All of Us data.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to have contributions in statistical methodology and genetics. From a statistical perspective, integrating multi-source data is always a challenging task, due to the errors in the observed data and the heterogeneity caused by unmeasured confounders. We will use quantile regression, a robust way of modeling, to reduce the effect from data heterogeneity, and low-rank approximation, to extract the main feature from different types of the data (e.g., brain images, lab measurements). From a genetic perspective, it is novel and in need to investigating time-varying genetic effect, especially for aging-related diseases. Due to the increasing amount of patients suffered from Alzheimer’s diseases, analyzing the time-varying genetic effect, along with individual-specific EHR data, will greatly unfold the patient’s specific disease progressions and lead to more precise treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will be searching patient data to determine what form of the APOE gene they carry. Additionally, we are interested in regionality and ethnic differences in APOE gene prevalence. Through patient demographic information we will research if certain groups are at higher risk of carrying the APOE-4 gamete, and thus at a higher risk of later developing Alzheimer’s Disease. Similarly, we will compare gamete prevalence against comorbidities. The APOE gene does not affect Alzheimer’s Disease exclusively; it also is known to correlate with high cholesterol, heart disease, and more. From this information we will determine what other diseases or disorders may indicate a person has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. We would also like to research what lifestyle behaviors increase or decrease the risk of developing these APOE-related diseases and disorders.","Anticipated Findings

The heritability of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is estimated between 60-80%, indicating a strong genetic component to susceptibility to AD; which differs between ancestral populations. Although genetic ancestry has been shown to modify an individual’s risk for AD, the majority of genome-wide association studies and models for the calculation of a polygenic risk score have utilized data derived from populations with mostly European ancestry.

We expect ancestry specific genetic modifiers of AD risk between populations, with risk further modified by proportions of local ancestry spread across the genomes of admixed individuals. Furthermore, we predict that the local ancestry of known genetic modifiers of AD risk differentially influences AD risk when considering global proportions of genetic ancestry as well as non-genetic risk factors of AD such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and social determinants of health. We also predict these data can be leveraged to build an ancestry specific polygenic risk model. We will publish these findings and share the weights used to develop the score (which can be performed in a privacy-preserving fashion) to ensure other parties can leverage our insights and improve biomedical research across AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A large proportion of the human genome is filled with repetitive sequence, including tandem repeats which are short stretches of DNA that are repeated several times in a row. Expansions in tandem repeats can lead to over forty neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We hypothesize that a substantial fraction of previously under-appreciated genetic risk to AD and ALS comes from expansions in additional tandem repeats.  Moreover, the risk of AD is greater in individuals with African ancestry is greater than in individuals of European ancestry. Therefore, we will study tandem repeat length in several populations, including historically underrepresented populations, to ascertain baseline repeat length and sequence composition and search for population-specific tandem repeat expansion events.","Project Purpose(s)

We will compare findings of repeat length with other large cohorts of whole genome sequence data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project and the Answer ALS consortium.","Anticipated Findings
Our goal is to assess tandem repeats prone to expansion to estimate tandem repeat length genome-wide to identify the contribution of novel repeat expansions in disease. Our proposed studies will reveal insight into tandem repeat expansion dynamics and potential novel risk factors for neurodegenerative disease such as AD and ALS.

Treatments for breast and other cancers are often associated with short term cognitive losses. In the long term, however, individuals diagnosed with cancer are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). The reverse is also true; individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer. An improved understanding of how the patterns of inverse comorbidity between the two conditions develop and why the patterns exist will give women diagnosed with cancer accurate information about likely cognitive outcomes and reveal mechanisms
(e.g., related to the immune system) that will allow for the reduction of AD/ADRD risk.
It is especially important that the relationship between cancer and AD/ADRD be disentangled in populations that are diverse across a number of dimensions.
We thus propose to evaluate the patterns of cancer and AD/ADRD diagnosis in All of Us, as well as two large population based cohorts.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to conduct initial analyses by generating polygenic risk scores (PRS) for individual participants based on published GWAS risk variants for 18 individual cancer types and Alzheimer's disease.","Anticipated Findings

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with a huge burden on the society and healthcare system. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States with no effective treatment. Early-onset AD is caused by fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. Late onset AD is caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors with APOE as the strongest genetic risk factor. However, a significant proportion of the elderly remains cognitively intact despite the presence of amyloid-b, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation. We aim to apply our expertise in genetics, artificial intelligence and molecular cell biology to identify risk and protective genetic variants and their combinations to better evaluate and predict risk, resilience and age-of-onset in Alzheimer's disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We will define and use a cohort of AD cases and controls to identify associations with genetic variants. We will use tools optimized for large-scale analyses, such as PLINK, regenie and FBAT. In particular, we will use family-based approaches to analyze a subset of related individuals. We will perform both: single variant and region-based (for WES and WGS) analyses.  Regions will be selected based on variant impact and/or consecutive windows. Furthermore, we will perform stratification by specific variables of interest, such as ethnicity, sex and APOE, and calculate effect estimates in those groups. We will combine these results with other WGS AD and centenarian datasets in a meta-analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to identify new AD risk and/or protective loci with associated rare and low-frequency variants and stratified genetic associations, such as sex- or APOE- specific AD loci. Such loci associated with AD risk and/or cognitive resilience will be then tested using 3D brain models to characterize functional mechanisms.

An antemortem diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) requires costly techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) or invasive methods like measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Other types of dementia like Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) currently have no identified biomarkers comparable to the PET and CSF measures in AD.
Wearable devices have the potential to serve as inexpensive and non-invasive ways to predict dementia type.  Passive collection is also well-suited for elderly individuals, as it avoids relying on subjective recollection and does not interfere with their day-to-day activities.
We will evaluate the ability of machine learning models using wearable devices to predict the type of dementia.

We will define a cohort based on diagnosis codes and age range (higher than 55). We will then develop a pipeline to generate predictive computational models. Our pipeline includes:

2. Map the raw data to derived traits of physical activity and sleep, matching the fitness tracker data measured on the prospective cohort.
3. Account for differences between the prospective study fitness trackers’ digital features and the accelerometer-derived features by having controls wear the two devices concomitantly and generating mapping functions to account for device differences.
4. Generate machine learning models on large datasets and use a transfer-learning methodology to transfer the learned models to the prospective cohort. These machine learning models will be stratified based on sex and comorbidities (e.g., heart problems).","Anticipated Findings

Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will analyze data from the All of Us Research Program database regarding alcohol consumption behaviors, ALDH2 genotype (rs671), demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. All participants with informative data for rs671 will be included in the study. These data sets will be from surveys, physical measurements, and the genomic data set. Statistical analyses will be done using R or python. We will examine relationships between these factors and alcohol consumption using Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables), overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors, for example, demographics.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mosaicism of chromosomes is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. While this age-related phenomenon has been known for many years, awareness of the potential role of mosaicism in human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancers, and cardiovascular disease, is a more recent development. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mosaicism in hematopoietic cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Based on prior studies, cardiac (atrial) inflammation, and fibrosis can result in disruption of normal atrial conduction and is a powerful predictor of risk for the development and progression of atrial fibrillation. In the current study, we aim to better understand the association of mosaicism with the development and progression of AF.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (atrial fibrillation)","Scientific Approaches
We will identify adult subjects with AF in the All of Us Controlled Tier dataset who have undergone genotyping, whole genome sequencing, or whole exome sequencing. We will perform basic statistical testing to examine demographics associated with the presence or absence of mosaicism. Based on these demographics, we will use multivariable regression statistical analyses to assess risk predictors for atrial fibrillation's development and progression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate mosaicism's prevalence in individuals may predict the development and progression of AF. Exploring the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AF incidence and progression may reveal new targets for preventing and treating AF.

Individuals included in the study cohort will be from both sexes, any ethnicity, and at least 60 years old.

The genetic etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is poorly understood. Somatic mutations in the brains with AD and other neurological disorders have been established as a potential mechanism for their pathophysiology. Somatic transposable elements (TEs) are prevalent in individual neurons in the human brain's cerebral cortex, a region long associated with AD progression. Recent work has shown a connection between AD-associated Tau protein-mediated mechanisms with TE activity and somatic mutations. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated TE's role and genomic impact in AD and related dementias in the survey of large-scale cohorts. In this proposal, we aim to employ a genome-wide scan to explore the functional impact of TE in AD and related dementias by leveraging the genomic and phenotypic data in All of Us dataset.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally.

Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)

The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD.

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The goal of this project is to uncover novel early biomarkers and generate prediction models for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on race/ethnicity or dietary habits. The hypothesis is that metabolic dysfunction and diet-associated health issues are predictors for cognitive impairment in a race/ethnicity-specific manner. We propose using medical data obtained from 6 University of California Medical Centers to generate prediction models for AD development based on metabolic disease diagnoses and clinical test results, differentiating by race and ethnicity as well as gender. The long-term objective is to aggressively treat and prevent metabolic diseases prevalent among differing ethnicities, leading to AD prevention.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease and Liver diseases)","Scientific Approaches
The inclusion criteria are patients who are 65-95 years old with and without AD based on ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases).
Diseases that affect liver functions (alcoholic, toxic, failure, chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, inflammation, malignancy, i.e., liver cancer of any types, autoimmune, Wilson’s Disease), Type 2 diabetes melilotus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, as well as nicotine or alcohol dependence will be included for risk predictions. Demographic data and clinical tests that will be included are birth sex, BMI, age at menopause (or hot flash symptom, hemoglobin A1C, glucose blood/urine tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, plasma viscosity, liver function panels, comprehensive metabolic panels, blood count, lipid panels, urinalysis, C reactive protein, and prothrombin time to generate prediction models. All of those are possible indicators of metabolic dysfunction.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to generate good prediction models and to be able to quantify the importance of metabolic clinical features for AD identification. If the learned model is not sufficiently accurate on held-back data, we will retrain the models from scratch using more domain knowledge to reduce the complexity of the prediction tasks. We will also explore the possibility of using a similar dataset to pre-train a model or to select appropriate features. If the data does not match with the known National data, we will look into patient population and barriers to access within the UC system. The benchmarks for success are measured by: (1) the identification of disparities in AD as well as metabolic diseases in the UC system; (2) the generation of good models for predicting AD based on race and ethnicity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In addition, we will apply methods described in the MIST software and compare with standard statistical methods using the AD datasets in All of Us.

Itch is a common clinical phenomenon which worsens with age, and up to one-third of elderly patients report clinically significant itch with moderate impact on their quality of life. Itch and neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease are also significantly associated in aging humans. For example, bullous pemphigoid – a pruritic autoimmune skin disorder whose incidence rises with age – increases the odds of dementia by 10-fold (95% confidence interval 5.4-17.8]). The association between age-related non-neoplastic skin conditions and neurological disorders can be due to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, exposure) or upstream pathophysiology (systemic inflammation, inflammaging), but studies dissecting these potential mechanistic relationships are lacking. In this study, I intend to evaluate the association between dementia and pruritus in an aging population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)","Scientific Approaches
I will use descriptive statistics to characterize pruritic skin diseases in patients with and without dementia including demographic information, inflammatory skin diseases, dementia subtypes, other comorbid medical conditions, and use of specific medications that have been associated with the development of dementia in prior literature (e.g. sedating anti-histamines). I will use basic statistical techniques to assess these relationships including chi-squared analyses, t-tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear multivariable linear regression models.","Anticipated Findings

First, we will first conduct a systematic review of SAE prediction models that use RWD, especially EHRs.  Second, informed by the systematic review and built upon our prior work, we will use the RWD from All of Us to analyze and model the mathematical relationships among criteria (i.e., study traits), generalizability, and outcomes (i.e., SAEs) to understand how adjustments to eligibility criteria will jointly affect AD trials’ generalizability and real-world target AD patients’ outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We will support the development of a trial eligibility criteria design tool that can optimize trial generalizability while balancing potential increases in the risk of SAEs in the target population.

Neurological diseases such as Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias can have direct or indirect impacts on day-to-day psychosocial and health behaviors (e.g., activities of daily living, healthcare utilization, self care). Little is known about the impact of neurological diseases in the sexual and gender minority populations. and as sexual and gender minority populations may experience differences in social support and other impacts of structural inequities we would like to know the following:
1) Does the impact of having Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (PD/ADRD) on psychosocial behavioral health, or well-being differ between sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and cisgender, heterosexual (CGH) individuals?
1a) Are there any differences between sexuality and gender identity subpopulations?
2) Comparing SGM and CGH individuals with PD/ADRD are there differences in comorbid conditions?","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will first identify all of those individuals with valid Sexual Orientation and Gender identity concept answers in the controlled tier dataset, and then among those we will identify the sub population with PD/ADRD diagnoses, and then among that cohort of individuals we will evaluate differences among cohort members based on sex-assigned-at-birth, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
We will use univariate (measures of central tendency, frequencies/distributions) and bivariate statistics (significant differences between groups). Differences will be assessed using the appropriate within and between groups comparisons approaches based on the type of measures used e.g [M]AN[C]OVA ([multiple] analysis of [co-]variance).
If the population of affected individuals is large enough we may evaluate complex relationships among the various psychosocial health and well-being factors using partial correlations, logistic regressions, or other multivariable analyses if appropriate.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate being able to provide some specific descriptive work related to the All-of-us sample, and any group differences that exist. At this point in time the a priori hypothesis is that SGM individuals will have a poorer psychosocial health and well-being than their CGH comparators. When we finish this work we hope that this will generate information that will spark further inquiry and opportunities to conduct studies to better understand and address any disparities that are identified among SGM individuals with PD/ADRD.
Further, descriptive analyses that examine data in the aggregate as well disaggregated data (by groups) and using analyses that allow us to account for intersecting marginalized identities are important for understanding which groups are at greatest risk for poor outcomes. We we anticipate that differences to exist in both the combined and disaggregated analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will analyze the potential different mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease, using parameters including medicines from EHR records, genetic backgrounds, questionnaires, blood test lab parameters, etc.
Specific questions we will ask are:
1. How the points of AD patients are presented in the high-dimension space? Are there any cluster structures? Is it possible to reduce the dimensions?
2. What are the high dimension structures of the age/sex mapping controls related to AD patients?
3. If we identified some clusters in point1, what’s the potential contributions of aging to different clusters. Is it possible to predict AD risks for certain clusters for the younger population?
They are hundreds of potential factors that are associated with AD. We hypothesis that some of those factors shared the same pathological pathways, and thus would cluster in the high dimension space. We expected to conclude some relative independent major driven factors for AD.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
We will apply algorithms developed at Columbia University and in the OHDSI network to All of Us data to find medication sequences. We will use Python and BigQuery to (1) retrieve AD patients and the HER, questionnaires and Genomic information. (2) Filter the data with AD risk factors and visualize their structures in high dimensional space. (3) Clustering the data using various clustering and dimensional reduction methods to check potential clusters; (4) Analyzing contribution factors to each potential clusters. (5) Analyzing the structure of cognitive normal subjects with similar AD risk factors. We will engage community partners to review our hypotheses, approach, and study limitations. Limitations include: 1. medication reports may not tell us how well people adhered to their prescribed therapy; 2. High heterogeneity and relative small sample size in the data might result in biased clusters.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show several distinct clusters in AD patients, which may due to different pathological mechanisms in AD which require different therapeutic strategies. We expect to find (1) subtypes of AD; (2) potential contribution factors to different subtypes; (3) effect size of different risk factors to different subtypes; (4)potential predictive model to AD; (5) and potential therapeutic strategies to different AD sub types. Importantly, the detailed code developed will be made available within the Researcher Workbench, so other researchers may more easily repeat our study or applie similar research strategies to other diseases. We believe this approach will be useful in many discovery studies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Delirium, a severe medical condition prevalent among older patients, is often linked to various risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), potentially due to shared mechanisms increasing dementia susceptibility. Intriguingly, research suggests that metformin, a medication for DM, not only extends lifespan but also reduces delirium risk in DM patients. Additionally, exploring metformin's effects on genome-wide DNA methylation have shed light on its mechanisms, including pathways related to longevity, AMPK, inflammation, and HIF-1 alpha. However, a deeper understanding of metformin's role in longevity and its impact on delirium risk is warranted. To address this gap, our study aims to investigate metformin's potential influence on delirium risk as well as mortality risk, and also investigate genetic profiles modulating such potential association by examining genome-wide genetic status in patients with and without a history of delirium.","Project Purpose(s)

- Investigate the prevalence of delirium among individuals with and without a history of metformin use, stratified by the status for diabetes mellitus.
- Compare the frequency of SNP alleles related to delirium as a trait among the population first. Then we evaluate the difference of such potential association between participants who have used metformin and those who have not to investigate the potential interaction between genotype and medical use history.","Anticipated Findings
Conducting the described research study could yield several anticipated findings that can contribute significantly to the field of delirium, pharmacogenomics, and the potential interaction between medication use and genetic predispositions. Findings may reveal a lower prevalence of delirium among individuals with a history of metformin use compared to those without such a history, particularly among those with diabetes mellitus. In addition, findings might indicate a differential effect of metformin on individuals with different genetic predispositions towards delirium. Overall, the anticipated findings from this research study could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between metformin use, genetic factors, and the pathophysiology of delirium, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical care, risk assessment, and potentially the development of targeted interventions for preventing or managing delirium in at-risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

(i) Which specific genetic variants predispose people to being more vulnerable to delirium?
(ii) Which modifiable risk factors and circulating proteins affect risk of delirium?
(iii) Is delirium a cause and/or consequence of dementia and frailty?
Delirium is an acute neurocognitive disorder that affects up to 50% of hospitalized patients over the age of 65. Delirium can be thought of as 'acute brain failure,' with serious consequences for patients including longer hospital stays and greater risk of cognitive and functional decline, and death. It remains unclear if delirium is an early sign of dementia/frailty or a modifiable mediator. There is a need to improve current prevention and treatment strategies, which starts with a better understanding of the underlying risk factors and biological mechanisms precipitating delirium. Genetic studies may help offer new insights into pathogenesis, help disentangle complex relationships with dementia and frailty, and uncover novel drug targets.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (delirium)
Drug Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
First, we will characterize the association between common (MAF>0.005) genetic variants and delirium status (any history of hospitalized delirium episode) by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within each ancestry using a logistic mixed model (SAIGE) and adjusting for age, sex, and top genetic principal components. Results from ancestry-specific GWAS will be combined via meta-analysis (MANTRA and METAL). Second, using the resulting summary statistics, we will perform Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to identify putative mediators of delirium including (a) modifiable risk factors (e.g. physical activity) and (b) druggable circulating proteins (e.g. inflammatory cytokines). Third, MR will also be used to assess potential bidirectional relationships between delirium vs. dementia and frailty. Finally, to corroborate genes identified by GWAS, rare variant association testing will be conducted testing rare mutation burden of each gene with delirium status (SAIGE-GENE) .","Anticipated Findings
Some individuals may have more fragile vs. resilient brains as a result of genetic predisposition. For example, it is known that homozygote APOE ε4 carriers are at four-fold elevated risk of delirium but beyond the APOE locus, no other genetic variations have been consistently associated despite strong estimated heritability. Accordingly, our study will contribute to identifying novel genetic risk factors for delirium. It will also help prioritize causal modifiable risk factors to help better inform public health policies for prevention in the elderly. This study will also help better elucidate the mechanisms and specific circulating proteins mediating risk of delirium, which may lead to the development of the first effective pharmacotherapies to treat delirium. Finally, GWAS results could be operationalized into polygenic risk scores which could complement and enhance existing clinical risk prediction models for delirium by capturing an innate component of brain vulnerability.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Anticholinergic (AC) drugs are medications used to treat various conditions like depression, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and bladder problems, especially as people age and develop more health issues. Over time, the use of these medications has increased significantly, particularly among frail older adults. However, AC medications can sometimes lead to problems like confusion, memory loss, and falls in older individuals. Therefore, it's important to develop tools that can help doctors estimate a person's AC medication use and predict their risk of experiencing these side effects. A tool called the AC Medication Index (ACMI) was recently developed using the UK 'Connected Bradford' general practice database. This tool helps identify patients at high risk of experiencing side effects from AC medications, such as delirium or falls. We are now using this tool to study the connection between AC medication use and dementia using the UK Biobank and All of Us Research Program data.","Project Purpose(s)

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide. However, about half of cancer cases are preventable as they are linked to modifiable risk factors. The identification of individuals at high risk for cancer can help enhance the efficiency of cancer screening and develop effective cancer prevention programs. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used for cancer prediction, including the prediction of cancer susceptibility (i.e., risk assessment), with acceptable performance reported before. However, few studies have explored cancer risk prediction for people with multimorbidity, including those with cognitive impairment such as dementia, who face challenges in health self-management and care decision-making. Research questions of this study are focused on (1) what are high-ranked risk factors for breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers? (2) how do these risk factors differ between people with dementia (and/or mild cognitive impairment) and those without?","Project Purpose(s)

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians. The Li Lab here at UC Irvine uses a variety of computational methods to find different types of genomic patterns in an unbiased manner. With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging.

Iron has essential biological functions but too much can result in the iron overload disease hemochromatosis. This is predominantly caused by mutations in the HFE gene, especially the p.C282Y genetic variant. However, patients experience dramatically different disease trajectories, and we have studied factors influencing outcomes in the UK Biobank (PMIDs: 30651232 & 35567766), including the first report that those with two copies of this mutation have increased risk of dementia (doi:10.3233/jad-201080). Yet whether this extends to other populations is unknown. We aim to study participants with combinations of the HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D variants in the All of Us cohort to characterise penetrance of these iron overload associated genetic variants to key outcomes (liver disease, dementia) plus investigate modifiers of the penetrance, including non-HFE genetic variants known to increase iron levels, plus obesity, and other risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the microarray genotype data to extract iron overload variants in HFE as well as other iron increasing variants from published studies. Whilst the main hemochromatosis mutation (p.C282Y) is most common in individuals of European genetic ancestry (https://databrowser.researchallofus.org/variants/rs1800562) we will extend the findings investigating more diverse genetic groups. Health outcomes will be ascertained from the OMOP data, especially liver disease (the severe clinical outcome of iron overload) but also dementia. We will use `Plink` to extract genotype information, and `R` to perform the statistical analyses. We will utilize the following participant information, where available, to characterise the genotype carriers and include as risk factors/covariates: age, sex, obesity, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate confirming known associations between HFE p.C282Y and liver disease in this new study, and replicating our recent finding that p.C282Y homozygotes also have increased risk of dementia, especially non-Alzheimer's dementia. This will contribute to the literature by extending the finding to the US population, including more diverse populations. We anticipate clarifying the effect of risk factors in the other (contested) genotype combination (such as C282Y-H63D compound heterozygotes). We also anticipate that non-HFE genetic variants that impact iron will be associated with penetrance (clinical severity) within the HFE p.C282Y homozygotes, and in the general population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.

With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings

• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations.

CADASIL is a slow onset, rare genetic disease caused by NOTCH3 gene variants, leading to lesions in the white matter of the brain, migraines, recurrent strokes and dementia/memory loss. Not only is CADASIL genotypically diverse (variants span the whole gene), it is also phenotypically heterogeneous with individuals that have the same variant presenting with very different symptoms as well as variable diseases progression. Lastly, current treatments are palliative and there is little prospect of future therapies to directly address causation and block progression of the disease.
We hypothesize that this heterogeneity is partially driven by risk factors, lifestyle, environmental components and genetic modifiers. This database will enable us to identify the frequency and the distribution of NOTCH3 variants in the enrolled population as well as use available demographic, lifestyle and genetic data to parse out potential disease modifiers that may alter the course of CADASIL.","Project Purpose(s)

We also plan to use available genomic data to identify the frequency of potential genetic modifiers that are known (per literature) to play a role in vascular dementia conditions that, if overlapping with a NOTCH3 mutation, could explain the heterogeneity of CADASIL.","Anticipated Findings

Advances in the ability to predict disease using genetics have been enabled by large genome wide association studies and methods that can combine multiple genetic risk factors such as polygenic risk scores (PRS). The predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores for dementia has predominantly been studied in cohorts where phenotypes have been defined by autopsy or strict clinical diagnostic criteria. In practice, healthcare providers diagnose dementia during life without reviewing strict diagnostic criteria. Healthcare provider inform patients of their diagnosis and/or enter these diagnoses in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition, many polygenic risk dementia studies have been performed in individuals of European ancestry. Our objective is to evaluate polygenic risk scores for dementia based on phenotypes from the EHR among different ancestry groups. Improving genetic predictive models of dementia can aid in early diagnosis and treatment of dementias.","Project Purpose(s)

Using the All of Us genetic and clinical data, we will use a case control design where cases are defined by the dementia or related phenotype and controls are adults without those phenotypes. We will compute polygenic risk scores using methods such as LDPRED2. We will also consider PRS using multiple neurodegenerative diseases, PRS different genetic ancestries, and utilizing advanced machine learning models. We will evaluate the accuracy of these PRS to predict cases. We will control and stratify results by variables including age, sex, known genetic risk factors such as APOE and MAPT haplotype, and self-reported and genetic ancestry.","Anticipated Findings

The overall goal of this project is twofold: (1) to explore the relationship between biopsychosocial (i.e., physical, mental, psychosocial), and neurocognitive impairment, and factors associated with healthcare access and utilization among older people living with HIV (PLWH) and (2) to evaluate the primary genetic markers of dementia among older PLWH. This project seeks to:
1. Assess the relationships between social position, ART characteristics by age at diagnosis, and cognitive characteristics among older PLWH.
2. Examine the relationships between social position, cognitive characteristics, healthcare access and utilization (insurance, type of provider, affordability, provide demographics) among older PLWH.
3. Elucidate the frequency of the APOE4 and TREM2 genes (genetic markers of dementia) among older PLWH.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the controlled tier of the most recent dataset to examine these relationships. For the first aim, descriptive statistics will be calculated for the physical, mental, cognitive, sociodemographic, ART, and time of diagnosis characteristics in addition to the responses from the questions included the in the Health Care Access & Utilization survey. Bivariate analyses will then be conducted to determine the independent associations between physical, mental, sociodemographic, and ART characteristics, stratified by age of diagnosis, current age (50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+), and cognitive status (impairment vs. non-impairment). Multiple logistic regressions will be conducted to model the different relationships between the physical, mental, sociodemographic, and ART characteristics, stratified by current age, age of diagnosis, and cognitive status. Interactions will also be tested. We will also examine the frequency of the APOE4 and TREM2 genes.","Anticipated Findings
Hypothesis 1:  Older PLWHA and those living with HIV longer will have more adverse biopsychosocial and cognitive health challenges compared to those who were more recently diagnosed and younger.
Hypothesis 2: Those who are more disadvantaged based on sociodemographic classification will have more adverse biopsychosocial and cognitive health challenges and will not be as engaged in ART.
Hypothesis 3 Older PLWHA and those living with HIV longer will access and utilize healthcare more frequently than those who were more recently diagnosed and younger.

I hope to answer whether speech/gait profiles can differentiate dementia types. The escalating pervasiveness of dementia has placed a huge burden on the health and social care systems, making accurate identification of dementia crucial. The differential identification of dementia types in clinical settings relies heavily on the combination of expensive neuroimaging panel and invasive biomarker testing, which makes it difficult to apply such exams to every person with cognitive complaints. In addition, similar cognitive symptoms among these dementia types leave clinicians to the challenging task of differentiating the type of dementia. The analysis of speech/gait markers may lead to the development of a non-invasive and cost-efficient tool for differential diagnosis of dementia. This will assist healthcare professionals in identifying the ever-increasing cognitive conditions to facilitate the development of appropriate treatments and managements plans, tailored to each type of dementia.","Project Purpose(s)

We expect to find distinct differences between Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital and dementia patients admitted to hospital with an acute Covid-19 diagnosis. In many cases, dementia patients have preexisting damage to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) due to a chronic state of inflammation, allowing the viral particles direct access to the brain (Wang et al., 2021). SARS-Cov2 has been shown to induce the release of cytokines IL1, IL-16, TNF-α, exacerbating inflammation and causing further injury to the BBB (Fotuhi et al., 2020). Entry of viral particles and blood material into the CSF can result in thrombotic events, seizures, and encephalitis, all of which can lead to fatal outcomes (Wang et al., 2021). This leaves patients with dementia extremely vulnerable to the development of inflammatory cytokine storms and hypercoagulation cascades common in COVID-19.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Educational","Scientific Approaches
To capture the temporal progression of this neurodegenerative disease, the cohort age will be 30 years old and above. All races and ethnicities will be included, as well as all gender identities. Disability status, education level, access to healthcare, sexual orientation, rural vs urban living, and income level will also be included. Correlation statistics will be used.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate seeing economically disadvantaged demographics will show a higher rate of dementia diagnosis. This would elucidate potential avenues of investigation for treating or preventing the onset of the disease, be it through improved nutrition, improved access to healthcare screenings, etc.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The initial part of this research will be data exploration in the hope of being able to create an analysis pipeline that can answer the question ""what are the genetic, behavioral and socio-demographic that can determine the risk of developing Dementia and memory loss? How do they interact with each other?"".
The answers to these questions can be relevant for public health, since they could help develop prevention strategies and understand the real impact of external exposures on the development of these common impairing conditions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I will explore several datasets: genomic data, survey questions (selecting subjects reporting dementia and memory loss), lifestyle, physical activity and demographic. Exploratory analyses will be carried out to characterize the subjects, followed by a clustering/stratification analysis to see whether there are identifiable subgroups of patients. After that, multilevel and hierarchical analysis methods such as Mediation Analysis, Bayesian Networks and Mixed-effects Models will be used to inspect the contribution of different genetic and external factors to the development of the aforementioned conditions. If possible, I might integrate some external datasets about other environmental data.","Anticipated Findings
Possible findings could be that some environmental, social or behavioral factors could impact the development or exacerbation of the conditions more than others, and therefore they should be the starting point for prevention strategies. It could be also possible to find that interactions between factors change depending on the genetic predisposition of the patients, therefore allowing to develop precision medicine techniques.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes, cardiovascualar diseases and dementia are the major challenges to human health, which are determined by genetic susceptibility, environmental risk factors, and their interactions. However, the evidence on the G×E (genetic facotrs* environmental factors) interaction and unconfounded estimates of a modifiable exposure is still laking.
