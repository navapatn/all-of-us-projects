Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are available for a wide array of traits and conditions, offering many potential applications. There is a serious concern that clinical use of PRS could contribute to health disparities due to the poorer performance of PRS in non-European ancestry individuals. We aim to improve our ability to correct the genetic ancestry-dependent bias in PRS for 10 conditions (Asthma, Atrial fibrillation, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary heart disease, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity/BMI, Prostate cancer, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes). We will use the AoU dataset to produce a resource that can be used to reduce the ancestry-dependent bias in these 10 PRS.  The citation for this work is:

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide, with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Understanding the genetic basis of asthma is crucial for advancing our knowledge of its pathogenesis and developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Beyond its direct respiratory effects, asthma is associated with a range of comorbidities, including internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression.
The burden of asthma extends beyond individual suffering to encompass significant societal and economic impacts.
Investigating genetic variants associated with asthma susceptibility and severity can pave the way for personalized medicine approaches. By identifying individuals at higher genetic risk, healthcare providers can tailor interventions and treatments to better manage asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (asthma)","Scientific Approaches
Use GWAS databases such as NHGRI-EBI catalog and GWAS central to find genes that are linked to asthma susceptibility or related phenotypes. Based on previous research on this subject for a previous assignment, further discussions will be limited to SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL3 genes.
Analyze genomic sequencing data and perform variant calling using libraries like GATK. Filter the variants for SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL3 genes using BED tools.
Identify genetic variants that have been previously associated with asthma susceptibility in GWAS datasets.
Cross-reference identified asthma-associated variants with gene-disease association data from DisGeNET.
Explore the strength of evidence supporting the association between the variants and asthma in DisGeNET, considering factors such as the number of supporting studies and their experimental designs.
Determine a significance threshold for the variants based on statistical significance.","Anticipated Findings
The expected outcome of the project is the identification of specific genetic variants within the SMAD3, GSDMB, IL4, and IL13 genes that are associated with asthma susceptibility and severity. Identify how these variants affect gene expression and protein functions implicated in asthma pathophysiology. Understanding the functional consequences of these genetic variants will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma development and progression. Analyze the clinical data from asthma patients with known genotypes and determine whether specific genetic profiles are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and disease severity.
As a stretch goal, identify the role of environmental factors in disease susceptibility and severity for the individuals with the asthma causing genotype.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Toxic airborne exposures contribute to asthma development, but the mechanisms that connect exposure with asthma biology and the individual risk factors that contribute to this effect are not understood. We have approached this problem by identifying genetic variants that associate with asthma risk and change transcriptional responses to a model of wildfire particulate matter in cell culture.

We will perform genotype-phenotype association to compare the effect of 52 variants on asthma phenotype in a case-control analysis. We will compare the minor allele frequencies for these 52 variants in cases and controls using a one degree of freedom chi squared test and adjust for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. We will then add the important biologic covariates of age, body mass index and smoking history into the association using a logistic regression model.","Anticipated Findings
These results will validate our initial findings of these 52 common variants that develop a mechanistic connection between wildfire particulate exposure and asthma risk.

Research Question: Are leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, potential repurposable drug candidates for multiple sclerosis?
Significance: Despite recent advancements in MS therapeutics, it remains that several patients still experience treatment-resistant MS. Previously, we pinpointed a repurposable drug candidate for MS via bioinformatics analyses of genomic data, a leukotriene receptor antagonist currently indicated for allergic rhinitis or asthma.* Therefore, montelukast, a widely used leukotriene receptor antagonist, may be provide a new approach for managing MS symptoms.

Previous studies have shown that living somewhere with high levels of air pollution makes it more likely that a person will develop asthma. While in the long term we need to decrease air pollution levels nationwide, we urgently need ways to protect people exposed to air pollution. To do this, we need to understand how being exposed to air pollution leads to asthma. Knowing which genetic variants make a person more likely to develop asthma when they are exposed to air pollution can help us with this. First, because it may show us which people are especially at risk and therefor allow us to target these people with screening or public health interventions and second, because these genetic variants may point to certain biological processes that we can then target with medications.","Project Purpose(s)

This project aims to enhance pharmacogenetics and equity in severe asthma (SA) by developing statistical learning models. Despite comprising less than 10% of asthma cases, SA significantly burdens patients and healthcare systems, accounting for over 50% of asthma-related healthcare utilization. While most asthma patients respond to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), approximately one-third show minimal or no response. Various factors, including demographics, socioeconomics, environment, and emerging genetic evidence, contribute to SA. Notably, African Americans (AAs) face a four times higher hospitalization risk and seven times higher mortality rate from asthma compared to non-AAs. Existing asthma risk assessment techniques lack precision for minorities. This study will explore the impact of demographics, genetics, and social determinants on ICS response in SA patients of African and European ancestries.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We utilized the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) to study the impact of ICS on patients with SA. Our criteria include asthma diagnosis (ICD codes 493.x or J45.x), self-reported AA or Non-Hispanic White (NHW) ethnicity, age six or older, active ICS prescription, and availability of WES genomics data. The cohort is divided into ICS responders (controls) and non-responders (cases), with non-responders experiencing ED visits or inpatient hospitalizations related to asthma within 24 months from their first ICS prescription.
Data preprocessing involves MAF and HWE filtering, LD pruning using PLINK and imputation, dimensionality reduction and training predictive models using Python packages. Evaluation employs stratified 10-fold cross-validation with performance metrics calculation. Post-hoc analysis is done by using SHAP and LIME and GSEA tools.","Anticipated Findings
Hypothesis: Identify variants that contribute to ICS response (or lack thereof) in populations with African and European ancestries. The proposed ML pipeline will identify genetic variants that will predict ICS response within each population. This hypothesis is currently understudied due to the lack of previous focus on pharmacogenetics of ICS, especially for populations with African ancestry. We will test this hypothesis by developing and validating ML pipelines to predict ICS response using data from UTHSC and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). If successful, this research will not only inform treatment planning in asthma patients but create one of the first comprehensive machine learning (ML) pipelines in genomics that integrates demographics, and E/SDH context in pharmacogenetics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A large proportion of human diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, T2D and asthma) are caused by genetic or epigenetic changes. These changes thus can serve as biomarkers for disease detection or drug targets for disease treatment. The Next Generation Sequencing technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation sequencing, have been widely used to detect such (epi-)genetic changes. However, systematic analysis multidimensional genomic data makes things more complex and has become a big challenge in the field. New approaches are urgently needed to be developed. In this project, we will develop novel and powerful computational methods to systematically discover the potential biomarker and drug target in cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, lung diseases, asthma, T2D, and many other metabolism diseases based on these multidimensional genomic data.","Project Purpose(s)

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are different disorders that may coexist in individual patients. Patients with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) have a greater disease burden and worse health outcomes than patients with either condition alone. To date, much of our knowledge of ACO has been extrapolated from asthma and COPD studies, which often excluded individuals with ACO. We aim to discover novel genetic risk factors of ACO and related sub-phenotypes likely caused by a range of different underlying mechanisms. While smoking causes most cases of COPD, some never-smokers develop COPD and some life-long heavy smokers do not. This study aims to perform genome-wide association studies and gene-by-environmental interaction analyses within the AllOfUs dataset to: 1) investigate genetic commonalities and differences among ACO and each disease alone, and 2) identify how smoking and non-smoking risk factors are at play in their pathophysiology.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We focus on Asthma and COPD diagnoses in AllOfUs, excluding cystic fibrosis cases. We classify explicit ACO diagnoses and individuals with both diseases as ACO cases. Our GWAS targets latent dimensions of these diagnoses and related features, including various related diseases and measurements with analogous features in UK Biobank for SNP hit validation. We hypothesize that continuous features from related phenotypes may yield stronger SNP associations than logistic regression on heterogeneous binary phenotypes, and the latent dimensions may also represent distinct interpretable clinical manifestations of otherwise heterogeneous diseases. We will analyze the genome-wide genotyping data for associations with these latent dimensions and assess interactions with environmental factors using regression models. We will use feature importance methods to ascertain which input features are responsible for the correlations with interesting SNP hits.","Anticipated Findings
Asthma, COPD, and ACO are heterogeneous diseases that likely include a number of phenotypes with distinct clinical and genetic identifiers. We can compare which genetically estimated latent dimensions significantly contribute to each of these heterogeneous diseases. In addition to comparing the genetic basis of three deeply confounded diseases, we also hope to discover novel genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions that open opportunities for disease prevention and therapeutic intervention.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma affects 339 million people worldwide and the total is expected to reach 400 million by 2025. Further, asthma disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic groups, with higher prevalence and more severe outcomes among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations. The reasons for these disparities are complex and include genetic factors and environmental exposures. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified susceptibility loci for asthma, little is known about genetic determinants that may explain racial disparities of asthma. Also, previous observational studies indicate that the mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation may differ between asthmatic smokers and non-smokers. However, the genetic characteristics and differences between these groups are unknown. Therefore, we will identify novel loci contributing to racial disparities of asthma, and compare genetic factors associated with asthma exacerbation between smokers and non-smokers.","Project Purpose(s)

Despite progress in therapeutic approaches, according to CDC about 50% of individuals with asthma continue to experience asthma attack (Asthma exacerbation) every year. Asthma attack is an acute episode of progressively worsening of asthma symptoms. Uncontrolled asthma (episodes of asthma exacerbation) can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, healthcare cost and burden, and time away from school and work. Predicting when exacerbation may occur with adequate intervention would reduce healthcare burden, save cost, and improve quality of life. However, efficient methods that can help identify personalized risk factors and make early predictions are lacking. The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and calculate saved healthcare cost. All of Us Research  database with about 35,000 asthma diagnosed patients and about 10,000 asthma attack events provide an opportunity to build a prediction model.","Project Purpose(s)

African ancestry in individuals in the US often represents admixture among several African population groups, in addition to non-African ancestries such as European and Native American. It is also known that disease prevalence and manifestation vary with individuals' ancestral backgrounds partly because of different genetic variations and linkage structure in genomes. Since the genomes of admixed individuals appear like a mosaic of ancestry-specific genomic tracts, we can  identify ancestry-specific disease associated loci by ascertaining these tracts using local ancestry inference techniques.  This is especially important as most genetic studies underrepresent admixed populations and we have little knowledge on them.  Thus, in this study, we aim to construct fine-scale genetic ancestry in individuals with African descent and identify the relationship between ancestry and prevalence of chronic diseases such as asthma and COPD.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use the methods PCA, ADMIXTURE and fineSTRUCTURE to assess population structure of individuals of African descent from the All of Us dataset against a reference panel enriched for African ancestral populations. We should find several African ancestry derived from different populations in African continent as well as ancestries from other continent in the genomes of individuals of African descent. Then, we will infer local ancestry across genome using RFMix, ELAI, and MOSAIC. The accuracy of our local ancestry inference will be validated by comparing the global mean values with the results of ADMIXTURE. Then, we will conduct admixture mapping, association test between local ancestry tracts and disease status to find ancestry-specific disease associated loci.   We will use status of alcohol drinking , smoking, insurance, deprivation index to correct socio-racial influence to reduce the risk of stigmatization for a particular population group.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesized that different African ancestries can be identified in the genome, and that each of these ancestries show different correlations to complex disease outcomes since Africans have much more genetic variations compared to other populations and most of which were not well studied so far. Fine-scale, local ancestry information will enable us to find population-specific associations and understand the contribution of ancestry to disease risk.  Our findings will contribute to understanding the genetic basis of chronic disease in populations under-represented in genomic studies, such as African Americans.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asthma is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Unraveling the role of genetic factors like FABP4 variants could provide valuable insights into the disease's pathogenesis, contribute to improved risk prediction models, and potentially pave the way for personalized therapeutic strategies. Our primary scientific question revolves around understanding the role of FABP4 gene variants in the pathogenesis and progression of asthma. Specifically, we are investigating the following queries: Are FABP4 gene variants associated with an increased risk of developing asthma? Do these genetic variants affect the severity or control of asthma symptoms? Are there significant interactions between these FABP4 genetic variants and environmental factors that may modulate asthma risk and severity?","Project Purpose(s)

Our study will investigate the role of FABP4 genetic variants in asthma. We will focus our work on adults and compare the prevalence of asthma diagnosis between those with and without FABP4 variants. We will also attempt to compare the prevalence of FABP4 genetic variants in asthma disease severity through an estimation of the asthma controller medications that are used (eg. Inhaled corticosteroids, or targeted biologic therapies). We will compare differences in participant characteristics using simple descriptive statistics and report the prevalence of genetic variants in asthma (by severity) compared to non-asthma participants.","Anticipated Findings
We expect there to be a greater proportion of FABP4 genetic variants in the asthma cohort compared to non-asthma.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children worldwide, and displays the greatest disparities among all diseases in the United States. Children living in urban neighborhoods have disproportionately higher rates of asthma symptoms. Recent study showed that African Americans (AAs) are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from asthma than European Americans (EAs). Therefore we sought to determine whether asthma racial ancestry differences are modulated by gene, allergic comorbidities, and socioenvironmental exposure risk factors. We will identify genomic and other exposures association in different group of children from the all of us network. In addition, we aim to evaluate that asthmatics and healthy individuals are geographically clustered in specific locations potentially race-driven socio-environmental exposure risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

A major strength of this research is the existence of a well-characterized multi-site asthma cohort with infrastructure that links genetic, non-genetic factors into a single dataset. The population of interest are children and adolescents,0-21 years old, admitted  for an asthma exacerbation that are identified on an ongoing basis by research staff via electronic admission diagnosis of asthma and/or clinician activation of the treatment order set for an asthma exacerbation. We will make use of a simplified evidence synthesis protocol to select environmental covariates of interest to asthma. Then, an implied graph will be built to infer causal effects to the dataset. Finally, backdoor criterion will be used to remove any open paths, check for colliders and over control in the implied graph. Complementarily, we will perform a Variance Inflated Factor (VIF) stepwise model selection to account for multicollinearity. Multivariate models will depend from the nature of the analyzed outcome.","Anticipated Findings

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.

The datasets will include participants who are diagnosed with asthma.

Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to see if an elevated TyG measurement is associated with asthma exacerbations after adjusting for known confounders (demographic variables, comorbidities, body mass index, asthma and metabolic medication use, prior exacerbation, and eosinophil count).","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that among All of Us participants with asthma, elevated TyG will be associated with an increased hazard of asthma exacerbation, independent of known risk factors.

Asthma demonstrates high prevalence with both sex and ancestry disparities apparent in the United States. Previous studies have identified X chromosome variants as possible contributors to existing sex disparities in asthma prevalence. Existing literature also indicates that individuals with African ancestry, including African Americans, bear greater asthma risk than individuals of European and Native American ancestry. Local ancestry estimates on the X chromosome differ greatly within African descent populations. Despite the awareness of how sex and ancestry separately influence asthma susceptibility, existing literature fails to examine their interaction. Previous literature often fails to thoroughly examine asthma susceptibility in individuals of African descent, contributing to inequitable advancements in precision medicine and further driving health disparities. We hypothesize that sex moderates the effect of ancestry-specific X chromosome risk factors for asthma susceptibility.","Project Purpose(s)

The interaction between GERD and COPD has long been recognized as excess gastric acid can exacerbate COPD and symptoms of COPD, such as cough, can contribute to GERD. Micro-aspiration of gastric contents and/or vagal reflex induced bronchospasm might contribute to the association between GERD and COPD. In COPD, increased intra-abdominal pressure and negative intra-thoracic pressure, increased cough frequency, and medications may contribute to GERD. Despite the high prevalence of GERD in COPD and medications for GERD that have been shown to improve other pulmonary disease such as asthma, the etiological relationship between GERD and COPD has not been adequately elucidated.

The heritability of co-morbid COPD and GERD will be estimated using both LD-regression and linear mixed models. Mediation analyses will be employed to examine the role of common SNPs associated with COPD and GERD identified using GWAS analysis on COPD as mediated by GERD.","Anticipated Findings
COPD is irreversible; however, improving our understanding of the etiology of comorbid GERD and COPD could serve to improve COPD diagnosis and treatment. This research will provide novel information regarding the mechanism of GERD in COPD pathogenesis and novel genetic markers that could be used as therapeutic targets or biomarkers to provide timely interventions. Future directions of this research will involve integrative ‘omics and functional genomic methods such as SNP enrichment, co-localization, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to investigate the role of significant findings in the mechanisms underlying GERD in COPD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (substance use disorders)","Scientific Approaches
We will examine the relationship between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder and CRP by regressing CRP on the cannabis use measures in the All of Us dataset. All models will control for covariates including age, sex, race and BMI. We may construct additional models that covary for comorbid conditions such as depression or asthma. Additionally, we will examine demographic counts for the variables of interest in our study.","Anticipated Findings
We would anticipate to find an association between cannabis use and CRP levels, with cannabis use in the last three months being associated with lower CRP levels. On the other hand, we would expect to find that cannabis use disorder (or some other measure of heavy use) is associated with higher CRP levels. This project could help untangle how the relationship between cannabis use and CRP changes according to level of cannabis use.

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.

There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions.

Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are the two most common respiratory diseases. Therefore, understanding the characteristics and frequency of participants with either of these diseases in the US by analyzing the All of Us database has public health implications.

Other Purpose (This work is the result of an All of Us Research Program Demonstration Project. Demonstration Projects are efforts by the All of Us Research Program designed to meet the goal of ensuring the quality and utility of the Research Hub as a resource for accelerating precision medicine. This work has been approved, reviewed, and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy.)","Scientific Approaches
Standard statistical analysis will be used to determine the frequency of asthma or COPD diagnoses in the EHR and surveys in relationship to gender, age, BMI, race, educational status as a reflection of socioeconomic status (SES), regions of the country, co-morbidities and smoking status. Results will be compared to published data including the CDC. Since COPD is under diagnosed in the US, we will compare the demographics and health characteristics of participants with a significant history of smoking (but no diagnosis of COPD) to participants with a COPD diagnosis. In addition, we will examine the medication data in the EHR for comparison with the published guidelines for treatment of both of these diseases.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate a higher frequency of asthma in women compared men but that men are more likely to have reported that asthma started in childhood. In addition, we anticipate a higher frequency of asthma and less medication use in African-Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. Since COPD is mainly due to cigarette smoking, we anticipate that participants with a diagnosis of COPD are more likely to be men of middle to older age with a significant history of tobacco exposure. In addition, we expect that a proportion of participants with a significant history of smoking will not have a diagnosis of COPD either by EHR or survey but may report symptoms of airways disease. Also, the degree of misclassification of the two diseases will be determined; for example, a young adult with a limited degree of tobacco exposure diagnosed as COPD is more likely to have asthma. In both diseases, we expect an increase frequency of common comorbidities including increased BMI.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The specific scientific question I intend to study is: ""What is the association between air pollution and the incidence of lung cancer?"" This question is of paramount importance due to the increasing global burden of lung cancer and the growing evidence that air pollution plays a significant role in the etiology of respiratory diseases, including lung cancer. Understanding this association is critical for several reasons:
Public Health Impact: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Identifying and quantifying the role of air pollution in lung cancer development could lead to targeted public health interventions, policies for air quality improvement, and ultimately, a reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cancer)","Scientific Approaches
Datasets:
Air Quality Data: Sources could include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) database.
Health Outcomes Data: Acquire lung cancer incidence and mortality data from cancer registries. This data will include information on lung cancer cases, demographic variables (age, sex), and geographic location.
Covariate Data: Collect data on potential confounders and effect modifiers, including smoking rates, socio-economic status, and occupational exposures
Research Methods:
Exposure Assessment: Use  models to estimate individual or community-level exposure to air pollutants based on residential or workplace locations.
Epidemiological Analysis: Conduct observational studies, such as cohort or case-control studies, to assess the relationship between air pollution exposure and lung cancer risk. This will involve calculating relative risks, odds ratios, and attributable risks, adjusting for confounders.","Anticipated Findings
The study aims to identify a quantitative relationship between long-term exposure to specific air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2) and the incidence of lung cancer. Findings are expected to highlight the risk increase associated with certain levels of exposure.
Through spatial analysis, the research may uncover geographic patterns in the correlation between air pollution levels and lung cancer rates, identifying areas with elevated risks.
Public Health Policies: The findings will provide robust evidence to support the development of targeted public health policies and air quality standards aimed at reducing lung cancer incidence. This evidence can advocate for stricter air pollution controls and inform guidelines for safe exposure levels.
Environmental Justice: Identifying spatial hotspots and differential risks can contribute to the discourse on environmental justice, highlighting communities disproportionately affected by air pollution and prompting targeted interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or stillbirth, is defined in the US as death ≥20 weeks gestation and occurs in about 1 in 160 pregnancies (CDC). Numerous medical risk factors have been identified as contributing to stillbirth, as have several social determinants, such as race, income, education, access to antenatal cate, air pollution, and drug use.  There is a paucity of literature examining the association of social determinants of health on IUFD as well as the impact social determinants of health have on stillbirth evaluation. Previous literature has shown placental pathology, fetal autopsy, and genetic testing identified as the most useful in determining stillbirth cause. However, little data analyzing whether socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are receiving these recommended evaluations exists.

We will match All of US participants' location with spatial-temporal datasets containing air pollution, extreme heat and temperature exposure and link diseases incidence and mortality EMR datasets in All of US database. Epidemiological analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of air pollution and climate change on cardiometabolic health incidence and mortality. We will additional explore using Fitbit data as an indicator of the individual behavior and test whether it can be used as an indicator of climate adaptation. Lastly, we will conduct statistical analysis testing genetic variant of cardiometabolic susceptibility during high air pollution period and/or during heatwave events.","Anticipated Findings
For the first aim, we anticipated that we found that air pollution and heat exposure is associated with higher incidence and mortality of the cardiometabolic diseases. For the second aim, we anticipated that we found increased physical activity could reduce adverse impact of air pollution and extreme heat exposure. For the third aim, we anticipated to replicate some of the previously identified genetic variants that are susceptible markers of the cardiometabolic diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 80 million people. The exact mechanisms of glaucoma development remain unclear, but oxidative stress, inflammatory pathways,  and microvascular changes have been shown to play an important role. The same mechanisms have been linked to air pollution and recent studies have shown that greater exposure of air pollutants are associated with both self-reported glaucoma and adverse structural characteristics of the disease. A better understanding of the association between glaucoma and air pollution, can help identify modifiable risk factors and, hopefully, provide actionable advice for patients and health care professionals to improve glaucoma management.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (glaucoma)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct an epidemiological study. To reflect chronic exposure, we will assess data from participants who have responded to The Basics survey question “How many years have you lived at your current address?” with either “6 to 10” or “11 to 20 or “more 20”. Cases of glaucoma will be identified using SNOMED-CT. To assess exposure of air pollutants, we will use publicly available government sources obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). We will match to the nearest location of measurement for each environmental variable to assign each patient a single set of environmental measurements. We will use logistic regression models to quantify the association of environmental variables with our primary outcome of glaucoma.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to obtain novel insights to increase our understanding of the relationship between greater exposure to air pollutants, and other environmental factors, and the risk of glaucoma.

The world has witnessed on-going urbanization and globalization for decades.  Currently, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and the proportion is expected to go up to about 66% by 2050.  The number of people living outside their country of origin has also been increasing over the last two decades.   This global trend is evident in largest cities in the world such as New York, suggesting rapid and extensive admixture of individuals with different ancestry inside the city. This admixture is different from the admixture we experienced before in many points. Thus, it is important to understand what would happen in our genome in the city from the perspective of population genetics.
Additionally, the environment in urban area is very unique: E.g. high density of people, heavy traffic, heavy air pollution, low level of physical activity and etc. These unique environment can drive evolution though gene environment interaction.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To assess what genetic features in cities are different from those in rural areas,  we will categorize All Of US participants by the level of urbanization based on zip code data and compare several statistics (e.g. genetic diversity). To understand what is happening in a large city, we will analyze population structure in New York City by PCA, ADMIXTURE, UMAP and IBD sharing network and compare with New York States. We will also infer local ancestry for each individual using MOSAIC and gnomix to compare ancestry composition in each individual's genome.","Anticipated Findings
By analyzing NYC participants, we will find several founder populations and many recently admixed individuals. By combining EHR data, we will be able to find population-specific disease and associated variants. This may improve our understanding of disease background for underrepresented populations such as admixed populations and small founder populations.
Higher genetic diversity and higher rate of assortative mating are anticipated in the city than rural area. Our findings may be helpful to create future frameworks of genomic study such as Genome-wide association study (GWAS) because some genetic features like assortative mating would contradict the assumption of current framework.
Inferring local ancestry is important for finding disease-associated variants in admixed individuals. We will provide the results to other researchers to enhance genetic researches in admixed populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are interested generally in risk factors for developing autoimmune diseases, in particular but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, at the population level. We are interested in environmental risk factors (air pollution, heat, pesticides, etc.), psychosocial factors (stress, emotional distress, trauma, PTSD, depression, resilience), social determinants of health (access to food, work, housing, neighborhood factors) , and behavioral lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, exercise, obesity, diet, work hours, etc.). We are interested in characterizing the sociodemographics of the populations affected and estimating the population attributable risk for each of these factors and in combinations.  When genome-wide data are available, we will be interested in genetic risk factors for autoimmune diseases, and how they may interact with environmental risk factors to produce immune dysregulation and then disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Health disparities exist widely in the breast cancer outcomes (incidence, survival, and quality-of-life). When compared with white women, African American women have higher recurrence and death rates from breast cancer although they have a lower incidence rate. It is well established that both community and individual level risk factors play important roles in the breast cancer outcomes.
We will take advantage of the comprehensive database collected by the All of Us project to investigate the observed racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes. Using the novel multilevel mediation analysis method, we will identify modifiable factors that can explain the racial disparities observed in breast cancer outcomes. The risk factors to be considered include measures at both the environmental (e.g. pollution measurements) and individual levels (e.g., smoking behavior and gene expressions).","Project Purpose(s)

We will identify important genes and investigate their relative contribution in breast cancer progression to determine how the neighborhood environment interacts with gene expressions, leading to their alteration in different racial groups and thus influencing associated racial health disparities. All female participants who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will be included for analysis. We will also entail cross-sectional data analysis of multilevel data, nesting individual gene expression data in neighborhoods, to analyze the competing risks of the neighborhood environment for breast cancer. As described in the AoU data dictionary, participants’ residential addresses were geo-coded and the socio-economic status of the residential address are linked to patients according to the zip codes.  We have generated neighborhood risk factors from public-available datasets and will link the neighborhood risk factors with each participant. We will use the mediation analysis method.","Anticipated Findings

Many women experience a worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors (such as blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body fat quantity/localization) around midlife. The menopausal transition, and its associated hormonal changes, may contribute to some of this increased cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk. Each individual woman can react differently to menopause, and studies by SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) and others have shown that different women experience different trajectories of hormonal and cardiometabolic changes around the time of the final menstrual period.
I would like to identify genetic and other factors that are associated with cardiometabolic risk factor trajectories in midlife women. This could help to better understand how menopause impacts cardiometabolic health and could help to predict how individual women may respond to menopause and perhaps help to tailor lifestyle interventions, treatments, etc. to each woman (precision medicine).","Project Purpose(s)

The first step will be to extract the timing of the final menstrual period (FMP) from the dataset, if available, for each woman participant.

Then, women will be categorized based on the trajectory of each cardiometabolic trait around the time of menopause. Finally, we will search for genetic and covariate associations with each trajectory category.","Anticipated Findings
If successful, this study could take a step towards understanding how and why different women react differently to menopause, in terms of their cardiometabolic health. This could help to identify women who may be likely to experience particular cardiometabolic risk factor trajectories before they even enter the menopausal transition, potentially allowing for early intervention and more effective prevention of disease.

Research Question: Is there a significant association between race/ethnicity, allostatic load, perceived stress, social determinants of health, and cardiovascular disease outcomes among breast cancer survivors?
Racial disparities persist in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive research and intervention strategies. Examining stress and allostatic load is crucial in understanding and addressing these disparities. Chronic stress and allostatic load, which encompasses the cumulative physiological toll of stress on the body, have been linked to both CVD and breast cancer outcomes. Moreover, racial and ethnic minorities often face disproportionate levels of stress due to social determinants of health, including systemic racism, socioeconomic disadvantage, and limited access to quality healthcare. These stressors can contribute to the development and progression of both diseases and exacerbate existing health disparities.","Project Purpose(s)

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concerns. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities.","Project Purpose(s)

This work was reviewed and overseen by the All of Us Research Program Science Committee and the All of Us Data and Research Center to ensure compliance with program policy, including acceptable data access and use. )","Scientific Approaches
In this project, we plan on using the AHA algorithm/equation to calculate the cardiovascular risk scores ( https://ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.0000437741.48606.98). Further, we want to demonstrate the usage of smoking and race data collected by the program, which are data that usually researchers use natural language processing to extract, to facilitate the calculation of cardiovascular risk score.
We will calculate the scores using 1- Data manipulation: Using python and BigQuery to: A- Retrieve medications (diabetes), lab measurements including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, race, and smoking information provided by participants  2- Visualization: A- Creating histogram for calculated scores using python visualization library Matplotlib","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate demonstrating the validity and importance of the data collected by the program and can be challenging to extract from medical records (smoking status) by showing by calculating the cardiovascular risk within 10 years. We expect to find: 1) the easiness in using data from different sources (EHR and survey data) to build a model or calculate a risk. 2) the heterogeneity in All of Us population where underrepresented population in clinical trials or clinical data set are more present in the All of Us  3) the cardiovascular risk score is different in racial groups.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers. In response to FNIH RFP2 “GENERATION of New genetic, -omic, or biomarker data for Common Metabolic Diseases,” we propose to generate and discover novel genetic associations in the All of Us Research Program.","Project Purpose(s)

We will perform disease, disease-related trait, and covariate harmonization in the All of Us Cohort for diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease outcomes and hypertension), disease-related traits (glycemic traits, CVD risk factors, blood pressure), and important covariates (adiposity traits, smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). We will report counts and power calculations that describe the genetic associations that could be discovered in the All of Us Cohort. We will explore the availability of additional common metabolic diseases and complications and perform power calculations for these traits. We will perform genetic association analyses with each disease and outcome (type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and NAFLD).","Anticipated Findings

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition consisting of lifelong elevated LDL cholesterol levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Variants in three genes involved in LDL receptor function, LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, account for most cases. Among Western populations, the prevalence of FH has been reported to be between 1:212 to 1:331.  African ancestry individuals are underrepresented in submissions to genetic resources used to determine variant pathogenicity and there are no known reports on the prevalence of FH in those populations. Therefore, the study aims to create an African ancestry cohort to assess frequency of FH variants and outcomes such as LDL levels, use of lipid-lowering medications, and ASCVD risk among individuals in this cohort to better understand the burden of FH in this population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (familial hypercholesterolemia)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We plan to run ADMIXTURE on  genetic data from  All of Us  and other large multi-ethnic cohorts to create an African ancestry cohort. We then will assess sequence variants in the three FH genes from this cohort for pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Finally we will compare outcomes such as lipid levels , use of lipid lowering medications, and ASCVD risk  among those with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, a VUS, and without any such variant.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate finding several variants in the three known FH genes that are rare and/or poorly characterized in primarily European ancestry cohorts that confer increased risk for high LDL levels and ASCVD risk. We expect that many of the individuals with these variants will have not been adequately screened and treated for FH, and thus represent a population that could see benefits in care and lifespan with increased testing for FH variants and LDL cholesterol levels earlier in life.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In recent years, the biomedical research community has become more aware of the potential influence that a set of non-medical factors have on health outcomes (Marmot et al. 2008). Such social determinants of health (SDOH) are comprised of the conditions in which people work and live, including income, education, food security, early childhood development, social inclusion, etc. Recently, an association was observed between SDOH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients (Vinter et al. 2022). However, whether the link between SDOH and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is causal and, in which direction, remains to be seen. This study is important because a statistical correlation between two variables can be explained by multiple underlying causal networks and knowledge of the causal network can help focus research and healthcare delivery.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease(s))
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will develop a list of confounders, SDOH exposures of interest and outcomes of adverse cardiovascular conditions / events, based on a literature review and evaluation of the data available to us. We will formulate these into a series of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) per exposure-outcome model.
We will begin transforming and building our analytic dataset. We will make use of the various tools AllOfUs provides via Workbench platform. These tools include: Workspaces, R and Python, Dataset Builders and Cohort Builders.
We will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA).
We will then calculate propensity score models and employ inverse probability weighting (IPW) to weight regression models. Doubly robust methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) can be explored. Alternative to TMLE, a factor analysis can be performed on various SDOH and demographic survey measures available. These aggregate factors could then be utilized as exposures in our IPW regression models.","Anticipated Findings
Ideally, this study will answer the following question: What is the strength and direction of the causal relationship between multiple SDOH exposures and adverse cardiovascular outcomes? Currently, many SDOH exposures are associated with a variety of poor medical outcomes. We expect our models to show that some SDOH exposures do not causally influence adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and that other factors do have a causal influence and to what magnitude. Knowledge of the underlying causal structure can help focus public policy and healthcare delivery on SDOH factors that really matter to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease(s).","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to investigate and compare the contribution of cardiovascular disease risk factors on CVD outcomes among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that premenopausal women who are non-diabetic are protected against CVD in comparison to age-matched males. But the differences attenuated among post-menopausal women who were not on hormone replacement therapy. Menopause is associated with high blood pressure, high BMI, dyslipidemia and cholesterol accumulation and also associated with decrease in estrogen indicating that menopause and hormone status can account for the observed sex-differences. Here, we will explore the age-related differences in contributions of CVD risk factors among women. This will inform and support clinicians, scientist and public health professionals on clinically meaningful age-related differences and create awareness for prevention of CVD.","Project Purpose(s)

The participants will be analyzed across all races, ethnicities and geographical regions and education and income level. The data will be checked for normality; descriptive characteristics and associations will be summarized. A univariate regression analysis and risk ratio between each risk factor and CVD outcome will be performed.

This research aims to elucidate the genetic etiology of obesity. Specifically, we intend to assess the relationship between certain genetic variants and the incidence of obesity, as well as how these genetic factors interact with environmental and lifestyle factors to influence individual body weight.
Obesity is a major global health challenge, associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of obesity will advance our knowledge of how to better predict, prevent, and treat this condition. It will also contribute to the development of personalized medicine and public health interventions that could ameliorate the impact of obesity on society.","Project Purpose(s)

Treatment outcomes for cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are disproportionally poorer among racial and ethnic
minority patients. Black/African American (BAA) hypertension patients are less likely to have their blood pressure
controlled as compared to non-Hispanic White (nHW) patients. Nonadherence to the medications used for
treating CMDs is one of the major reasons for these observed disparities because optimal adherence to CMD
medications (antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic) is associated with 20-38% lower risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. BAAs, compared with non-Hispanic Whites (nHWs), are 37-80% less likely to
fully adhere with these CMD medications. The public health and economic burden of nonadherence to CMD
medications is steep. Thus, nonadherence is a major determinant of the disproportionately high burden of CVDs
among racial and ethnic minority populations in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of hypertension in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one hypertension medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated systolic or elevated diastolic blood pressure on measurements 2 and 3 from PPI.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for essential hypertension from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings
The prevalence of hypertension in the All of Us cohort is similar to that of published literature. All of Us age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% compared to 29.6% in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The All of Us cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data that can be utilized to study hypertension nationwide. The prevalence of hypertension varies in the United States (U.S.) by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Hypertension can often be treated successfully with medication, and prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications. Even with these established hypertension intervention and prevention strategies, the prevalence of hypertension continues to be at levels of public health concern. The diversity within All of Us may provide insight into factors relevant to hypertension prevention and treatments in a variety of social and geographic contexts and population strata in the U.S.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in  patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our study aims to address several key questions related to the interplay of genetic and environmental
factors in the development of CVDs in patients with SLE and RA. Specifically, we seek to investigate:
(1) The role of genetic variation in the susceptibility of SLE and RA patients to CVDs.
(2) How environmental factors, such as lifestyle choices and comorbidities, interact with genetic
predispositions to impact CVD risk in SLE and RA cohorts.
(3) Whether there exist shared genetic and environmental risk factors between SLE and RA
contributing to CVD development, or if distinct mechanisms underpin CVD pathogenesis in each
condition.","Project Purpose(s)

To address our research questions, we will employ a multifaceted approach integrating genetic
analyses, multivariate statistical methods, and clinical assessments. Our methodologies will include:
(1) Statistical analyses to identify genetic variants and environmental factors, such as smoking, diet,
physical activity, and medication usage, associated with CVD risk in SLE and RA cohorts.
(2) Integration of genetic and environmental data through statistical modeling and bioinformatic
analyses to elucidate gene-environment interactions underlying CVD susceptibility in SLE and RA
populations.
(3) Analyses of clinical profiles of SLE and RA patients with and without CVDs to delineate disease-specific
and shared risk factors.","Anticipated Findings

Statins are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications that significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk patients. However, medication nonadherence, often attributed to reported side effects such as muscle pain, remains a significant barrier to their effectiveness. Genetic variations in the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene, responsible for encoding organic anion transporter polypeptide 1b1 (OATP1B1) and facilitating statin uptake into tissues, may impact statin efficacy and safety. Decreased statin concentrations can lead to reduced effectiveness in lowering LDL-C levels, while increased systemic exposure increases the risk of muscle-related symptoms. This study seeks to assess the influence of the rs4149056 (SLCO1B1*5) genotype on statin switching, discontinuation, and the incidence of clinical events such as myopathy and major adverse cardiovascular events.","Project Purpose(s)

Utilizing real-world evidence to better understand the interplay between statin therapy and the SLCO1B1*5 variant represents an advancement in personalized medicine.

The study aims to investigate the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications in the United States. Due to the ever-changing trend in the management of diabetes, the contemporary safety and effectiveness of different approaches to diabetes become big concern. The approval of different classes of medications including Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, peptidase inhibitors (DPP4 inhibitors), and sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) pose uncertainty in outcomes and safety of these medications for CKD and DM. This study will explore the glycemic control, cardiovascular and renal outcomes of these medications, and their adverse health outcomes relative to the main stay therapy such as metformin and insulin. The main safety concerns include diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, cancer, and metabolic abnormalities. The study will also use predictive tools such as machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes in diabetes patients such as Uncontrolled Diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To determine the safety and effectiveness, a cohort of patients who are taking anti-diabetes medications will be selected. The patients will be followed starting from the date of medication initiation till the current time. The incidence of different adverse effects and the status of patients will be recorded along with the types of medications. The specific events include glucose level, cardiovascular events, mortality, adverse renal outcomes, and adverse drug reactions such as diabetes ketoacidosis, infections, and cancer. Comparison will be made between groups who are taking different medications to determine the relative safety and effectiveness of the medications. We will implement different statistical and computational algorithms to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications. particularly, the level of glycemic control will be predicted using machine learning approach.","Anticipated Findings
The assessment of the safety and effectiveness of anti-diabetes medications would help to select the appropriate therapy for diabetes patients. In addition, it will help to maximize the quality of life of patients and decrease the cost of treatment. The adverse effects of the medications would be early detected and prevented. Further to this, the macro-and microvascular complications of diabetes would be reduced.

Up to 1 in 12 people worldwide is estimated to suffer from hearing loss, with 38 million Americans among them. Currently approved therapy for hearing loss in all its varieties is limited to sound amplification or surgical implants for those with more severe hearing loss. The effect of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockade, a target of anti-hypertensive medications, in human hearing loss has not been extensively explored. Age related hearing loss, or presbycusis, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, with hypertension serving as a predictor of faster rates of hearing decline. RAS-targeted treatments have the potential for system-wide vasoprotective effects and thus preserve hearing. To establish the RAS as a therapeutic target, we propose to examine the effect angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on development and progression of hearing loss using the AllofUs patient database.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Explore for an association of treatment with RAS-blockers and rates of hearing loss diagnoses among all patients who underwent treatment with anti-hypertensive medications. This query will compare two groups with otherwise similar baseline characteristics: 1) patients with a hypertension diagnosis who underwent pharmacotherapy for the treatment of hypertension with one or more of several common medication classes (diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers), versus 2) patients with hypertension who underwent treatment with ACEis or ARBs. These groups will be assessed for differences in the frequency of diagnostic codes for hearing loss (e.g. ICD 9 code 389.1 and 389.2), levels of hearing loss defined by audiometry (mild, moderate, severe, or profound), and for frequency of cochlear implantation (e.g. ICD 9 codes 20.96 to 20.98).","Anticipated Findings
We expect these comparisons to provide important information regarding the protective benefits of agents targeting the classical RAS as a novel otoprotective approach. These studies will have a positive impact and clinical relevance since they will inform future animal studies and human clinical trials regarding the use of existing, well-established medications for a novel indication of the prevention and treatment of hearing loss. They may also provide more substantial evidence of the benefit of these established pharmacologic strategies in treating other common microvascular and macrovascular diseases. Additionally, they may spur further investigation into novel therapies targeting the protective axis within the RAS (e.g. ACE2 activators, Ang-(1-7) or AT2R agonists). This is consistent with our long-term goal to aid in the translation of research of the ear’s endogenous protective systems into bedside therapeutics for patients at risk of hearing loss.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment. As predicting treatment response is complex and involves multiple different factors, the All of Us cohort provides a unique opportunity to study all these factors and use them to create a ML algorithm.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I plan on exploring the All of Us dataset to identify the number of participants taking antipsychotics, and the ways in which drug response can be defined for them. It will be important to have long-term response data for the participants. Once a cohort has been created, I will analyze it using machine learning tools such as support vector machines and random forest, which are supervised machine learning methods. Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In this workspace, based on our results generated from French participants, we aim to confirm associations between rare, loss-of-function or gain-of-function DNA variants and the risk of metabolic disorders (or the level of associated traits) using All of Us. The rare variants will be located either i/ in coding exons from candidate genes involved in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or in associated traits, or ii/ in non-coding genomic loci. To assess the functional effect of DNA variants we will either use in silico and/or in vitro studies. This project should lead to the identification or confirmation of functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the following datasets: whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA arrays
For WES and WGS, the analysis will be focused on rare variants in specific loci  (specific genes or specific non coding regions).or interest. DNA arrayswill be used for the calculation of genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for metabolic disorders or traits.
Genetic association analyses will be done between genetic markers (rare variants and/or PRS) and metabolic traits, when adjusting for relevant covariates (including sex, age, ancestry for instance).
Of note, to refine the analyses, we will use a functional genetic approach focusing on rare variants found in All of Us. For these in vitro studies, we have notably developed genome editing (i.e. CRISPR/cas9) in several human cell lines, which enables the functional analyses of small genomic regions (like an entire enhancer) or even of a single point mutation.","Anticipated Findings
This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups. We will explore to what extent there is a shared genetic basis for the cooccurrence of heart and brain disease, and whether this persists across ancestries.","Project Purpose(s)

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are responsible for a substantial proportion of the morbidity and mortality observed in the general population. Mounting evidence indicates that this impact disproportionately affects minority populations. Most factors underlying these health disparities pertain to the social determinants of health, but it is unclear how biological factors play a role or interact with these social determinants. The main questions of this study are: (1) can we use All of US to identify novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are specific to a given minority group? (2) Are existing risk factors for CVD shared across all minority groups? (3) Can we disentangle the contributions of social determinants of health and biological factors contributing to cardiovascular disease?

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment. As predicting treatment response is complex and involves multiple different factors, the All of Us cohort provides a unique opportunity to study all these factors and use them to create a ML algorithm.","Project Purpose(s)

Other Purpose (I will be using genetic, lifestyle and clinical data from participants taking antipsychotics to develop a machine learning algorithm that can combine the effects of these factors to predict drug response and side effects)","Scientific Approaches
I plan on exploring the All of Us dataset to identify the number of participants taking antipsychotics, and the ways in which drug response can be defined for them.  It will be important to have long-term response data for the participants. Once a cohort has been created, I will analyze it using machine learning tools such as support vector machines and random forest, which are supervised machine learning methods. Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We wish to investigate what are there are genetic determinants or risk factors of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is a common infertility disorder affecting approximately 8-13% of women who are of reproductive-age. While common, PCOS is also a complex and multifactorial disease without a clear genetic cause. PCOS overlaps with other diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndromes. It is not clear if these associated diseases are caused by or are consequences of PCOS, or if PCOS and these other disease collectively have a common cause. In addition, women with PCOS have negative body image perceptions, low self-esteem, depression, and decreased quality of life. There is a need to increase knowledge surrounding the risk factors and determinants of PCOS to improve risk identification, disease diagnosis, and disease treatment and management options.","Project Purpose(s)

In order to determine what genetic risk factors are contributing to PCOS, we plan to explore genetic variants in women with PCOS to women without PCOS.

We will explore PCOS correlations in different cohort groups such as age, genetic ancestry, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, geography, if applicable. We will also look at correlations of the genetics between PCOS and other diseases starting with known associated diseases such like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. We plan to create summary statistics and graphical visualizations of our results to include in research presentations and peer-reviewed research articles.","Anticipated Findings

This study will primarily investigate whether a multidimensional whole health index, integrating measures of physical, mental, social, environmental, and financial well-being, offers a more robust prediction of chronic disease risk – including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers – within the ""All of Us"" cohort compared to traditional risk models that often rely heavily on clinical factors. Additionally, the research will explore if and how disparities across demographic groups (age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) are reflected in variations in these whole health metrics and whether these variations potentially explain differences in chronic disease burden.   A successful outcome could enhance chronic disease prediction capabilities, empowering healthcare providers with more accurate tools for early intervention and personalized prevention strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
My research methods will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation matrices to gain a comprehensive understanding of data distributions and relationships among variables.  Operationalizing whole health domains into quantifiable metrics will be crucial (for example, using survey scores validated for mental health assessment ). Factor analysis will be employed to reduce dimensionality within the dataset. Regression analysis will then determine the relationships between the whole health index and chronic disease outcomes while controlling for confounding factors. Finally, I'll leverage machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks, to enhance predictive capabilities, identify key features, and effectively model complex interactions","Anticipated Findings
The overarching hypothesis is that the multidimensional whole health index will significantly outperform traditional risk models for chronic disease prediction. Additionally, it's anticipated that certain whole health domains might emerge as particularly strong predictors for specific chronic diseases (e.g., the role of social isolation in cardiovascular health). Crucially, the study aims to unveil how variations in whole health metrics align with patterns of chronic disease distribution across demographic groups, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms driving health disparities. These findings have the potential to revolutionize how we approach chronic disease risk assessment, going beyond isolated risk factors to a more holistic and personalized framework. The identified key whole health metrics will pinpoint crucial areas for targeted interventions at both the individual and population health level.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The association between participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and improved cardiovascular outcomes, including reductions in recurrent cardiovascular events, readmissions, mortality, and depression and anxiety is well described. Previous studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic differences in CR participation, as well as the influence of socioeconomic factors on differences in participation in CR between racial and ethnic groups. Few studies have explored racial differences in CR outcomes, as well as the impact of other social factors, including household composition, primary language, health literacy, and employment status, on CR participation. Identifying these factors can allow for the timely and targeted development of interventions to increase initiation of CR, especially among minority populations, and improve long term outcomes of cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

I plan to perform a retrospective cohort study on adults ≥18 years with first time CR-qualifying diagnoses per ICD coding, with qualifying individuals grouped into CR initiation and non-initiation groups.

A logistic regression model will also be constructed to to predict CR initiation as a function of variables including race, copayment, primary language, household composition, and employment status.","Anticipated Findings
Given that participation in CR has been historically and significantly lower in Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations compared to White individuals, further exploration into the socioeconomic factors that influence racial differences in utilization of CR services and their possible ramifications on long-term mortality and other clinical endpoints is urgently warranted.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Objective: To investigate whether neighborhood-level measures of socioeconomic status, built environment, social cohesion, and access to resources are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse cardiovascular outcomes among pregnant women.
Data Sources: We will leverage multiple data sources from the All of Us research program:
Participant surveys, Electronic health records, Census and administrative data linked at the census tract level
Outcomes: Primary - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia)
Secondary - Peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, stroke, myocardial infarction
Analysis Plan: We will use multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations between quartiles of neighborhood-level variables and cardiovascular outcomes, adjusting for individual confounders. Interaction terms will assess effect modification by individual-level socioeconomic status.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular system disease)","Scientific Approaches
Descriptive Analysis: We will examine the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors, conditions, and outcomes among pregnant women in the cohort using summary statistics. These will include body mass index, chronic hypertension, diabetes, smoking, insurance status and others.
Outcomes: The primary outcome will be hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes are peripartum cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, stroke, and myocardial infarction.
Main Analysis: We will fit logistic regression models to estimate the associations between neighborhood-level economic, social, and environmental exposures (independent variables) and cardiovascular outcomes (dependent variables), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity and other relevant confounders. Effect modification by individual SES will be assessed.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show treatment patterns using data and electronic health records from different sites across the country. We expect to find (1) variation in the medication sequences prescribed to treat All of Us participants who have type 2 diabetes and hypertension; (2) the most common medication used to treat participants as the first line therapy for type 2 diabetes and hypertension; (3) a trend or change over time in what is/are the most common medication(s) prescribed first over the study period; and (4) trend or change overtime for the percentage of participants who were treated using only one medication class (monotherapy). Importantly, the detailed code developed will be made available within the Researcher Workbench, so other researchers may more easily extract medication data and class information using a common medication ontology.

Are there specific genetic variants associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients with diabetes?
What is the prevalence of cardiovascular genetic risk factors among the diabetic Hispanic population?
Studying genetic variations linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes individuals, especially in the Hispanic community, is essential for progressing personalize care and improving health outcomes. Identifying distinct genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is the first step in developing personalized prevention and treatment approaches, especially in minority groups like US Hispanics. Further, a better understanding genetic predisposition may improve our biological understanding of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and facilitate specific therapies to lessen the burden of cardiovascular problems in this at-risk population.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Cohort selection: Create cohort of diabetic patients in the All of Us program. We will then identify patients who develop the outcome of interest (the presence of cardiovascular disease [CVD]).  Data collection: Data will be collected from the All of Us database. The data should include demographic details, clinical parameters, individuals' genetics and outcomes related to diabetes and CVD.
Generating Descriptive statistics of the population:
Statistical Analysis: The use of statistical software (eg. Python) to generate descriptive statistics for the diabetes cohort. It will include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
Candidate gene study to identify if candidate SNPs (rs6923761, rs57922, rs9299870) are associated with risk of CVD in diabetes patients. This will involve the association of these SNPs within cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings: Specific genetic variations, interacting with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling system, provide a complex risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We anticipate that genetic variations in the GLP-1 signaling system may impact the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists by affecting insulin production, glucose metabolism, and atherosclerosis as well as overall cardiovascular risk. The study's findings are anticipated to improve our comprehension of why specific diabetes patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and how their reaction to therapy can differ depending on genetic factors. This method not only seeks to enhance scientific understanding but also strives to tackle healthcare inequalities and enhance public health results by customizing interventions to suit the unique requirements of individual patients, according to their genetic makeup.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is crucial for effective intervention and personalized medicine. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged as a promising tool for identifying individuals at high risk of developing CVD and other complex diseases. However, challenges exist in the utilization of PRS. Most PRS studies primarily focus on common variants, overlooking the potential contributions of rare variants, especially in intron and regulatory regions. Moreover, the portability of PRS to other ancestral populations, beyond European descent, is limited. To tackle these challenges this study will explore the impact of rare variants in the exon, intron and regulatory regions and its addition to PRS.

Gout is an inflammatory metabolic disease affecting > 4% of US adults, including > 9% of those over age 65.  People with gout can experience very painful and disabling attacks (flares) in their joints and are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.
Gout results from high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricaemia) and studies by our group and others have identified many environmental, clinical, and genetic factors associated with gout. These include diuretic medications (increased risk), and coffee and vitamin C (decreased risk).  However, despite evidence that gout is having a greater impact on men and women in non-White racial groups in the US, most factors were identified in people of self-reported White race.
To address these gaps, we are exploring the AllofUs data to plan future studies on the environmental, genetic, and clinical factors associated with gout (or worse gout outcomes) in women and men of different racial/ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate using logistic regression models to evaluate the association between exposures and the risk of gout or hyperuricemia, adjusting for well-established gout risk factors such as overweight/obesity and use of diuretic medications.  We will also assess for joint effects and interactions between exposures, including genetic exposures drawn from the Genomics dataset.  For example, our prior analysis of a different cohort of mainly White adults found that excess BMI can exacerbate the impact of carrying certain hyperuricemia genes on the risk of gout.  Mediation analysis will be performed to quantify factors influencing sex- or racial differences in the burden of gout.","Anticipated Findings

We aim to assess metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity among minoritized groups and if patterns of severity are different between sub-groups, to derive separate severity scores by group. We will further assess roles of SDOH in worsening severity between groups and evaluate long-term risk prediction for future CVD—all with the goal of providing detailed guidance for researchers and healthcare providers for CVD preventative care.
To these ends, we aim to answer the following questions:
-	Are there differences in MetS manifestation among marginalized groups?
-	If there are differences, how do severity scores derived within a group compare to those previously derived?
-	What are the relationships between MetS severity and SDOH?
-	Are there differences in CVD or T2D outcomes longitudinally by group?","Project Purpose(s)

Using the Controlled level v7 data to access EHR data from each participant, we will use confirmatory factor analysis of MetS components among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender sub-groups and assess how these differ from prior estimates, deriving group-specific MetS z-scores. Sub-groups will be assessed for differences in correlations between SDOH data and MetS severity. Finally, we will assess CVD and T2D, including new diagnosis and mortality relative to MetS z-scores at multiple time points.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that MetS manifests differently among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender subgroups, warranting derivation of separate MetS-Z scores to guide identification and treatment for MetS-related risk. We further hypothesize that a large portion of this risk is related to SDOH burden in minoritized groups. In all sub-groups, we expect that higher scores will predict new disease outcomes. Deriving MetS-Z scores for each sub-group would enable more specific clinical assessment of future disease risk by sub-group. Identification of relationships between MetS severity, SDOH, and CVD outcomes would highlight the medical harm of experienced discrimination and could help in risk stratification for groups not normally seen as having elevated CVD risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Type 2 diabetes is linked to a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular complications. To minimize the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events, it is important to closely regulate blood sugar levels through different glycemic control treatments.

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the industrialized nations. Countries with emerging economies are also facing increasing burden of cardiovascular disease . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) shares many common traditional risk factors with CVD.  These risk factors are growing in the community along with increasing burden of CVD and CKD.
Several predictive models are in clinical practice to stratify cardiovascular risk in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple studies suggest chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes and increased rate of cardiovascular events. However, there is a lack of consensus in using renal impairment as one of the predictor variables in assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with CVD. We propose to develop a comprehensive model incorporating renal function as one of the predictor variables which may improve the predictive accuracy of existing cardiovascular risk prediction models.","Project Purpose(s)

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, affecting an estimated 75 million people. This number is expected to increase to 110 million by the year 2040. Both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the two most common forms of glaucoma, disproportionately affect racial minorities in comparison to Whites in the United States. Allostatic load is a measurement that draws upon multiple bodily systems (cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, neuroendocrine) to estimate a person’s physiologic stress and allostatic coping mechanisms. Drivers of allostatic load include any chronic stressors, such as occupational stress, social isolation, and racial discrimination. Prior studies have linked other systemic diseases to allostatic load, but specific association between allostatic load and glaucoma has only been inferred.

The objectives of this study are to assess trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) and trajectories of physical activity separately among sexual and gender minorities (SGM) of color, heterosexuals of color, in comparison to White sexual and gender minorities, as well as White heterosexuals.
A secondary aim of this study is to assess how trajectories of physical activity are associated with changes in HRV among SGM and heterosexuals of color. SGM are shown to have higher rates of harmful cardiometabolic health behaviors when compared to cisgender heterosexuals.
The final aim of this study is to cross-sectionally investigate if physical activity mediates the association between discrimination and HRV among SGM and heterosexuals. Exposure to discrimination may lead to increased cardiovascular risk through behavioral and physiological pathways such as unhealthy coping behaviors or blunted diurnal cortisol slopes.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The present study plans to utilize most of the data available through All of Us which contains electronic health records, biological specimen measurements, and Fitbit measurements. This also includes demographic characteristics of participants such as age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race. Survey measurement data will also be included such as depressive symptoms, and discrimination. Covariates of cardiovascular disease will also be investigated such as familial history of a heart disease, tobacco use, alcohol use frequency, and other substance use. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured through the Fitbit data available and will be treated appropriately with established methods. HRV will be explored through multiple measures such as resting heart rate (interbeat interval), differences between heartbeats, low-frequency (LF) power, and high-frequency (HF) power.
Researchers will investigate trajectories with a longitudinal perspective.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that SGM of color will have faster decreasing trajectories of HRV and physical activity compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Additionally, we predict that decreasing trajectories of physical activity will be associated with poorer trajectories of cardiometabolic health, with associations pronounced for SGM of color compared to White SGM and heterosexuals of color. Lastly, we hypothesize that greater exposure to discrimination will be associated with decreased physical activity which results in lower HRV among SGM, especially those of color.
The findings of this study will contribute to the current emerging field of sexual and gender minority health. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and this effect is more pronounced for individuals in possession of a minority identity. Findings will provide an additional look into how discrimination affects CVD risk among racial and ethnic groups of SGM.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will evaluate the general epidemiology for e-cigarette use and we will study the relationships with other key variables having to do with life stressors of other lifestyle habits.  Besides, we will explore whether e-cig use can lead to cardiovascular health effects.
E-cigarette use has gained popularity, with the patterns of use changing rapidly, raising concerns about its potential health consequences. By studying the current epidemiology and investigating the relationship between e-cigarette use and other lifestyle traits, we can shed light on the overall health implications of e-cigarette use. Moreover, exploring the association between e-cigarette use and incident hypertension is critical due to the growing prevalence of both e-cigarette use and hypertension, particularly in young individuals. Understanding this potential link can guide public health policies, healthcare strategies, and health education efforts to mitigate hypertension-related risks among e-cigarette users.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the extensive All of Us dataset as our primary data source. With its diverse participant pool and comprehensive data on demographics and health-related variables, the dataset offers a robust foundation for our research. We intend to utilize relevant baseline variables, including e-cigarette use, lifestyle variables including psychological stressors, and baseline hypertension status. The analyses for our first aim will be cross-sectional, employing logistic regression and related methods. For the second aim, we will ascertain incident health status – specifically incident hypertension – from the data derived from linked EHR files. These analyses will employ Cox proportional hazards regression and related survival analysis techniques. Our team's multidisciplinary expertise equips us to conduct and oversee rigorous analysis. In addition to our primary research questions, we will broaden our analysis to encompass other health outcomes related to e-cigarette use.","Anticipated Findings
The study aims to explore plausible associations between e-cigarette use, and other lifestyle patterns including other tobacco use and illicit drug use, psychosocial stressors, and incident hypertension, leveraging the All of Us dataset. The anticipated outcomes may unveil correlations and associations between e-cigarette use and heightened psychosocial stress levels, coupled with an increased risk of developing hypertension. These findings could expand our current understanding of the health implications of e-cigarettes, potentially guiding proactive strategies and targeted interventions. The results have the potential to enhance scientific insights by untangling the intricate pathways linking e-cigarette use, psychosocial determinants, and the occurrence of hypertension. As a result, this contribution could inform evidence-driven approaches in public health, potentially stimulating further exploration within this rapidly evolving research domain.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1) What is the prevalence of different types of cardiovascular disease in people with cancer?
2) What types of cardiovascular disease are associated with specific types of cancer treatment?
3) Are there genetic variants associated with cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease?
These questions are important because the number of cancer survivors is projected to reach 30 million by 2030 and there are increased rates of cardiovascular disease in patients treated for cancer compared to patients who were not treated for cancer. Capability to identify which patients are at risk of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease would allow early intervention with cardioprotective strategies. If there is a genetic component to cancer therapy-related cardiovascular disease, genetic profiling could be used to 1) Identify at risk patients prior to treatment; 2) Better understand the the mechanism of toxicity, 3) Develop new cardioprotective drugs.","Project Purpose(s)

I intend to uncover genomic variants that are linked to cardiac shape measuerements. My primary purpose is to investigate quantitatively how changes in heart shape affect different patients' cardiovascular disease outcomes. Are these changes in heart shape also explained by genomic variants? Exploring these differences can aid in diagnosis and treatment of diffeerent cardiovascular disease phenotypes. For example, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients have markably different symptoms. A major difference in diagnosis can be due to a patient's underlying genetic makup of the heart. This connection is something we also hope to look into further.","Project Purpose(s)

We have a pipeline developed to take several different guide points and landmarks in MRIs to characterize heart shape. We use the basic measurements and then use dimensional reduction to get a set of normalized principal components for each patient. I will then use a sort of GWAS or some other association method to correlate the genomic variants and heart shape measurements.

The primary scientific inquiry we aim to investigate revolves around ascertaining whether the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents yields additional cardiovascular benefits in comparison to the inhibition of either target in isolation, particularly in high-risk patients.
This research question holds significant importance as prevailing guidelines advocate for a more intensive management approach for type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. However, a substantial number of these patients struggle to attain the recommended treatment targets, even with maximal therapy. By examining the combined effects on blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation through the inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents , as demonstrated in this study, we intend to establish a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of a combined inhibitor approach.","Project Purpose(s)

Dataset:
Utilize individual-level data from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD. Identify those at high risk who fail to achieve target blood glucose levels despite being on the maximum tolerated therapy for blood glucose reduction.
Methods:
Stratify participants based on genetic variants that are predictive of higher or lower levels. Subsequently, compare the rates of blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular events.
Analyses:
Utilize linear regression models to quantify the differences in blood glucose levels based on specific genotypes. Additionally, employ Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with different genotypes.
Test for interactions between genetic variants and the treatment effects of inhibitors on both blood glucose levels and clinical events.","Anticipated Findings
If genetic proxies confirm greater blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular benefit from blood glucose lowering variants, it would provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting combined pharmacological as a novel strategy for incremental risk reduction in high-risk patients, not at blood glucose goal.

Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will aim to identify the social service and support needs of individuals living in rural areas who have a history of CVD, or who are considered to be at high risk of developing CVD (i.e., hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, etc.). We will utilize a combination of survey questions and procedure concepts to identify rurality, while social needs will be identified using survey questions that relate to social determinants of health, healthcare access and utilization, lifestyle, and demographic indices. CVD and associated conditions will be identified using the EHR ""conditions"" domain (i.e., hypertensive heart disease, neurocirculatory asthenia, and ""at increased risk of cardiovascular disease""), the Labs & Measurements concept, and procedure concept ""Annual, face-to-face intensive behavioral therapy for CVD..."".

Dataset: We will use the All of Us controlled tier genomic data and phenotypic data to construct and validate a genome-wide polygenic risk score
Methods:  We utilized the multi-ethnic pan-ancestry UK Biobank GWAS data (available at:https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org) for systolic and diastolic BP as the base data for the computation of the PRS (SNPs and their associated β-coefficients). The BP PRS will be constructed using the PRS-CS approach. The PRS-CS is a Bayesian approach to computing PRS that derives each genetic variant’s posterior mean effect size (weight) from the prior GWAS base data while accounting for the LD using the 1000 Genomes as the reference population. We will use the ϕ values set to 10^-2, 10^-4, 10^-6, and auto, with a p-value threshold of 0.05. Unlike other Bayesian methods such as LDPred, PRS-CS-auto does not require separate derivation and validation subcohorts.
Tools: Plink 2.0; R Statistical Software;","Anticipated Findings
In this comprehensive investigation involving a multi-ethnic cohort of American adults, we anticipate finding a robust cross-sectional association of multi-ethnic BP PRS (polygenic risk score) with BP traits overall and across subgroups of self-identified race/ethnicity was observed.
Second, we anticipate that individuals at an increased genetic risk for elevated BP (measured using BP PRS) are also predisposed individuals to an increased risk of adverse CV events such as heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), or stroke, after accounting for traditional CV risk factors (ACC/AHA Pooled Cohorts Equation [PCE]).
Third, we anticipate that among those with a high genetic predisposition to elevated BP, a low traditional CV risk factor burden (low ACC/AHA PCE risk) will be associated with a lower risk of adverse CV events.
Lastly, in a multi-ethnic cohort of middle-aged adults, BP PRS will provide a modest improvement in adverse CV risk prediction beyond the ACC/AHA PCE.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow acquire somatic mutations that lead to overgrowth of a genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells. The prevalence of CHIP detectable through next-generation sequencing of blood DNA is up to 10% of adults >70 years and nearly 20% of adults >90 years. CHIP has major implications for human health as a risk factor for   age-related chronic diseases including hematologic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, and all-cause mortality.

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians.

With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging.

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) has traditionally been viewed as a disease of men, new evidence suggests the existence of distinct differences in the risk factors, development, and outcomes between the two sexes.  For example, our recent studies have revealed that the genetic factors for several intermediate cardiometabolic traits, represent potentially novel sex-specific mechanisms for CVD.

A series of analyses will be sex-stratified genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) for CVD-related binary traits in the full dataset.  For GWAS of discrete traits, we are interested in coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) as clinical outcomes. We will be using unbiased genetic analysis using whole genome sequencing data with statistical genetic analyses to uncover common and rare variants associated with discrete cardiometabolic clinical traits.","Anticipated Findings
Our previous studies have identified potentially novel sexually dimorphic mechanisms for the development of CVD. Although these results support the concept that the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease in women may differ from men, they also raise several important unanswered questions from a genetics perspective such as what are the mechanisms by which other loci in the genome influence plasma levels of metabolites and lipid species of interest and do they exhibit sexually dimorphic associations with CVD phenotypes?  Similarly, little is known about the genetic determinants that are specifically associated with MI among patients with CAD compared to those that drive atherogenesis. Although previous studies of ours have identified novel variants associated specifically with MI, we believe there are additional loci that are MI specific. Thus, identifying genes involved in the complex pathological processes leading to MI/plaque rupture could have important clinical implications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We Intend to study and understand the association of physical activity with cardiovascular diseases in participants with Fitbit data. There is a critical need to understand whether physical inactivity contributes to the disparity in cardiovascular disease in individuals of different racial/ethnic and sexual orientation/gender identity (SOGI) groups. By exploring the Fitbit data on AoU, we are aiming: 1) to see if there are ways we can use the Fitbit data to support the early detection of disease, such as early detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib); 2) to determine whether intense exercise can improve the resting heart rate; 3) to determine if the Fitbit data can be used to quantitively study the length of sleep; 4) to understand whether the heart rate and exercise level varies by race after adjusting for the social determinant of health (SDOH), lifestyle as well as demographic characteristics; 5) to investigate the interplay of physical activity, RHR and cardiovascular outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
There are four datasets we will use: EHR domains, physical measurement, Fitbit, and survey (lifestyle, family history, SDOH). Below are key research methods and tools: 1, To assess the association between the intensity of physical activity and resting heart rate (RHR), we will include all participants who shared Fitbit data. To predict the proportion of maximum heart rate on minute-level, we will use an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). To balance the interpretability and overfitting, we will conduct machine learning models, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive LSTM to estimate the outcome as secondary analysis. 2, To investigate the interplay of physical activity, RHR and cardiovascular outcomes, we will use Cox proportional hazard regressions to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary outcomes, MACE, among participants by intensity groups, adjusted for confounders at the index date.","Anticipated Findings
First, through this study, we can standardize the data collection process, which fills a gap on how to handle Fitbit data in retrospectives studies. Next, we might discover some specific heart rate patterns that are associated with the increase in AFib, which could lead to early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Furthermore, our study will provide a better understanding of disparities in cardiovascular diseases in vulnerable individuals with varied backgrounds, such as elderly, cancers, which may in turn, lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AFib, thus leading to further studies. With these potential findings, we could advance our understanding of the progression of CVD, and have the potential for clinical translation to precision CVD prevention, and reduce cardiovascular disparities in individuals in a personalized manner.","Demographic Categories of Interest

While traditional risk factors such as diet, exercise, and genetics are well-documented, the potential impact of novel environmental exposures, particularly lithium and pesticides, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge presents an urgent need for comprehensive research to understand these relationships better.
This research is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses a relatively unexplored area of environmental health. Understanding the role of lithium, commonly found in water supplies and used in various industries, and pesticides, widely used in agriculture, in the development of heart attacks and strokes could be significant in reducing the global burden of these diseases. Furthermore, this study could inform policy makers, guiding regulations on environmental exposures and public health advisories.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cerebrovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The study will employ an epidemiological approach, analyzing data from diverse populations to establish correlations between CVD incidence and levels of lithium and pesticide exposure. This will involve detailed environmental assessments, comprehensive medical histories, and possibly biomarker analyses to accurately quantify exposure levels. Advanced statistical methods will be used to control for confounding variables, ensuring the validity of the findings.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study could range from establishing a clear correlation between these novel exposures and increased CVD risk, to identifying no significant relationship. In cases where a positive association is found, the results could pave the way for further research into mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic interventions, and targeted public health strategies. Even in the absence of a significant association, the findings would be valuable in ruling out these exposures as major risk factors, refining the focus for future CVD research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Noncoding regulatory elements, such as enhancers, act as regulators of gene expression. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project and other studies have identified millions of regulatory elements in various tissues. The roles of noncoding regulatory elements in many human diseases have acquired considerable attention, including in cancer, cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disorders. GWAS studies in understanding the genetic basis of these diseases has also identified many noncoding regulatory variants responsible for genetic risk, yet the mechanisms behind these risk variants remain poorly understood. Recent integrating multidimensional genomic data, such as expression, methylation, histone modification, chromatin accessibility and three-dimensional organization data, have enhanced interpretation of noncoding risk variants in human diseases.  However, systematic analysis multidimensional genomic data make things more complex and has become a big challenge in the field.","Project Purpose(s)

Epidemiological evidence has shown climate change (including extreme heat and elevated temperature) and air pollution have adverse effects on population health, especially cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases. However, there is limited information on individual susceptibility to climate change and air pollution in terms of genetic variant, lifestyle and behavior factors. The overall aim of this project is to investigate how climate change, air pollution and lifestyle are affecting cardiometabolic diseases among representative US population in the All of US program. First, we will investigate how climate-related extreme events and air pollution together impact cardiometabolic disease incidence and mortality. Second, we will examine whether lifestyle and behavior information modify the impact of environmental factor on cardiometabolic health.

Do higher rates of chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases in Black participants account for higher rates of pneumococcal vaccination among this group? Are there disparities among people with chronic diseases with regards to vaccination rates?
Immunizations are one of the most important and effective preventative health measures available, but relative to public health goals, are underutilized in adults. Developing a better understanding of how vaccines are used positions us to develop strategies to mitigate modifiable risk factors and improve vaccination rates. Results from our study will address a knowledge gap in understanding data characteristics available in the All of Us dataset for younger adult participants who have received pneumococcal vaccines. Results from this study is intended to provide us with stronger justification for access to medical and pharmacy claims data to develop prediction models on which variables have the highest amplitude of impact.","Project Purpose(s)

The All of Us database will be used as a source population for a convenience sample in this cross-sectional study to characterize the sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of adults who receive pneumococcal vaccines as adults.  These categories of factors will also be used to compare groups of participants who completed the hepatitis B and HPV vaccine series with those who started, but did not complete these vaccine series. Descriptive statistics, correlations and cross-tabulation will be used to describe specific differences in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, gender-based, and health- and lifestyle-related determinants of the use of vaccines in patients included in this unique database. Inferential analysis, including an emerging methodology intended to reduce the biasing effects of missing data will also be applied.","Anticipated Findings
This proposed study provides a cross-sectional evaluation of the All of Us program data to develop a baseline understanding of the relevant and available vaccination data. Most existing literature describing adult vaccination rates are based on self-reports and few focus on correlating health data. Comprehensive data regarding vaccination rates exist, but lack investigation to specific health, and sociodemographic characteristics. More importantly descriptions of vaccine studies have been mainly limited to individual vaccine types. This analysis is a follow up study of previous work utilizing the All of Us database which identified vaccination disparities consistent with the published literature. The use of bias reduction methods also has important implication for a variety of other research questions applied to large EHR databases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Heart failure (HF) is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease. It significantly reduces quality of life, results in frequent hospitalizations, and causes many deaths. Access to care is therefore critical for patients with heart failure in preventing morbidity and mortality. However, research on barriers to care in patients with heart failure is limited, especially for minority groups (sex and gender minority, racial and ethnic minority). This is an important area of study as addressing these disparities can lead to improved outcomes for heart failure patients.
Specifically, the questions are:
What are the barriers to healthcare access for minority groups with heart failure?
How do these barriers contribute to the disparities in heart failure outcomes among these groups?
What interventions can effectively reduce these barriers and improve access to care for all patients with heart failure","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
Our study will utilize a dataset of patients with heart failure, identified using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes. We will categorize these patients into two groups: those belonging to sex and gender minorities (SGM) — defined as individuals with one or more minoritized identities in relation to their sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or sexual orientation — and those identified as racial and ethnic minorities, based on self-reported race and ethnicity (e.g., American Indians, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders; Blacks; Hispanics). To analyze the data, we will employ multivariable logistic regression to explore the association between minority status and the experience of barriers to care.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate discovering that minority patients with heart failure face more substantial barriers to care, particularly in specific areas we aim to pinpoint. By identifying these critical zones, our findings will enable healthcare practitioners to target interventions more effectively and shed light on broader systemic issues affecting minority patients at both individual and institutional levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We aim to validate a new algorithm for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk within the All of Us research dataset. Specific questions we will ask are:
1. How does the new risk prediction algorithm perform regarding the calibration and discrimination among All of US dataset? Calibration refers to the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, while discrimination refers to the algorithm's ability to distinguish between individuals who will experience a CVD event and those who will not.
2. How does the performance of the new self-report algorithm compare to previous commonly used prediction models, such as the Framingham Risk Score, which require more measurements.
We hypothesize that the new algorithm for CVD events prediction will have good calibration and discrimination. Furthermore, we anticipate that the predictive capacity of this novel algorithm will be non-inferior to the traditional Framingham score.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
In this study, we will assess the predictive capability of a new algorithm developed by Huma Therapeutics Limited (London, United Kingdom) within the UK BioBank by using the All of Us dataset. To evaluate its performance, we will exclude participants who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. CVD in our study is defined as a composite outcome including myocardial infarction, heart failure, angina pectoris or other chronic ischemic disease, stroke, and transient ischemic attack.
To assess the predictive accuracy of the new algorithm, we will employ Cox's proportional hazards model and calculate the C-index and ROC AUC in STATA. Furthermore, we will conduct a comparison between the performance of the new algorithm and the Framingham score, a commonly used prediction model for CVD. This comparative analysis will provide insights into the relative effectiveness of the new algorithm compared to the established Framingham score.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we will evaluate the performance of the new algorithm. We expect to evaluate the calibration and discrimination of the new algorithm when applied to the All of Us dataset. By comparing the new algorithm's performance with the widely used Framingham score, we aim to determine if the new algorithm is non-inferior to the traditional prediction model in terms of prediction accuracy. This comparison will provide insights into the effectiveness and potential advantages of the new algorithm.
These findings of this study would contribute to the prediction of CVD by providing a potentially reliable tool for assessing CVD risk in the general population, and serving as an alternative or complementary tool for clinicians and researchers in assessing CVD risk.

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the United States. Many cardiovascular diseases initiate with dysfunctional blood vessels leading to blockages, or occlusions. Our research group studies how dysfunction of the cells that line the inside of blood vessels, endothelial cells, can lead to the development of diseased blood vessels. We have previously identified a list of candidate proteins which we hypothesize may be important in regulating vessel health. While we study the role of these proteins using cell culture models, we plan to use the All of Us database to identify population-level genetic variations in our candidate proteins which lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases. By learning more about how genetics can change the function of endothelial cells and therefore blood vessel health, we can identify potential targets for pharmaceuticals to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Once we identify a correlation between a genetic mutation and a disease, we will validate that the mutation causes disease using cell culture and animal models.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to determine whether persons who carry mutations in our candidate proteins are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease in their lifetime.

Metabolic syndrome cohort will be defined as having any 3 or more of the following conditions: 1) waist circumference more than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women, 2) elevated triglycerides 150 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL), 3) reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) less than 40 mg/dL in men or less than 50 mg/dL in women, 4) elevated fasting glucose of l00 mg/dL or greater, 5) blood pressure values of systolic 130 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic 85 mmHg or higher. Analysis will be performed in the web-based platform Jupyter Notebook using programming language R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to have higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia compared to general participants in All of Us dataset. Metabolic syndrome is anticipated to be associated with higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and T2DM in schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome is expected to report worse quality of life, mental or physical well-being. Smoking, excessive drinking, family history of diabetes, use of clozapine or olanzapine are expected to be associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients. These have been reported in various studies but data from larger national sample would contribute to the growing evidence the anticipated findings stated above.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Question #1: What is the prevalence of housing instability among Veteran and non-Veteran All of Us participants?
Question #2: Which demographic, socioeconomic, substance use, and health characteristics are useful predictors of housing instability among Veteran and non-Veteran participants?
Question #3: Is there a cross-sectional and/or longitudinal relationship between housing instability and diagnoses of cardiovascular, cancer and psychiatric conditions?
Question #4: Does the relationship between housing instability and diagnoses of cardiovascular, cancer and psychiatric conditions vary according to Veteran status?
The All of Us Research Program provides the opportunity to study populations that are traditionally under-represented in scientific investigations, including low-income groups likely to experience housing instability, of whom >10% are Veterans. Research on the epidemiology of housing instability among Veterans and non-Veterans is limited to small sample sizes.","Project Purpose(s)

We will perform secondary analyses of survey and electronic health record data from All of Us participants using tools provided to researchers on the Workbench, including R in Jupyter Notebook. History of housing instability, Veteran status, demographic, socioeconomic, substance use and health characteristics will be identified based on self-reported survey data. We will apply ICD-10 diagnostic codes to identify All of Us participants with cardiovascular, cancer, and psychiatric diagnoses based on electronic health record data. Multivariable risk-adjusted and propensity-score adjusted models will be constructed to examine risk and protective factors associated with housing instability, and housing instability as a predictor of diagnoses of cardiovascular, cancer and psychiatric conditions, before and after stratifying by Veteran status.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that All of Us participants with a history of housing instability are more likely to receive cardiovascular, cancer and psychiatric diagnoses than those with no history of housing instability, and that Veteran status modifies the relationship between housing instability and chronic diseases.

We will utilize national health and nutrition examination surveys that include data on dietary habits, datasets from healthcare providers or national health databases that include information on cardiovascular health indicators among Chinese Americans, and demographic and Socioeconomic information including age, gender, socio-economic status, level of education, and degree of acculturation. We probably will use longitudinal Study and comparable study to analyze health outcomes of Chinese Americans following traditional diets with those adopting more Westernized diets and changes over time in dietary habits and their impact on cardiovascular health. We will employ statistical software like SPSS, SAS, or R for data analysis. These tools can handle large datasets and perform various statistical tests.","Anticipated Findings
Our study is expected to categorize the predominant dietary patterns among Chinese Americans, encompassing traditional Chinese diets, Westernized diets, or a combination of both. A key anticipated outcome is the establishment of clear correlations, or the absence thereof, between specific dietary patterns and various indicators of cardiovascular health. This research will contribute significantly to the broader understanding of how cultural and lifestyle factors influence health outcomes, particularly in immigrant populations. It will enrich the fields of nutritional epidemiology and multicultural health studies.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in the United States. Despite this, only 44% of women surveyed in a 2019 American Heart Association survey were able to correctly identify CVD as the leading cause of death among women. Recently, there is growing recognition that sex-specific and reproductive factors including premature menopause and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase risk of CVD. This acknowledgement highlights the importance of CV risk modification and counseling in a population of women who were previously considered to be low risk for future CV events.

Do providers prescribe statins for hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 DM less often in patients with NASH than those without NASH?
PCP's are reluctant to prescribe statins to patient's with abnormal liver function tests because of the known risk of hepatotoxicity associated with statin use. However, statins have not only been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and type 2 Diabetes, but have also been proven to have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic properties and may thus inhibit progression from simple steatosis to fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

We will also explore potential racial, ethnic, education, income, and geographic location differences CV health within SGM individuals. This project is led by Dr. Billy Caceres who is a CV nurse scientist and a nationally recognized expert on the CV health of SGM individuals. There is growing evidence showing that SGM adults are at greater risk for CV disease than non-SGM individuals. However, potential reasons for these differences are not understood.

How do individual-level factors, such as stress coping mechanisms and social support, impact cardiovascular disease risk among African Americans?","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Qualitative studies will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of African Americans with respect to SDoH, stress, discrimination, physical activity, and sleep, and how these factors impact their cardiovascular health. Dataset to be used will includes de-identified information on physical measures including blood pressure, heart rate, BMI, physical activity and others for about 267,000 participants. There are also survey data, electronic health record including  ICD codes. These data will be analyzed using R and Python data management systems.","Anticipated Findings
- To identify the impact of social determinants of health on cardiovascular risk and disease in African Americans:
- To examine the role of stress and discrimination in cardiovascular disease: It can identify which forms of stress (e.g., work-related, financial, social, etc.) are most strongly associated with cardiovascular disease in this population. It can also investigate how discrimination (e.g., racial, gender, age, etc.) contributes to cardiovascular disease.
-To assess the impact of physical activity and sleep on cardiovascular health: It can investigate whether physical activity and sleep are protective factors against cardiovascular disease in this population.
-To help design interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease in African Americans: For example, it can identify which social factors, stressors, and protective factors to target in interventions. It can also help tailor interventions to the specific needs of African American communities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

GLP-1 RA Association with DR and DME,"Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity.

Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity. Despite the increasing use of GLP-1 RA, their impact on diabetic retinopathy remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence on the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most of this evidence stems from the multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs, which have defined DR differently. Most of the other studies have not been large enough to adequately answer this question. This study aims to investigate the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and DR and diabetic macular edema progression via the All of Us research database. We will also determine whether lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse access to GLP-1 RA and thus worse DR.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
To determine if there is an association between use of GLP-1 RAs and progression/presence of diabetic retinopathy (none/NPDR/PDR) or diabetic macular edema that required treatment in the form of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or corticosteroid (i.e., triamcinolone) injection, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Two cohorts: One on GLP-1 RA therapy and the other not on GLP-1 RA therapy. Only patients with type 2 DM. Patients should not have PDR prior to initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy. Patients should be treatment-naive (no prior intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy).
Covariates: Age at diagnosis of DM, sex, birth country, race/ethnicity, education level, insurance status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, smoking history, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI).
Multivariate logistic regression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that GLP-1 RA therapy is not associated with progression or presence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema that requires treatment in the form of intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy. As the literature currently has conflicting evidence on this question, we hope this study will provide further guidance on this matter. Additionally, we hope that this study will encourage primary care physicians and endocrinologists to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus aggressively to minimize all the associated systemic complications of diabetes mellitus including worsening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema from worsening control of blood glycemic levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Datasets: Fitbit accelerometry data; data regarding diabetes and cardiovascular disease status, blood glucose metrics, cholesterol metrics, and blood pressure.

Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will explore machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are at substantially increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.  A reliable predictive model could be very helpful for identifying individuals at the greatest risk so that they can modify lifestyle and health habits and their physicians can consider pharmacologic interventions and closer monitoring.
We are particularly interested in determining whether the model is as effective for historically underrepresented groups as it is for historically well represented groups.  Historically, medical studies examining prognostic predictors, including for cardiac health have focused on predominantly Caucasian populations and might not be as applicable to underrepresented minorities. Our goal would be to create a model that can effectively predict risk of cardiovascular disease for people of all demographic backgrounds.","Project Purpose(s)

Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is among the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases (1-2 events per 1000 persons per year) and results from an imbalance of hemostasis regulation, resulting in pathologic coagulation and the formation of blood clots.

Can deep learning be applied to ECG data to detect those with arrhythmias of monogenic inheritance? Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for around half of cardiovascular deaths in the United States (US). SCD heritable risk factors contribute to the risk of SCD through monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS). However, routine clinical genomic testing of arrhythmias is inaccessible by its undetermined timeline for large scale employment, complicated by cost and requirement of expert interpretation at large scale. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical modality used to measure electrical activity of the heart, serving as a first-line diagnostic touchpoint for patients, with and without suspected cardiac abnormalities. This study proposes to leverage DL to identify ECG features that indicate monogenic risk of SCD using electronic health record (EHR) and ECG data.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Monogenic arrythmias)","Scientific Approaches
To improve the identification of monogenic inherited arrhythmia syndromes in individuals of diverse ancestry, I will use a deep learning architecture to classify those with genotype-positive disease using clinical and ECG data. This will require use of genomics, electronic health records (EHR), and ECG datasets and coding with SQL and Python in the Research Notebook. While models have been created to classify these different conditions independently, an algorithm has yet to be developed that will classify monogenic predisposition to arrhythmia, with appreciation for ancestry diversity. To determine algorithm utility, I will determine the proportion of individuals with a monogenic inherited arrhythmia diagnosis in their EHR to ascertain new detected cases.  I hypothesize that by integrating data from All of Us, this algorithm will apply widely to diverse populations.","Anticipated Findings
I expect to find a model that can increase selection of patients of diverse ancestry who are genotype positive for monogenic IAS. I will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine missed diagnoses not captured by EHR and number of averted SCD with earlier diagnosis. With access to longitudinal medical record information, I am well positioned to discover non-traditional ECG signatures of patients with monogenic IAS before episodes of SCA through explainability analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Recent studies revealed that Black American die from hypertension more than white Americans (Young, 2022). For Black Americans, the rate of deaths is more than double at 54.1 deaths per 100,000 men and 37.8 deaths per 100,000 women (Young, 2022). Greater expectation of care was associated with adherence to medication, and greater social support was also associated with adherence to medication (Grant, Seixas & Frederickson, 2016).  When hypertension is well-treated and well controlled, it can prevent cardiovascular events than management of other modifiable risk factors (Young, 2022).

Null Hypothesis: There is a difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans in the United States?
Alternate Hypothesis: There is no difference in antihypertensive drug use among Black Americans and White Americans?
Methodology:
Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants' demographics and T-Test will be used to determine the difference between Black Americans and White Americans and antihypertensive drugs.
The researcher planned to access data on ethnic groups diagnosed with hypertension and the usage of antihypertensive drugs. Numerous studies have indicated that black Americans die from hypertension more than white Americans and are diagnosed with the condition more than other races. The Researcher planned to investigate barriers that prevented blacks from using antihypertensive drugs.","Anticipated Findings
If blacks have knowledge about hypertension (knowing the appropriate blood pressure parameters, disease duration, and modifiable factors required for hypertension control) they may adhere to antihypertensive medications with the support system. Finding barriers that contribute to nonadherence to antihypertensive medications may help clinicians to adopt strategies to improve patients' care and well-being. Due to the racial disparities in healthcare and utilization of insurance, the researcher anticipates that Black Americans will not adhere to antihypertensive medications. The social determinants of health can also play a significant role and this can have a major impact on participant’s health, well-being, and quality of life.

Research Questions: What are the demographic features of individuals with elevated total homocysteine levels (tHcy)? What medical co-morbidities are associated with elevated tHcy? Are there genetic variants in the genes of homocysteine metabolism that play a role in plasma hyperhomocysteinemia?
Elevated tHcy is a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders, stroke, thromboembolism, and neuropsychological symptoms. It can be caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, renal insufficiency, or rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMS). Rare IEMs involving homocysteine metabolism can remain undiagnosed due to limitations in newborn screenings, variable clinical presentations, and overall lack of awareness. This study will identify clinical characteristics of individuals with elevated l tHcy, and identify genetic variants in homocysteine metabolism. This can improve medical care.","Project Purpose(s)

In order to address these research questions, we will build two cohorts – one of individuals with elevated tHcy levels (defined as greater than 30 micromole per liter), and one of individuals with normal tHcy levels (defined as less than 15 micromole per liter). The dataset will include demographic information, dietary information, medical history, imaging data, surgical history, lab values, and DNA sequence data for each participant. The dataset will first be analyzed in R using linear and logistic regression analysis to determine if there is an association between these clinical variables and tHcy, which will serve as the predictor variable. If the cohort for individuals with elevated homocysteine is robust, we will proceed to conduct genetic variant analysis. This will be done using Python and assistance from the Research Hub.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that the prevalence of medical co-morbidities will increase with increasing homocysteine levels and that lab values will be more clinically severe with increasing homocysteine levels. These findings will help characterize the clinical presentation of individuals with elevated tHcy levels. Having a better understanding of the population-level characteristics of those with elevated tHcy will help raise awareness of and increase education on the clinical features and outcomes associated with varying levels of tHcy. This, in turn, could help improve detection and diagnosis of elevated tHcy and its underlying causes, thus promoting better prevention and treatment management for the associated clinical outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Many health conditions, including dementia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and mental illnesses, depend on both genetic and environmental factors. Neither genomics or environmental factors alone are sufficient for complete understanding of complex diseases, or adequately address health conditions or inequalities in health. All of Us with rich and high-quality data on genomics and environmental exposures provide opportunities to understand the interactions between genes and environment on health. Specifically, our aim is to develop statistical methods to examine how social determinants of health (SDoH) interact with genes in diseases. Development of such methods is crucial as it can lead to the discovery of novel genes whose effects are modified by environmental exposures, offer insight into biological pathways that may not be detected outside of interaction analyses, and reveal ways by which environmental exposures may differentially impact individuals.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use tree- and forest-based approaches that reflect and detect important interactions without pre-defining them.  Song and Zhang (2014) developed tree-based analysis of rare variants (TARV) to construct super-variants which combine genetic markers in any loci. With the genetic and environment exposure information from All of Us, we plan to use the TARV method  to identify the super-variants and gene-environment factors that are associated with the outcome. Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find novel gene-environment interactions for complex diseases, and some examples of their implications/contributions include:
• Discovery of interactions of genes and SDoH underlying racial disparities in the risk of complex diseases, such as dementia. It has been reported in previous studies that carrying an APOE ε4 allele could correspond to a doubling of risk among white participants, it corresponded to no increase in risk among black participants. We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.
• We could better understand the role of racism in genetic-health associations. Using the measures of discrimination and/or racism in All of US, we can assess not only how the race may affect genetic-health associations, but also the role of racism, and broadly, the culture and social environments.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease.

Arab-Americans experience similar barriers in healthcare access as other ethnic minorities in the US, and tend to have worse health outcomes than caucasian patients. Moreover, Arab-Americans tend to experience a higher burden of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, unlike other minorities, Arab-Americans are classified as ""White"" on US census data as well as in most nationally representative health databases.
Given the unique challenges faced by Arab-Americans, this misguided data aggregation represents a costly missed opportunity to elucidate insights about the health status of Arab-Americans.
We intend to study the prevalence and burden of chronic diseases amongst Middle Eastern and North African identifying individuals, and contrast that with non-hispanic caucasian individuals, in order to elucidate differences in health status and ultimately demonstrate the importance of deaggregating MENA demographics data within healthcare system and databases.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
we will use epidemiological tools to assess whether there is a meaningful difference between MENA-Americans and non-hispanic white individuals in terms of baseline health status, burden of disease, access to healthcare, and health outcomes.
We will perform a retrospective cohort study, and run appropriate statistical analyses while controlling for potential confounding variables.","Anticipated Findings
We except to find a higher burden of disease amongst MENA-identifying individuals compare to non-hispanic white individuals, worse access to healthcare, and worse health outcomes. There is plenty of evidence within the MENA community about these disparities, yet the lack of a ""MENA"" demographic category has prevented these disparities from being validated through large, nationally representative databases. The ""All of Us"" database provides a unique opportunity for the MENA-identifying community to validate the challenges and struggles they have experienced for decades. This visibility and proper representation will be impactful in advocating healthcare systems and large public health databases to include a MENA demographic category, and will help the MENA-identifying community to advocate for and receive federal and local funding as well as appropriate public health interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are exploring the AllofUS data for correlations between Fitbit data (specifically, heart rate and steps) and cardiovascular outcomes. The initial question we pose is: Can Fitbit HR/step data and appropriate scaling of HR with activity be used as a predictor of CV disease and its complications? Participants will be grouped based on their HR at certain activity levels and whether HR is appropriately scaling with activity (i.e. low HR, low step count; low HR, high step count; high HR, low step count, etc.). Using EHR data, we plan to analyze which of these groups are at greatest risk for CV outcomes (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular hospitalization, death, etc.). Should this data be a predictor of the health outcomes described, this project may validate wearable technology's clinical utility in predicting/assessing CV disease. This will also answer a novel question regarding the appropriate scaling of HR with activity and its importance in cardiovascular health.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular disease)","Scientific Approaches
To answer the question above, we plan to explore the Fitbit data, demographic data, and EHR data (including diagnoses, medications, hospitalizations, etc.) available in the AllofUS dataset to find associations with activity/HR and cardiovascular disease. Fitbit HR and step data will be linked, and participants' HR over various activity levels will be used to group them based on whether their HR is appropriately adjusting with activity level. Cardiovascular disease among these groups will then be compared. The availability/granularity of this data will ultimately determine the methods used to answer our question.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that certain groups from those above will be at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and complications from it. Specifically, we suspect that those who have inappropriately high HR without much activity, or those who have inappropriately low HR are at greater risk than those whose HR appropriately adjusts with activity. While other studies may have shown this, or similar correlations, seldom use data as granular as is possible with wearable fitness trackers. With these devices, minute-by-minute data is available for both steps and HR over the course of months to years. No other studies have used data this granular in examining appropriate HR rise/fall in response to activity and how this correlates with cardiovascular disease.

This virus became a global pandemic, and while there were many named co-morbidities- such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer, however, there was very little information about the association of COVID-19 and Lupus. Vaccines are well-studied medications to reduce and have even eliminated many diseases in the national population.

Specific Aim #1 Harmonize and prepare data from several health databases (OCHIN and local data) to make related SLE patients' data AI/ML-ready datasets for using ML. We will employ a collection of functions (pipeline) that will facilitate the organization, preparation, combination, cleansing, and harmonization of data, enabling the creation of SLE AI/ML-ready datasets. These functions will be implemented in Python, utilizing Dataframe and other relevant libraries. We will harmonize multiple datasets organized by race/ethnicity. (To be completed by Q1 of the first year)","Anticipated Findings
Specific Aim #2 Implement ML approaches to identify factors (features) associated with CVD in SLE patients and create ML-based models to predict the level of CVD risks by ethnicity/race.
Several functions (pipeline) using ML algorithms will be used to identify the factors (features) associated with CVD risk in SLE patients. As a result, a list of factors (features) most relevant to CVD risk in SLE patients for each ethnicity/race group (including Caribbean Hispanics) will be obtained.  (To be completed by Q2 of the year)
In addition, several ML algorithms will be trained (i.e., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, others) to create models for predicting CVD risks in SLE patients grouped by ethnicity/race. The best (more precise) ML-based model will be selected for each ethnicity/race group, including Puerto Rican Hispanics. (To be completed by Q3 of the year)","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diseases of the heart and blood vessels, account for approximately 18 million deaths worldwide. Most genetic studies have disproportionately used individuals of European ancestry, leaving minority populations under-investigated. The increased availability of hyper-palatable foods, including foods rich in fat and sugar, is associated with the rapid rise in obesity, dyslipidemia, and CVD.  The present study attempts to 1) elucidate the potential dynamic biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to dyslipidemia and cardiometabolic diseases by combining genomics, exome, metabolomics, and phenome data and 2) identify if the dynamic biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to dyslipidemia are associated with taste-related genes and neural correlates of food preferences from neuroimaging data.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Demographic and covariate variables will include age, sex, race, education level, income, alcohol use, health history, physical activity, and smoking status. Health-related data will include anthropometric and adipometric data, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP in mm Hg), fasting glucose, insulin, weight, height, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). We will use diet, metabolomic profiles from serum samples, genetic data, and imaging data from large population studies. Linear/logistic regression models will be built to assess the gene-environment interactions.
According to Genet Epidemiol: 201-210, to detect an interaction effect size of 2.0 with 80% power, ~2500 samples (N1=N2=2500) are needed. When the interaction effect size is increased to 3.0, ~1800 samples are needed. However, larger sample sizes will allow higher power, which are desirable.","Anticipated Findings
Cardiovascular diseases are associated with disparities in morbidity and mortality rates. Precise screening tools for early detection of at-risk individuals is a priority in public health to address health disparities among individuals from diverse genetic ancestry populations. Considering that cardiovascular diseases have genetic components and associated clinical symptoms, the proposed study aims to elucidate gene-environment interactions contributing to dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases through genetic association analyses. The ultimate goal is to evaluate the possibility of developing predictive models to identify and characterize affected and at-risk individuals from diverse population ancestry.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Can mutations in PTC impact food preferences and lead to hypertensive disorders/hypertension? PTC, also known as phenylthiocarbamide, is a tasting phenotype that has been known to vary amongst human populations. PTC is associated with the ability to taste bitter substances, which has been a genetic, epidemiological, and evolutionary interest to many (Wooding et al., 2004). Since this phenotype varies from person to person, the presence in PTC reflects dietary preference. Per Wooding, PTC perception is capable of revealing the correlation to diet-related disease susceptibility in modern populations (2004). In which case, mutations in the PTC may contribute to the dietary risk factors of hypertension. Thus, the choices individuals with the SNPs that allow for tasting bitterness make about their diet have long term and cumulative effects on their health, specifically forms of cardiovascular disease like hypertension.","Project Purpose(s)

Criteria for the patient cohort includes those who have been diagnosed with hypertension. Possible inclusions are individuals with obesity over a reasonable number of pounds pertaining to average weight for a corresponding age range.

In addition, a search criteria will be refined to individuals with ""tasting and non-tasting'' PTC mutations. Specifically regions on the TAS2R gene on chromosome 7q that codes for bitter taste receptors (Kim et. al, 2003). Search criteria may be refined to identify single polymorphism nucleotides (SNP) as well as mutations in base pairs that code for tasting and non-tasting respectively. Further research will be conducted to isolate specific base pairs. Several sets of data are necessary to plot statistical analysis of each patient.","Anticipated Findings

A quantitative descriptive approach will be used to characterize ZIP3-level area deprivation and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors among the individuals in the study.

We will also include physical activity with the covariates age, sex assigned at birth, sexuality, gender identity, and race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, health insurance status.  We will use logistic regression to determine the odds of hypertension, overweight and obesity , dyslipidemia, poor glycemia control, and also a CMD risk burden score. To assess exposure in the logistic regression model, overall ZIP3-level area deprivation will be dichotomized into two groups. Statistical significance will be set at p <.05. ZIP3-level area deprivation includes both the single factor and Berg 3-Factor area deprivation indices.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate there will be cardiometabolic health disparities (higher disease and higher risk) among sexual minority and gender diverse individuals, individuals from lower socioeconomic positions, historically marginalized populations (e.g. race, ethnicity, uninsured). Those living in areas with greater area deprivation measures will have higher odds of cardiometabolic disease and more risk factors.
Deprivation characteristics may serve to inform novel approaches to improve cardiometabolic health in diverse individuals. The high proportion of an increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiometabolic sequela make these types of social/environmental factors important targets for potentially reducing the disparities.

Using XGBoost algorithm we developed using a training subset of the cohort (50% train + 25% test), ranked 33 covariates (including demographic, treatment-related and social determinants of health (SDOH) information) for ASCVD prediction using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The top 10 predictors were transformed in a predictive equation using logistic regression models. This equation was tested in the cohort validation subset (25%), and subsequently compared to the PCE risk score.","Project Purpose(s)

Results: We included 1,506 patients without prior ASCVD , with a median age of 67 (interquartile range 60-74) years, 13.8% had advanced stage disease (TNM III-IV), 1.5% had high risk PC (Gleason 8-10), and 20.5% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Of those, 10.4% had a 10-year ASCVD risk. The PCE had an area under the curve (AUC)=0.61 and underestimated ASCVD in 0.9% (mean risk=20.1% [95% CI 17.2-23.0] vs. mean predicted risk=19.2% [95% CI 18.6-19.8]).  The equation pooled from the top-10 predictors of the ML algorithm (C-index=0.78 [95% CI 0.75-0.81]) achieved an AUC=0.71.
Conclusions: Conventional ASCVD risk scores tend to underestimate the risk in males with PC. A cancer-specific model inclusive of SDOH exhibited good performance and generated a user-friendly equation for predicting ASCVD risk in this population.

Preeclampsia in women in multiple studies has shown association with aging and aging-related diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular disease later in life. Since this is a discreet event that often happens to women relatively early in their life it provides an opportunity to both better understand the mechanism of preeclampsia and these aging pathways, as well as, a broader understanding of how discrete events can lead to differences in aging over decades.

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women over the age of 65 in the United States, men account for more than half of the deaths due to CVD. Moreover, evidence suggests that cardiovascular disparities exist among men, such that those who identify as sexual minorities are more likely to experience poor cardiovascular health as compared to heterosexuals. The objective of this proposal is to examine physiological and behavioral mechanisms linking self-reported PTSD to cardiovascular disease risk. We also would like to understand the moderating effect of race/ethnicity. The long-term objective of this research is to inform the creation of culturally relevant interventions to reduce the risk of CVD among YSMM.","Project Purpose(s)

The mechanisms linking PTSD and intermediate cardiovascular factors among racially diverse individuals remain under-explored.  Conducting this research is vitally important considering the heightened rates of both stress from discrimination and CVD  disease.

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is characterized by misfolding of the tetrameric transthyretin protein complex that accumulates as extracellular amyloid fibrils and results in polyneuropathy, heart failure, and arrhythmias. We have previously demonstrated that carriers of a genetic variation in the TTR gene (rs76992529; Val122Ile), which is seen more commonly among individuals of African ancestry, have a higher risk of incident heart failure and mortality (heart failure mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality). However, not all carriers of this genetic variant develop heart failure.

Our research focus is to investigate the phenotypic traits and health outcomes that associate with sleep deprivation. This is related to recognizing the health impacts and conditions that could be caused by sleep deprivation. We aim to determine whether or not health differences relate to inadequate sleep patterns.
We can also explore what genetic factors can be related to sleep deprivation-related health consequences. By researching the genetics of individuals, we can further understand what different responses they might have when it comes to sleep deprivation.
Most importantly, we want to work out the possible long-term health effects of sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep could possibly contribute to a variety of chronic disease examples like cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, or neurodegenerative conditions. Our research aims to clarify these critical health concerns linked to inadequate sleep.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Sleep deprivation)","Scientific Approaches
As a method for assessing the health effect of sleep deprivation on observed phenotypes, we perform a Phenome-Wide association study (PheWAS). PheWAS requires a group of association tests exhibiting an indexed summary of the human phenome. In our analysis, we will utilize PheWAS for EHR derived sleep deprivation included in the All of Us research dataset. We will be representing sleep deprivation in three formats: SNOMED code, ICD10CM code, and ICD9CM code. To perform PheWas, we will map ICD representations of disease to a common vocabulary of PheCodes. We then use Jupyter notebooks to create reusable functions to perform PheWAS and generate Manhattan Plots to summarize associations.","Anticipated Findings

This study is aimed to quantify and report the prevalence of common cardiometabolic risk factors among LGBTQIA+ community participants of All of Us. The reason for this investigation is that there exists a paucity of data about the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors among individuals from this community. The community is often stigmatized and often face seclusion from research studies and clinical initiatives. Furthermore, the access to healthcare is limited in the community due to the attached social stigma.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder characterized by lifelong elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and dramatically increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Genetic studies now suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) encompasses five discrete subtypes based on LDL-c levels, 1) a monogenic FH variant, 2) a high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) polygenic score, 3) elevated lipoprotein(a), 4) elevated LDL-c polygenic score with elevated lipoprotein(a), and 5) a positive family history without an identifiable genetic cause, or true “phenotypic FH.” The primary question of this project is: Are there differences in treatment, comorbidities, and ASCVD outcomes between FH subtypes?","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to screen all individuals with whole genome sequences available for monogenic variants in an FH gene. We will calculate an LDL cholesterol polygenic risk score from each participant’s whole genome sequence. Using labs and measurements, we will identify individuals with an FH subtype.

We have evidence to suggest that there is an association between inflammation and cardiovascular disease health.

Moreover, it is unclear how these mechanistic pathways from social determinates of health, through inflammation, to cardiovascular disease risk vary by key sociodemographic features like race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. Thus, the following investigation 2 has research questions.
1. Are environmental features (e.g. housing instability, neighborhood features, etc.) associated with physiological deregulation as measured by inflammation (e.g. cytokines, Interleukin’s, and c-reactive protein, biological markers of inflammation) and thus cardiovascular disease risk?

Does higher visit-to-visit blood pressure predict risk of future cardiovascular diseases?
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and  mortality for the developed countries.
Elevated blood pressure is one of the well-established CVD risk factors.

However, the potential association has not been supported for all studies.
Accordingly, we propose to characterize distributions of blood pressure variations and potential association with CVD risks using the all of us resources.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cardiovascular diseases)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
To characterize visit to visit variation of blood pressure, at least three blood pressure (BP) measurements at different time periods are required.
Therefore, we plan to acquire electric medical record files and capture participants with at least two  BP measurements those who also have physical measurement at study baseline.    We will identify BP-related information through the electric medical records and medication record files.
We will applied available R code for proportional hazard models.   The analysis models will treat CVD diagnosis of death as the outcome variable while BP variability will be the independent variable.   The regression models will include covariates: age,sex, total and HDL-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, BMI, cigarette smoking, as well as mean BP, and BP slope across all BP  time periods.
In the multi-variable regression model for mortality events, we adjusted CVD risk factors and diagnosis of CVD.","Anticipated Findings

1. What is the prevalence of CVD (IHD, and stroke) among participants who did and did not respond to the personal medical history questionnaire.
2. Does the demographic and socioeconomic profile of patients with IHD or stroke vary by whether or not they responded to the personal medical history questionnaire?
2. Does the vascular risk factor profile of patients with IHD or stroke vary by whether or not they responded to the personal medical history questionnaire?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Stroke; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; myocardial infarction)
Population Health
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will restrict our analysis to participants with EHR data who answered the baseline basic questionnaire. We will use R statistical programing language to calculate descriptive and multivariable regression models. Prevalence estimates with corresponding 95% CIs of the prevalence of CVD conditions, and demographic and clinical factors across AoU subcohorts will be calculated and compared with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression models will be estimated to identify factors associated with completing the personal medical history file among patients with IHD or stroke separately.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the prevalence of stroke and IHD will be lower among participants who responded to the personal medical history questionnairewith EHR release than among participants who responded to the basic survey with EHR release alone. Moreover, we hypothesize that patients with IHD or stroke who filled out the personal medical history questionnaire with EHR release will have a higher proportion of White participants, be of higher socioeconomic status and will have a lower vascular risk factor burden than those who did not fill out the questionnaire.
This study will provide important information regarding potential limitations to the generalizability of data in All of  Us across various subcohorts based on responses to different questionnaires. These data can be used to support expanded work in IHD and stroke by establishing the external validity of disease cohorts in AoU.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The aim of this study is to conduct a large-scale phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to explore the relationships between genetic variants in genes related to mitochondrial fission and fusion and a wide range of human disease phenotypes.
Mitochondria are important cellular structures that undergo processes like fission, fusion, and movement. Dysfunctions in these processes have been associated with various diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and aging. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies in large populations that investigate the associations between genetic variants in mitochondrial fission and fusion genes and different disease outcomes. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing combinations of genetic variants in these genes to better understand disease associations and gain insights into underlying mechanisms.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Mitochondrial fission and fusion related diseases)
Methods Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To study the effects of functional rare coding variants in mitochondrial fission and fusion genes, we will use a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) approach. PheWAS involves association tests over the human phenome using HER-derived medical conditions from All of Us research dataset. Additionally, we will adopt a pathway-centric approach that leverages biological pathway information to analyze these genes collectively, as traditional rare variant analysis may be underpowered. We will map ICD representations of diseases to PheCodes and use Jupyter Notebook to create reusable functions for PheWAS and generate Manhattan Plots summarizing associations. This research aims to identify genetic causes of diseases and advance our understanding of mitochondrial dynamic in human health.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we anticipate that we will be able to validate some known disease associations with dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion pathways. It is important to note that the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and diseases is multifaceted. While there is evidence implicating dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion in various diseases, the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate the genetic evidence in humans to unravel the complex molecular pathways in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and their potential roles in the pathogenesis of diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

EHRs provide one of the most efficient ways to examine cannabis-related health outcomes in large unbiased patient populations. In this project, we will study safety of cannabis for those with medical and psychological conditions. Outcomes will be: (1) cardiovascular events, (2) admissions for psychosis, (3) accidents, (4) suicide attempts, and (5) survey responses about anxiety, depression, and sleep, and (6) medications. We will also look at IDC codes for anxiety and mood disorders, as well as psychosis. We will also examine Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome,. These outcomes have been chosen because they have been associated with cannabis use, are major drivers of healthcare costs, and are extractable from the EHR and surveys.

We will create a cohort of those who use cannabis and those who do not use cannabis. These will be linked to health outcomes. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of any cannabis use (by self-report) by health diagnoses/symptoms will be estimated using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models in R, adjusting for year, median neighborhood household income, age, and self-reported race/ethnicity, and potentially other substance use. We will also examine levels of cannabis use via ordinal regression.","Anticipated Findings
Safety and effectiveness of cannabis is particularly well-suited to be studied through All of Us, which will link substance use to EHRs and create an unbiased data set of those who use cannabis. The National Academy of Sciences has called for such clinical epidemiological research to investigate the safety and effectiveness of cannabis use for a variety of health conditions.

Menopause transition (MT) is a hormonal imbalance in women starting at the age of 40 that elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. The decline in estrogen during menopause increases the risk of CVD. In racial and ethnic minority groups, this risk is higher, particularly among Blacks (58.5%), Hispanics (42.7%), and Asians (42.5%). (American Heart Association, 2021). The study analyzes the demographic data of CVD-related medical conditions and their relationship with MT, which highlights the importance of addressing CVD health during menopause.","Project Purpose(s)

The study examines sex, age, race, and cardiovascular disease-related conditions (hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) in a sample of 372,380 participants from the National Institute of Health (NIH) All of Us Data Browser and Workbench. The data was analyzed to raise awareness of CVD risk in women. The All of Us Research Data Browser was used to obtain information regarding age and sex, whereas the data collected from the All of Us Workbench was regarding race and ethnicity. The racial and ethnic categories include Asian, Black, White, Hispanics and Latinos, and Other (which contain the subcategories ""I prefer not to answer,"" ""None Indicated,"" ""None of these,"" and ""Skip”).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects women, or people with ovaries, worldwide. Because non-female identifying people with ovaries are a population of interest in this study, the proposed study will not exclude those who identify as another gender but were assigned the female sex at birth. People diagnosed with PCOS, typically via sonogram or ultrasound, also present with numerous other health issues. Being diagnosed with PCOS is also linked to reproductive irregularity, insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, and many more. These different aspects of health are issues known for being further affected by minority identities such as non-white Race and sexual/gender minorities. Not having enough power, or a large sample size, may be adversely affecting the associations among people with PCOS and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although, there seems to be inconsistency among studies finding statistically significant relationships between CVD risk and PCOS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The overall study design will consist of a cross-sectional case control where age, sex, and race will be matched between cases and controls.  The main outcome variable is CVD risk, which will be measured as a score of 3 levels: ideal, average, and poor. This score is taken from the American Heart Association’s guidelines on assessing and preventing cardiovascular disease. This is known as the Life’s Simple 7 score and is compiled through covariates of heart disease like smoking status, BMI, exercise, cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose, and diet. In addition to those covariates, demographic information, which is also collected by All of Us, will be included in the analysis. There will be an attempt to keep many diverse racial and gender/sexual minorities (assuming sample sizes are adequate). Statistical analysis plans will consist of logistic regression on a three-level factored outcome variable (Simple 7 score).","Anticipated Findings
The researcher anticipates interpretable findings from this study. Because the research question is presented as an investigation of a relationship, there is no anticipation of whether the CVD risk among PCOS populations will sway one way or the other. Previous literature and research has shown that there may be an increased risk of CVD among these populations, which may be exacerbated by the presence of other determinants of health like race, assigned sex at birth, and many more. Overall, the purpose of the study is to add validated and sound research to the body of literature with All of Us data, specifically.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Research Question
What is the incidence of heart failure or adverse cardiac events in Black/ African American women who are long-term (5 years or more) survivors of breast cancer?
Why is this question important?
African American (AA) breast cancer survivors may have elevated risk for cardiovascular disease because of the high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in this population.

The primary objective is to quantify both cardiovascular risk and adverse cardiac events in long-term (five years or greater) breast cancer survivors, and determine how cardiovascular risk prior to diagnosis, during treatment, and after completion of treatment affects health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare multi-system disease which arises from a chromosomal microdeletion of 7q11.23, comprising 25 to 27 genes, including the elastin gene. The defects in the elastin gene, leading to elastin haploinsufficiency, underlie the arteriopathy in WBS, although alternate genes are known to modulate cardiovascular phenotypes. Cardiovascular problems are the main cause of morbidity and mortality and occur in 80-85% of all WS patients. Great vessel diseases are the most common cardiovascular abnormalities in WBS, however any artery can potentially be involved due to elastin haploinsufficiency.  Sudden cardiac death is also a prominent feature that is the leading cause of death among WBS patients. Recent studies pointed out the autonomic and heart rate dysregulations in WBS. Based on this, we would like to investigate the heart rate and sleep patterns among WBS patients.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the genetics and associated information in the All of Us research dataset to analyze genetic contributions to bipolar disorder, its comorbidities and treatment response, in racial and ethnic minority populations. Specific questions we will ask are:
1. Are the genetic associations for bipolar disorder previously identified in white populations also associated with Black and Latino populations?
2. Are genetic associations between biopolar disorder and cardiovascular disease (or metabolic syndrome) observed in white, Black, and Latino populations?
3. Are there unique genetic polymorphisms in Black populations associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder treatment?
We hypothesize that genetic associations with bipolar disorder in racial and ethnic minority populations will partially overlap with genetic variation previously identified in white populations, but that there will be unique population-specific variation as well, particularly for lithium response.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Bipolar Disorder)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use PLINK and/or other GWAS tools within the All of Us Research Workbench on whole genome sequence data. The population with bipolar disorder or manic episodes without a bipolar disorder diagnosis will be defined by ICD-10-CM codes of F31.x and/or F30.x respectively. Racial and gender self-identification will be used as primary covariates with other demographic variables (e.g., age) considered as confounding variables. Ancestry informative markers and whole genome PCA will be used to control for genetic ancestry and population substructure. We will also consider BMI and other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol diabetes). Lastly we will examine therapeutic doses of lithium and lithium response (where possible). Limitations include lack of specificity in diagnosis and/or presentation and incomplete or unclear data on efficacy of specific pharmaceutical therapy.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate confirming that genetic variation associated with bipolar disorder in white populations is similar, though not necessarily identical, in racial and ethnic minority populations. We also anticipate identifying genetic factors unique to these populations, particularly associated with lithium response. Trans-ethnic studies are important, even as validation studies, because they extend our understanding of disease to populations that have been traditionally underserved in medicine. Further, these studies will elucidate differences in response to lithium that have hindered proper access to treatment.
Because the intersection of mental health, genetics, and racial disparities can be stigmatizing, we surveyed the patient community and developed a community advisory board (CAB) of stakeholders (including patients) focused on bipolar disorder and genomics for regular feedback. This is in addition to more general CABs and collaborative efforts towards mental health literacy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

I have developed a method called SLAC-Time, which utilizes a self-supervised learning approach for clustering multivariate time series data with missing values. I intend to apply SLAC-Time to group patients with cardiovascular diseases using the data from the All of Us dataset. This is fitting, as these patients are represented through clinical multivariate time-series data. Therefore, this context presents a suitable scenario for evaluating the effectiveness of SLAC-Time. In this research, I will investigate if SLAC-Time provides clinically meaningful clusters of cardiovascular patients and if there is a significant difference between the clusters. We are going to identify the feature profile of the cardiovascular patient phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiovascular diseases)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
The scientific approaches I plan to employ in this study mainly revolve around the utilization of SLAC-Time, a self-supervised learning-based method I have developed. This approach is tailored for clustering multivariate time series data, even in instances where certain values may be missing.
The primary dataset I intend to work with is the All of Us dataset, which contains a wealth of health data from diverse individuals. This dataset is particularly useful for my study, as it includes a rich set of clinical multivariate time-series data that represents patients with cardiovascular diseases.
Lastly, the tools I will use for this study are likely to be a combination of machine learning frameworks, statistical analysis software, and data visualization tools. They will be used to implement SLAC-Time, analyze the results, and visually represent the clusters of cardiovascular patients and their defining features.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study will hopefully reveal that SLAC-Time can effectively cluster cardiovascular patients in a manner that produces clinically meaningful clusters. Additionally, we expect to find a significant difference between these clusters, which will give us insights into the various phenotypes of cardiovascular patients.
These findings will contribute to the body of scientific knowledge by providing a new perspective on patient grouping based on time-series data. Moreover, the application of SLAC-Time on cardiovascular disease data could help in personalized treatment approaches, understanding disease progression patterns, and potentially uncovering new subtypes of cardiovascular diseases. The ability to handle missing data will also provide a more robust tool for real-world clinical data, which often contains gaps. This can potentially lead to more accurate disease prediction and patient management strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is a key enzyme in the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and is associated with ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Knockout rats for SphK1 gene exhibited heightened susceptibility of the myocardium to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, which impaired protective effects of IPC (PMID: 17610857). S1P exerts its protective function by binding to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). A specific genetic variant of S1PR1 (rs41287280, c.37C>T, p.R13G) has previously been identified as a potential protective factor against coronary artery disease (PMID: 25293589). However, the impact of this genetic variant on cardiovascular outcomes in myocardial infarction (MI) patients remains uncertain. Hence, this study aims to investigate the independent association between the rs41287280 genetic variant and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in patients with MI.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective community-based cohort study will be conducted enrolling all genotyped patients who had myocardial infarction (MI). All demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will be collected. Patients will be stratified into two subgroups according the harboring of the genetic variant. A propensity score matching method will be used to match patients by their clinical variables at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression will be applied to assess the independent association between the rs41287280 genetic variant and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (primary: 3-point MACE; secondary: CV death, non-fatal MI, hospitalization for heart failure). Bonferroni's p-value correction method will be applied to prevent false-positive associations.","Anticipated Findings
If our findings corroborate previous evidence, individuals with the rs41287280 genetic variant are expected to experience significantly fewer cardiovascular events compared to those without the variant. This is the first study to date to reveal the influence of this genetic variant on cardiovascular outcomes in individuals who have experienced myocardial infarction (MI). The research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge regarding the impact of genetics on the individual variability of cardiovascular outcomes in those with similar clinical characteristics. Furthermore, it may unravel the significance of protective metabolic pathways, such as SphK1-SP1, in activating ischemic preconditioning, which holds immense therapeutic potential.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations.

Primary headache disorders, including migraine, are debilitating neurological conditions, managed with acute and preventive treatment, with and without medications.  Aerobic walking has several health benefits, it is included as one of non-pharmachological treatment strategies. Counting steps during walking is a method of evaluating daily activity, and may help individuals achieve physical activity goals. A higher number of steps per day has been associated with reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, GERD,  but limited information is available for migraine and other headache disorders.
The purpose of this study is to assess","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Headache Disorders, Migraine)","Scientific Approaches
All participants with FitBit data will be included in this study. Our data set will include demographic information, history of medical conditions (cardiovascular, obesity, depression), headache disorders diagnosed by eletronic health records and by self-report diagnosis at the patient provided information medical history questionnaire,  mean blood pressure, height, weight, mean waist circumference, mean hip circumference, mean heart rate, and daily summary activity Fitbit data. Mean number of steps per day will be illustrated with descriptive statistics. We will analyze differences in mean steps per day for our subgroups of interest  with t-tests, and plot daily step counts with incident risk of headache disorders.","Anticipated Findings
The goal of this project is to describe physical activity in individuals diagnosed with headache disorders by quantifying the amount of steps taken per day. We also aim to understand if steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex in headache patients versus matched controls without pain conditions and any other disease. Based on prior literature, we predict a mean number of steps per day of approximately 5,000. Migraine individuals may have lower mean steps compare to controls.  Additionally, we predict mean steps per day will be higher in male and white participants.
Further, we expect the relationship between steps per day and migraine is inverse and linear.  The findings may provide a real-world evidence-base for clinical guidance regarding activity levels that are necessary to reduce the disease burden of headache disorders.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mosaicism of chromosomes is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. While this age-related phenomenon has been known for many years, awareness of the potential role of mosaicism in human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancers, and cardiovascular disease, is a more recent development. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mosaicism in hematopoietic cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Based on prior studies, cardiac (atrial) inflammation, and fibrosis can result in disruption of normal atrial conduction and is a powerful predictor of risk for the development and progression of atrial fibrillation. In the current study, we aim to better understand the association of mosaicism with the development and progression of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to characterize a spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 genetic variants. More than a decade after the discovery of the trypanolytic missense variants in APOL1, it is now known that APOL1 high-risk variants are relatively common in individuals with sub-Saharan ancestry and are associated with higher risk of progressive chronic kidney disease. Although associations with cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, and preeclampsia have been reported, these associations warrant replication. Considering the expression of APOL1 in a wide range of cell types and that it is found as both a circulating and intracellular protein, it is likely that other diseases may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants and that these associations may be missed due to study design and statistical power. We plan to conduct a phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) using All of Us datasets to shed light to possible undetected diseases and phenotypes that may be associated with APOL1 high-risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Since APOL1 is exclusively found in individuals with sub-Saharan African ancestry, we plan to create a cohort of individuals who self-identify as Black (including Hispanic, African, African American, and Caribbean individuals and assess corresponding genomics data (for APOL1 genotyping), electronic health record (EHR) data of AoU datasets including diagnosis (ICD) and baseline demographics and measurements (BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, clinical chemistry data, and hormone levels). We will classify individuals into three groups based on the number of risk alleles carried: 0 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G0 genotype), 1 APOL1 risk allele (G0/G1, G0/G2), and 2 APOL1 risk alleles (G1/G1, G1/G2, G2/G2). Then, we will conduct a phenome-wide association study, to define the spectrum of phenotypes associated with APOL1 high-risk variants using PheWAS R package.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases, creatinine and albuminuria measurements will show association with APOL1 high-risk genotypes that are consistent with previous reports, but given the size of the All-of-Us cohort, should narrow the confidence interval giving a more precise odds-ratio and a relative risk. Similarly, we can confirm (or not) the previously reported associations of sepsis, preeclampsia, and cardiovascular diseases with APOL1 high-risk genotypes, which would bring additional evidence that the association between these conditions and APOL1 high-risk genotypes. If novel phenotypes are found to be associated with APOL1 high-risk variant this will open new areas for investigation of APOL1-associated phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

A leading cause of death and disability, there has been increasing interest in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke etc.) earlier in life using genetic information to appropriately identify individuals who are most at risk. These predictions are based on using multiple genetic markers and are called polygenic risk scores.
Individuals with chronic kidney disease are particularly at risk of cardiovascular disease, with risk increasing as kidney function declines. Given kidney function changes over the course of an individual’s life, predicting events in this population may be more difficult.
We would like to assess how existing polygenic risk scores perform in the kidney disease population and if this can help target treatments to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use existing polygenic risk scores and assess their performance in the chronic kidney disease population. It is well established that existing genetic risk scores perform poorly in populations with different ancestry from which they were developed. Given measurable disparities in kidney disease and associated cardiovascular disease, we hope to assess performance stratified by genetic ancestry.
Prior to using genetic data, we are going to study the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in AllofUs stratified by self-reported ethnicity and assess whether there are enough cardiovascular events to perform the analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that polygenic risk scores generated in a predominantly European ancestry populations will perform poorly in individuals with kidney impairment, particularly when applied to individuals with different and diverse ancestry.
Although impairments of kidney function are common, repeated measures of kidney function are often lacking in the general population. We can use this to understand to what extent the change in kidney function over time is contributing to differences in performance. This latter aspect has not been addressed in prior work.

Cardiovascular disease risk is known to be influenced by both the severity of a risk factor and the duration of exposure. However, this concept has been largely neglected within the obesity literature. While obesity severity has been closely linked with cardiometabolic diseases, the risk of developing these conditions among those with obesity may be augmented by greater obesity duration over the lifespan. Few longitudinal or contemporary studies have investigated the influence of both factors in combination – cumulative obesity exposure – instead generally focusing on obesity severity, often at a single time point, given ease of use and lack of established methods to encapsulate duration.

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in Americans, but certain minority groups are more affected, one being African Americans. Heart disease is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle. African Americans with heart disease were also impacted by Covid-19. Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During the Covid-19 pandemic, African Americans who had heart disease developed a condition called myocarditis. Myocarditis is inflammation of the middle layer of the heart. It can cause a weakened heart, heart failure, abnormal heartbeat, and sudden death. There seemed to be a link between myocarditis patients and people who tested positive for Covid-19. This research showed that cardiovascular disease was found in African Americans more after they had been impacted by Covid-19, which led to myocarditis because of their dietary habits, physical inactivity, and stress.","Project Purpose(s)

For the predictive model, we plan to try both traditional machine learning models like linear regression and SVMs as well as deep learning models to compare the different techniques and decide which is the best for the task. For the network analysis, we plan to look at different measures of centrality (degree, eigenvector, and closeness) and similarity (cosine and jaccard) to better understand the different risk factors and how they relate to different disease outcomes.","Anticipated Findings

Aim 1. Examine if physical activity measured with FitBit is associated with four cardiovascular diseases (AFIB, MI, stroke, heart failure). This first aim will determine if FitBit, a commercially available product with over 30 million users, is able to measure PA with the same accuracy as current standard measurement technologies. This will be accomplished by demonstrating the same pattern of association as previously established literature.
Aim 2. Determine if heart rate, stratified by nicotine use, is associated with four cardiovascular diseases.The second aim will quantify heart rates patterns which are associated with CVD. These heart rates will be stratified by four tobacco use groups to allow examination of tobacco use as a potential moderator of the relationship between heart rate and CVD.","Project Purpose(s)

I want to use Artificial Intelligence to predict at what age a person is most likely to develop moderate to severe heart disease based on a variety of inputs, including their age, family history, other medical conditions, and lifestyle.

Our training data will be the group of people who have already been diagnosed with a form of heart disease, and at what age they were given this diagnosis. Our inputs to the model will include traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease, such as age, height, and weight of a person, if they’ve already been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes, family history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure and/or diabetes, their smoking and drinking habits, and their physical lifestyle. We will also explore various other inputs included within the All of Us dataset to investigate whether there are additional inputs which may be a significant indicator of developing heart disease. Modern machine learning methods such as supervised classification algorithms and supervised regression algorithms will be implemented using Python. Our output will be a potential age range of when they are likely to develop a moderate to severe diagnosis of heart disease.","Anticipated Findings

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity;  (2) risk factors; and (3) potential causal mechanisms associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 1%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD) and related health conditions (e.g., depression and pain).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Second, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions.

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between dental infections (as consequence of dental caries and pulp necrosis) and additional diseases (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) although limitations of such studies hamper conclusive interpretations . We showed that apical periodontitis (pulp necrosis with bone resorption) was strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease; further, we identified an association between an established hypertension-associated gene with apical periodontitis in a well-characterized population. These findings strongly indicate that a shared genetic etiology could contribute to oral health-systemic health relationships. By using All of Us data, we hope to validate our previous findings and expand knowledge of the etiology linking oral health and systemic health. We will identify additional factors (social determinants of health) that may play a role in the interconnectedness between oral health and general health.","Project Purpose(s)

Data available via All of Us research workbench shows 20 dental infection conditions that reflect a continuum of dental infection (i.e., dental caries, pulpal and periapical conditions) of interest. We are interested to investigate if relationships exist between these dental infection conditions with type 2 diabetes, hypertensive disorder, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart murmur and cerebrovascular accident.
We will access demographic, clinical (dental and medical) and genetic data from individuals with the above conditions (no exclusions based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or genetic ancestry). We will test for association between a set of conditions, and will also identify potential genes/variants associated with a combined phenotype of dental infection + systemic condition using a variety of tools and statistical methods. All of Us data will allow us to identify a large sample of unrelated controls to increase confidence in the results.","Anticipated Findings
Much of the controversial findings in epidemiological and genetic association studies looking at oral/dental and systemic conditions is due to differences in populations studied, data ascertainment methodologies, but mainly due to limited sample sizes. This study will leverage high-quality demographic/clinical and genomic data of a large and diverse dataset that will allow the best (largest) evidence to date.

Individuals with complex diseases can have different mutations within a single gene or set of interacting genes, which predispose them to the same disease. To address this issue, we are developing a new statistical method that produces ""epistatic scores"" — summarizing how strongly genes and pathways interact and drive the broad-sense heritability of a phenotype or trait of interest. Our research will test several control condition phenotypes for traits that are supposed to be more heritable and less susceptible to environmental influences, to include less complex and more visible phenotypes such as height, as well as health-based phenotypes such as cardiovascular risk. Recent studies designed to estimate the effects of interactions on complex phenotypes have demonstrated that genetic and environmental factors both contribute significant marginal effects; however, the interaction between them has been consistently deemed non-significant to the broad-sense heritability of these traits.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The main statistical framework we will use is the ""MArginal ePIstasis Test"" or MAPIT (Crawford et al. 2017, PLoS Genet), a linear mixed modeling strategy for detecting genetic variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) involved in statistical epistasis in genetic mapping studies. In the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MAPIT estimates and tests the marginal epistatic effect or the combined epistatic effect between SNPs of interest and all other SNPs in the data. We propose to apply our method to multiple traits assayed in the AllofUs dataset, including Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Type 2 Diabetes, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Standing Height, and Body-Mass Index. Our research will yield new insight into the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying these traits.","Anticipated Findings
We aim to interrogate whether interactive effects between genes and different environments contribute to explanations of complex behavioral traits. For example, we can interrogate the interaction between genes that may contribute to the risk of depression and environmental modifiers. By extending the MAPIT framework, we will characterize the risk and measure how environmental and structural features (e.g., socioeconomic status, neighborhood, etc.) serve as statistical covariates. With regard to public health relevance, these novel sets of associations and actionable variables can influence how illnesses are diagnosed and treated. Statistics historically underrepresented the impact of environmental conditions on genetic outcomes; therefore, we aim to provide a more appropriate statistical test for interrogating gene-by-environment effects within and between populations regarding their impact on complex behavioral phenotypes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In order to understand the relationship of platelets and how abnormal counts can affect or lead to patients with diseases and disorders, we will be looking for relationships in various problems including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.
Questions to be researched are as follows:
1. How do patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease compare to those without in the general population in relationship to platelet count?
2. For patients with multiple of the listed conditions, is there a concentrated effect on platelet count?
3.. For patients with such conditions, is there a link between the signaling pathways that each disease uses?
By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures.

1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one the leading causes of death in the world and rates can differ by ethnicity and race due to both genetics and environment. Cardiometabolic phenotypes such as lipid levels, blood pressure, BMI, and blood glucose levels are established CVD risk factors and are used clinically to define pre- and overt disease.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for nearly 30% of postpartum maternal deaths (PMDs) and 81% of CVD-related deaths occurred in postpartum. CVD-related PMDs are often associated with missed or delayed diagnoses, and most could be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. However, existing CVD risk assessment models such as Modified WHO classification, CARPREG II, and California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) algorithm are lack of sufficient ability to accurately predict postpartum CVD since (i) most postpartum CVD cases had no prior diagnosis of CVD, (ii) many symptoms of CVD overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms, and (iii) only a few risk factors were included in the models. Most importantly, no existing model has accounted for the complicated temporal dynamics during the pregnancy, which could serve as invaluable evidence for predicting the postpartum disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We will (1) characterize the risk factors accounting for temporal variants for postpartum CVD using unsupervised ML techniques.

Our working hypothesis is that the novel ML models accounting for temporal dynamics will achieve better performance compared to the existing models; and (3) Assess the potential to reduce healthcare costs by the prevention and early diagnosis of CVD.

We hypothesize that individuals with the diagnosis of prurigo nodularis, a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The purpose of exploring the data is to identify if those with the diagnosis of prurigo nodularis have a higher risk for stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. The exploration of this data can lead to further interventions to prevent cardiovascular mortality in those with prurigo nodularis.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Prurigo Nodularis )","Scientific Approaches
We aim to determine the association of prurigo nodularis with stroke and myocardial infarction by conducting a cross-sectional population study with the data. Patients with the diagnosis of prurigo nodularis will be identified by searching the electronic health record data for adults 18 years of age or older with the International Classification of Diseases code, L28.1. Stroke and myocardial infarction will be identified by using the International Classification of Diseases codes, I63.9 and I21.9, respectively.","Anticipated Findings
In accordance with other inflammatory skin conditions, we anticipate that individuals with the chronic, inflammatory skin disease, prurigo nodularis, will have a higher risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. There are few reports describing the association of prurigo nodularis with cardiovascular disease.

We will conduct a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of family history of common chronic diseases in diverse All of Us participants. We will also investigate the risk of various chronic diseases based on reporting a  family history of the same disease or other diseases. We will investigate factors associated with increased familial risks such as age of onset of disease, number of affected relatives and other covariates. Family history is considered one of the most important risk factors for health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and other chronic conditions. Even though many researchers have studied risk of family history of few chronic conditions, the family history module of All of Us research data set contains 104 different conditions that can be analyzed to assess familial risk in more details.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Other Purpose (The data will be used to analyze disease specific data on family health history and publish the results in a journal )","Scientific Approaches
We will use simple descriptive analyses and logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios of family history of chronic conditions adjusted for demographic characteristics and other variables available in personal medical history, lifestyle, and the basic modules of the survey. We will also look for interactions between family history and other modifiable risk factors on disease risks","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show the percentage of survey participants with a family history of chronic disease out of those who have that disease and the association of the chronic disease with the family history of that disease. Each year since 2004, the Surgeon General has declared Thanksgiving to be National Family History Day, and encourages Americans to use his ""My Family Health Portrait"" which is an internet-based tool that makes it easy to record family health history. However, information on family health history on currently available surveys are limited to few chronic diseases. Our findings using All of Us data would contribute to expand the knowledge of how family history is been reported by various populations and how it may be related to the risks of various chronic diseases.

Diabetes remains an overwhelming public health burden in the United States with the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes reaching an estimated 8.7% of the adult population in 2019. Among patient with DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Importantly, the burden of disease is not shared equally across the population; racial and socioeconomic disparities are evident in recent DM data.
The goal of this project is to use the All of Us Research Program database to explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in composite CVD risk factor control amongDM patients with and without CVD. We want to know 1. Among patients with diabetes mellitus with and without CVD, what is the extent of composite risk factor control (BP, HbA1c, LDL-C, BMI, tobacco status, activity level? 2. How is race, ethnicity, sex, income, and healthcare access associated with number of risk factors at target for control?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Demographic data will be compared in patients with and without CVD using a survey t test for continuous variables or Chi-squared test for categorial variables. We will use a chi-squared test of proportions to compare the proportion of patients at target individual and composite risk factor control between patients with and without CVD. Multiple logistic regression will be used to identify if race, sex, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare are associated with individual and composite risk factor control.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that there are different patterns in terms of risk factor control across DM patients with and without CVD depending on social determinants of health, which will help to identify the possible prevention strategies for DM and CVD and address social determinants to improve health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The primary scientific approach of this work space is analyzing the data in the All of Us Database regarding maternal mortality, cardiovascular health, cardiovascular risk factors, and social determinants of health. We will be looking at the differences in maternal health outcomes between Black and white populations in the database, as they relate to differences in these cardiovascular and social metrics, along with genetic data. The primary statistical analysis will be T-tests that evaluate the impact of genetic influences on differences in maternal mortality, along with information about how the socioeconomic status of individuals can predispose them to a high mortality rate.","Anticipated Findings
Currently, much of the data collected suggest one reason for the high maternal mortality rate in African American women in the United States; cardiovascular-related complications. We hope to find potential alternative conclusions that suggest other causes for the high maternal mortality rate in African American women. We also anticipate demonstrating the fallacies in the current race-based  view of cardiovascular health differences and elucidate possible social determinants of cardiovascular health that are, in turn, affecting maternal mortality rates. The workspace will analyze all aspects that create a poor healthcare system, the long-term effects of systemic racism, and a cycle of neglect towards this population. The findings from the analysis will contribute in creating awareness of the true factors which contribute to maternal mortality, and how to identify and prevent such factors effectively.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Age related hearing loss, or presbycusis, has been associated with cardiovascular disease, with hypertension as a predictor of faster rates of hearing decline10. Impairments in cochlear microcirculation and perfusion have been identified in patients with presbycusis. RAS targeted treatments have the potential for system-wide vasoprotective effects with the potential to protect microcirculation within the inner ear and thus preserve hearing in such clinical conditions with significant vasculopathic contributions. We propose to query population databases to identify previously unexplored associations of RAS blockade and hearing loss.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Profound sensorineural hearing loss)","Scientific Approaches
This experiment will leverage the considerable power of population databases to identify previously unexplored associations between anti-hypertensive treatment with RAS inhibitors and surrogate measures of hearing decline, including hearing aid use, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, and progression to cochlear implantation. These retrospective epidemiological experiments will test the specific hypothesis that among patients who are treated for hypertension, those who are prescribed ACEis or ARBs will have a lower frequency of diagnostic codes for hearing loss (e.g. ICD 9 code 389.1 and 389.2) and of cochlear implantation (e.g. ICD 9 codes 20.96 to 20.98) than those patients on other antihypertensive treatments (e.g. diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta blockers). We will test this aim via a database review of the All of Us database.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that findings from these studies may greatly aid in the translation of these therapies into the clinical realm.

Persons with bipolar disorder (BD) are at significantly increased risk of excess medical morbidity and early mortality.  To our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive descriptive epidemiologic paper of physical conditions in BD, the way there are descriptive epidemiologic papers of psychiatric comorbidity in BD.  The majority of research has focused on a particular physical system (e.g., cardiovascular), combined mood disorders or exclude BD entirely, or do not address comorbidity and disparities amongst conditions.  Most of the US national surveys with superb psychiatric phenotyping are aging.  Correspondingly, there has been a shift from survey research to secondary analyses of electronic health records, registries, and biobanks.  We will comprehensively describe burden, correlates and disparities, and multimorbidity of physical conditions amongst persons with BD in All of Us.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (bipolar disorder)","Scientific Approaches
In an effort to assess the utility and important differences in the shift from representative surveys to large-scale clinical registries, we will be conduct descriptive analyses of physical conditions in persons with BD in All of Us. Such analyses include calculating means and proportions of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and comorbidity assessed by calculating odds ratios between BD and physical conditions, as well as across sociodemographic strata.  We may further enrich our understanding of these associations by estimating population-attributable risk proportions and examining tetrachoric correlations.","Anticipated Findings
Comorbidity may be more common in clinical samples than representative epidemiologic surveys, although occasionally clinical biobanks have more healthy participants than observed in broader clinical datasets.  Additionally, the All of Us is contemporary whereas US nationally representative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys (e.g., the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication) are approximately 2 decades old.  For these reasons, we expect to observe differences in comorbidity between BD and physical conditions when comparing All of Us to prior surveys.  We expect to observe salient disparities that may suggest important follow-up research questions as well as potential opportunities to improve care/service.  This will be a contemporary resource on burden, correlates, and disparities in BD comorbidity that can inform future studies, and lend insight into the potential modernization of psychiatric epidemiology data.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We anticipate gaining a better understanding of the risk factors that influence the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and associated diseases and risk factors. We anticipate gaining a better understanding of the genetic components of disease risk, and the genetic contributions to other phenotypes that may ultimately play a role in disease development or progression. These findings would ultimately help identify people at risk for disease prior to symptom development; would nominate potential therapeutic targets; and would improve our understanding of diseases and their risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am interested in understanding the determinants of reproductive aging, which includes the variations in the age at natural menopause, as well pathological conditions, such as premature ovarian failure and premature diminished ovarian reserve. Ovary is the first organ to age. Reproductive aging has implications for future fertility and overall health. Age at menopause is associated with all cause mortality and several morbidities, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. I would like to explore All of Us data to formalize a specific research question with the ultimate goal to discover the variables that are associated with the natural variations in menopause age and pathological acceleration of ovarian aging.","Project Purpose(s)

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable cause of premature mortality globally.  Elevated BP, with an estimated 30-50% heritability, is considered a precursor phenotype for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, including heart failure (HF), stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD). A genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) integrates the cumulative effects of common genetic variants across the genome and provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic risk of CV diseases.
This study aims to pursue an investigation of a genome-wide BP PRS constructed in a multi-ethnic cohort to examine: 1) the association of BP PRS with BP traits (SBP, DBP, MAP, PP, and HTN); 2) the association of BP PRS with CVD events; 3) the association of traditional CV risk factor profiles with CVD events stratified by BP PRS categories, and 4) the incremental contribution of BP PRS to CVD risk prediction using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohorts Equation (PCE).","Project Purpose(s)

Hispanic and Latino individuals are the largest minority population in U.S. and have a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular risk factors and chronic kidney disease.

Although socio-economic factors, such as suitable access to health care, may play a role in the differences of the disease risks across diverse populations, a better understanding of the genetic determinants influencing cardiovascular risk factors and the chronic kidney disease risk in Hispanic or Latino individuals will allow for personalized medical treatments, contributing to mitigate the health disparities.

Aerobic walking has known health benefits and is one of the preferred methods of exercise given its low risk profile. Counting steps during walking is a method of evaluating daily activity, and with the rise of wearable technology, has become even easier. Additionally, studies have shown that counting steps may help individuals achieve physical activity goals. Further, a higher number of steps per day has been associated with reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Prior studies evaluating steps per day in the United States rely on data collected more than ten years ago. With the advent of new wearable technology, we aim to explore the more contemporary All of Us Fitbit data to assess the following questions:
1.	What is the average number of steps per day in all participants?
2.	Do average number of steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex?
3.	How do number of steps walked per day differ in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease?","Project Purpose(s)

All participants with FitBit data will be included in this study.

We will analyze differences in mean steps per day for our subgroups of interest (age, race, sex, history of cardiovascular disease) with t-tests.","Anticipated Findings
The goal of this project is to describe physical activity in the US population by quantifying the amount of steps taken per day. We also aim to understand if steps per day differ by age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Based on prior literature, we predict a mean number of steps per day of approximately 5,000. Additionally, we predict mean steps per day will be higher in male and white participants. Further, we expect those with cardiovascular disease to take less steps per day.

Statins are a cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality and disability in the United States. Despite the conclusive evidence to the reduction of mortality among ASCVD patients, adherence patterns to this treatment remain alarmingly low with rates of discontinuity approaching 50% in the US population. Current research investigating this pattern have elucidated the impact of clinic-specific factors and patient-physician interactions, but these studies have been limited in generalizability as a result of operating in isolated health care systems. I seek to implement novel computational techniques to analyze patient record data en masse and to uncover the epidemiology of treatment adherence and to address unmet clinical needs of particularly vulnerable patient populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will use machine learning algorithms to analyze electronic health records in the aggregate. This will allow the identification of patterns of treatment adherence for statin medication across the population.","Anticipated Findings
Previous research has suggested that patient adherence is multilayer, affected by factors like differences in clinical systems, patient-physician interaction, and systemic inequality. However, the difficulty of parsing through unstructured clinical notes has reduced many study designs to look at single health care systems and introduce significant bias in the findings. This has limited a robust understanding of the epidemiology of statin use and have likely contributed to unmet clinical needs of patients particularly from high-risk and vulnerable communities. My work will fill gaps in the understanding of statin adherence to inform future policy changes and promote better access to care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We would like to define cohorts based on antiplatelet medication usage and relevant cardiovascular events using the Cohort Builder and Dataset Builder. Specifically, we will query the number of patients who have been prescribed antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, aspirin, etc. Furthermore, we would like to ascertain the number of patients who have experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event while on therapy. Assuming the sample size seems adequate, power analyses may be performed to determine if genetic analyses are warranted. If it is deemed feasible, a robust analytical strategy will be developed to test for association between genetic markers and related clinical phenotypes in patients who have been prescribed antiplatelet therapy.","Anticipated Findings

Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Antiplatelet therapy is routinely used to reduce the rates of recurrent cardiovascular events in those who have suffered an initial event. Understanding the factors that influence response to treatment not only allows us to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of variable antiplatelet response but may also lead to more personalized strategies to reduce adverse clinical outcomes in those who are prescribed these medications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction and stroke) are leading causes of death and morbidity in the U.S. Many epidemiological studies have found associations between environmental exposures (e.g., air pollutants, weather, and green space) and these health outcomes. However, our understanding is limited on the potential effects of short-term exposure to extreme temperature and its interaction with other environmental exposures and whether such effect varies across different age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status remains unclear. The scientific question we intend to study is whether daily exposures to extreme temperatures are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke and whether certain population subgroups are more vulnerable.","Project Purpose(s)

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions.

We aim to use differential penetrance among ancestries to investigate the role of epistasis and ancestral genomic background on a cardiovascular disease (CVD) pathogenic variant.
More specifically, it was recently discovered in a paper by Murdock et al that the LPA variant rs3798220 known to increase CVD in European ancestry individuals was not strongly associated with CVD for those in the Hispanic community. To investigate this pattern more fully and understand genetic drivers for this difference in CVD, we are investigating whether ancestral haplotypes surrounding rs3798220, or an additional variant enriched in the Hispanic population explains the decreased CVD risk.","Project Purpose(s)

Mineral metabolism disturbances are ubiquitous in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with fracture risk, soft tissue and vascular calcification, and cardiovascular-related mortality. GWAS of circulating mineral metabolism markers among individuals of European ancestry have identified common variants associated with circulating PTH, calcium, phosphate and FGF23. The impact of  these variants among persons with CKD, who have the most pronounced disturbances in mineral metabolism, is unknown. Moreover, it is possible that genetic associations may differ according to racial background, given known racial-ethnic differences in PTH and vitamin D metabolism in patients with CKD.  Elucidating these associations specifically within a CKD population is important, not only because of the marked abnormalities in mineral metabolism and racial-ethnic differences, but also because these abnormalities are systematically evaluated and treated in clinical practice among persons with CKD.","Project Purpose(s)

Genetic variation plays an important role in disease-related traits, such as body mass index (BMI), cholesterol levels, and other lab values associated with cardiovascular disease. One important way of identifying disease-relevant biology is by examining rare genetic variants resulting in the complete loss of function of a given gene. This occurs when an individual contains two copies of a damaging variant at the same genetic locus. These variants (called ""knockouts""), though rare, can result in extreme phenotypes that can reveal important disease mechanisms leading to novel treatment approaches. Sometimes, these variants can even result in lab values associated with lower disease risk, which provides an important clue for potential strategies to improve health. This study, building off preliminary data from the UK Biobank, will examine the association of genetic knockouts on disease-related traits.","Project Purpose(s)

It is well known that there is a strong association between Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). Although there are several CVD prediction scores available to predict the probability of CVD in the general population, none of them are accurate enough to estimate the extent of CVD risk in CKD patients. For example, the Framingham score has been questioned as it was created based on a homogenous, geographically restricted and predominantly white population. Additionally, there are other factors (non-traditional risk factors of CVD that are specific to CKD such as albuminuria, anemia, fluid overload etc.) which are not included in the Framingham score which may play an essential role in estimating ischemic heart disease in patients with CKD.  As a result, it may overestimate the risk and have poor discriminatory power in the CKD population. All these indicate the need for the development of more appropriate risk factors to assess the CVD risk among CKD patients.","Project Purpose(s)

•	The baseline data collection will include but not limited to age, sex, CKD stage, CVD’s history, medications history as well as traditional CVD risk factors.
•	Baseline renal functions and other parameters related to CVD will be assessed and those include: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, low-density cholesterol (LDL), high-density cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP).

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We want to identify and characterize important disease manifestations, serologic profiles, and treatments for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There are known to be differences in these between men and women, and also among different racial groups within the United States. We are interested in also studying the variation of these with sex, race, and socioeconomic factors. Additionally comorbidities and other health characteristic such as BMI or smoking history are believed to be important in disease outcomes including other system involvement or cardiovascular events. There have not been many large databases or study cohorts with SLE patients that include detailed information about these factors that are believed to be clinically important so the All of Us database provides a unique opportunity for observational study of these factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (systemic lupus erythematosus)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to report observational data of a cross-sectional cohort of all adult patients from the All of Us database who have a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in EHR records. We will make a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics including sex, age, race, annual household income, education level, self-reported quality of life, and smoking status. Subsequent analyses will compare the presence of organ specific manifestations of SLE and of cardiovascular events between male and female participants and between races using presence of EHR codes. We will use self-reported survey data to describe the frequency of barriers to healthcare access. We will also estimate the validity of self-report of SLE by comparing patient reported history of SLE with EHR documentation of this diagnosis.","Anticipated Findings
Male patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are described across multiple studies to often develop more severe disease. Patients with SLE in the United among specific racial groups, including black and Hispanic patients, have also been described to develop more severe disease. These are attributed to a combination of genetic variance in the underlying disease and to social and environmental factors. Therefore, we anticipate men may have more frequent organ specific disease manifestations than women with SLE. Cardiovascular events are more common in men so we anticipate a higher rate of events in men with SLE. There is limited data on whether serologic positivity important to SLE is more prevalent among men than women so this prediction is less clear. This will be valuable as there is limited data characterizing SLE in men in a large cohort, or in characterizing the barriers to healthcare access among patients with SLE, which are potential targets for care improvement.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This question is important because there is a lack of public knowledge on the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular health and how this may differ between men and women. Therefore, we are interested in analyzing prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors according to COVID-19 test positivity.  Since there are some sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes, we wish to examine how comorbidities, risk factors, and behaviors may differ between men and women.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use the cohort builder to find participants who tested positive for COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria will include cardiovascular risk factors, behaviors and comorbidities. Our exclusion criteria will include people who tested negative for COVID-19. We will then create a second cohort of participants who have tested negative for COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria will remain the same as the first cohort, but this time the exclusion criteria will include people who tested positive for COVID-19. We will also stratify our cohorts into male versus female. After, we will create a dataset builder, and generate concept sets on cardiovascular risk factors (eg hypertension, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity), behaviors (diet, smoking, physical activity), and comorbidities (prior history of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, COPD, diabetes). We will then import the data to Jupyter Notebook and write code in R to analyze our data.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study are that males who tested positive for COVID-19 will have the most cardiovascular risk factors, followed by males who tested negative for COVID-19, females who tested positive for COVID-19, and lastly, females who tested negative for COVID-19. We expect that males who tested positive for COVID-19 will be more likely to have hypertension, diabetes and less physical activity compared to females.

Both incidence & mortality of prostate cancer are significantly higher in patients who identify as black as compared to other race groups (Odedina et al 2009).

We are interested in investigating the relationship between SDOH and 1. Cardiovascular disease end points including but not limited to stroke, MI, and hospitalization for HF.  2. Mortality
This analysis will enhance understanding of how different demographics are affected by prostate cancer. Understanding how factors such as education, access to healthcare, amongst other SDOH may play into both cardiovascular outcomes and mortality could potentially help shape treatment plans that are better catered to the specific needs of specific patient populations. This would be particularly helpful for patients that come from historically underserved populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Population: Our population of interest is prostate cancer patients in the US.
Outcome: We want to investigate mortality and cardiovascular disease as outcomes.
Exposure: SDOH such as education, economic measures (income for example), physical infrastructure, access to healthcare, and other relevant determinants
Covariates: race, age, location, BMI, smoking history, alcohol use, comorbidities (such as diabetes, hypertension etc), occupation, lifestyle habits (sedentary, active etc)
Analysis: We plan to use longitudinal data analysis to investigate the outcomes listed above. We will control for the covariates listed and see how outcomes differ based on the exposures of SDOH and treatment types. We will separate our analysis for the two sets of outcomes: cardiovascular disease, as well as cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.","Anticipated Findings
Studies have been conducted to investigate relationships between specific SDOHs and mortality, particularly to try and understand the large racial disparity in outcomes. Some have shown that low-income may lead to higher mortality rates (Tewari et al 2009). Furthermore, over time as changes in screening recommendations and interventions have been complemented, there has been in a decrease in risk associated with prostate cancer (Cooperberg et al 2003). In regards to our interest in CVD, studies have shown a similar relationship between lower income and CVD incidence (Kreatsoulas and Anand 2010). Through our analysis, we will evaluate this association in men with prostate cancer population. We anticipate that analysis using the comprehensive All of Us data will provide further insight into how the different SDOHs and treatment types impact outcome, in particular since we would be able to analyze multiple social determinants simultaneously, unlike in prior papers.","Demographic Categories of Interest

NF1 is one of the genes with hypermutable patterns across the genome. Although primarily associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1 is also reported to have many manifestations in ophthalmologic, vascular, glioma, and central neuro systems. In the cardiovascular system, renal artery stenosis is considered one of the major causes of hypertension for patients with NF. However, the NF1 penetrance on the renal artery stenosis is still not clearly defined and the epistasis of other genes is also poorly understood.  Here we want to explore 1) the penetrance rate in the general population; 2) the epistasis between NF1 and other genes.","Project Purpose(s)

All variants were annotated by Annovar with the following databases: gnomAD population frequency (v2), dbNSFP (v3.5), CADD score (v1.3), and ClinVar database.
All variants were predicted to be deleterious (ie: disease-causing) by in silico analysis if meeting any of the following sets of criteria: 1) nonsynonymous variant with phred CADD score > 20 and gnomAD allele frequency < 0.01%; 2) variants with considered to have evidence of pathogenicity according to the predicted loss of function (start-loss, stop-loss, stop-gain, frameshift indels, or splice-site) or non-frameshift indels, with gnomAD allele frequency < 0.01%; or 3) defined as likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in ClinVar.
Then the annotated variants and the clinical phenotype information from the same individuals will be converted to a contingency table and tested by Fisher's exact test.","Anticipated Findings
1. Get the penetrance rate between NF1 and RAS;
2. Identify the potential epistasis between NF1 and other genes.

Based on early studies from the genetics community, we envision being able to answer salient research questions in the field of cardiovascular genetics. First, what are the causal genes for vascular disease, aneurysmal disease, and their risk factors ? Second, which genes are uniquely responsible for driving vascular disease and/or aneurysmal disease in the peripheral vascular bed and not in other vascular territories? Third, will a set of genotypes allow us to predict who will be at highest risk for severe vascular disease, including chronic limb threatening ischemia? While substantial work has been performed in establishing the genetic determinants of vascular diseases, including PAD, coronary disease, carotid disease, and aortic aneurysm (abdominal and thoracic), disentangling the genes that specifically affect one disease process or another (or, one vascular bed or another) remains elusive. We intend to us the All of Us resource to answer these key questions, as outlined below.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (vascular disease)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The last decade of genetic association analysis has demonstrated that the effects of common DNA sequence variants are modest (each individual mutation identified increases disease risk by ~2-20%) and thus, large sample sizes will be necessary to fully elucidate the spectrum of common vascular disease mutations within the population.  We intend to leverage the following methods for genomic analysis:
1) Discovery Genome-wide Association Study analysis in the common variant space
2) Explore the phenotype consequences of vascular disease risk variants
3) To associate predicted loss-of-function variation with vascular disease leveraging whole genome sequencing data
4) Bayesian tools to combine genomic data with publicly available gene-expression data to identify potential therapeutic targets (ie, colocalization analyses with data from repositories like GTEx)
5) Bayesian tools to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for genomic risk prediction, including for disease progression","Anticipated Findings
We believe our findings will contribute to the body of scientific literature through the identification of:
1) Novel genes and variants associated with vascular disease
2) Genes and variants that target one specific type of vascular disease over another
3) Genes and variants that target one vascular bed over another
4) The spectrum of consequences for disease-associated variants
5) Individuals at the highest risk of progressive disease through genomic risk prediction
In each of these cases, the above data can be used to prioritize causal genes and pathways for novel treatments. Through the discovery of vascular disease-associated genes and describing the range of effects of disease-associated variants, we aim to elucidate key insights of biologic and pharmacologic potential. We hope that the identification of such risk factors, cell types, and genes may be used to inform clinical care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The exact genetic origins and the molecular mechanisms of cardiomyopathies are still largely unknown. GWAS studies have been informative in identifying variants that lead to cardiovascular disease. However, attributing the molecular function to significantly enriched variants  and putting these variants into the context of disease mechanism remains challenging.

Using this GWAS data, we will link variants associated with each cardiovascular disease to a list of genes predicated to be impacted by these variants (eQTL analysis).

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the world and also in the United States.  Screening asymptomatic patients at high risk for CHD is essential in preventing morbidity and mortality related to ASCVD. The traditional risk factor assessment tools fall short in identifying intermediate risk patients. More biomarkers are therefore needed to improve risk stratification in this risk category. The role of iron-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of CVD has been demonstrated in several animal models its role in humans is still controversial partly because of the use of iron metrics that are strongly influenced not only by systemic and tissue iron burden but also by inflammation and also the cross-sectional nature of the past studies .

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) includes stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), documented coronary artery disease (CAD) with stable angina, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), coronary or other arterial revascularization, peripheral vascular disease with or without claudication, and aortic aneurysm. In clinical practice, physicians will also include asymptomatic CAD (meaning, without angina)  with demonstrable ischemia on a stress test.

60-80% of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) risk is heritable.  Both genetic and environmental factors are responsible for the development and progression of LOAD. Many LOAD susceptibility genes have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While genetic factors contribute significantly to the risk of developing LOAD, the impact of environmental factors on the disease remains multifaceted. We propose a research proposal that assesses gene-environment (G×E) interactions in LOAD to analyze All of Us data. We will test these hypotheses: 1) individuals with the same or lower genetic risks will face an increased risk for LOAD when modified by higher environmental risks (vulnerability), whereas those with the same or higher genetic risks will experience a reduced risk when influenced by lower environmental risks (resilience); 2) effects of genetic risks on LOAD will vary modified by midlife and later-life environmental risks across ethnoracial groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are well-established in LOAD studies and feature an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to LOAD by aggregating genetic effects of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), thus serving as a comprehensive score for genetic risks.

We will also use an item response theory (IRT)-based model to generate environmental risk scores (ERSs) and investigate the interactions between PRSs and midlife/later-life ERSs in LOAD across ethnoracial groups. We will utilize the All of Us genetic data and published GWAS summary statistics to construct LOAD PRSs and construct midlife and later-life ERSs based on various environmental indicators in the All of Us data, including social of determinants of health (e.g., education and incomes), physical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and depression), and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol, and exercise) variables.","Anticipated Findings

Informed by data indicating an overall risk (PRS modified by ERS) for LOAD, this approach may enable clinicians and individuals to initiate disease screening and discuss life planning strategies. This study would also provide a crucial tool for informing the design and implementation of personalized therapeutic and preventative programs, enabling more precise and individualized approaches to the treatment and prevention of LOAD.

I intend to study how polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease correlate with various wearable data, such as sleep patterns and heart rate among healthy individuals. This research is necessary because it aims to shed light on the potential early indicators or risk factors for Alzheimer's disease before symptoms appear. By understanding how genetic predisposition interacts with lifestyle factors, we can potentially identify interventions or preventive measures to delay or mitigate the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
I am exploring the data to formalize a specific research question at this stage because I believe wearable data can provide valuable insights into the early stages of Alzheimer's disease development. The scientific question I hope to answer using the data is whether individuals with a higher polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's disease exhibit distinct sleep and heart rate patterns compared to those with a lower risk score.","Project Purpose(s)

I will select a cohort of healthy individuals with available SNP genotype or whole-genome sequence data and additional datasets such as Fitbit data,  social determinants of health, and/or Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
I will adapt previously published Polygenic Risk Scores (PGSs)  to compute individual PGS for Alzheimer's disease by utilizing genetic data.
I will gather wearable (Fitbit) data, including but not limited to sleep patterns and heart rate. This data will provide insights into participants' daily activities and physiological parameters.
I will examine the relationship between PGS for Alzheimer's disease and wearable data. This may involve correlation analysis and regression modeling to identify patterns and associations within the data.
I will integrate EHR data into the analysis to supplement the wearable data and provide additional context and clinical information.","Anticipated Findings
1. The study may reveal correlations between polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease and various wearable data such as sleep patterns and heart rate.
2. Certain patterns or changes in wearable data may emerge as potential early biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease risk.
3. The study findings could offer insights into the underlying mechanisms linking genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease with physiological changes captured by wearable devices.
4. By identifying potential early indicators of Alzheimer's disease risk, the study could inform the development of preventive strategies or early intervention approaches.

This research will utilize pooled data from multiple cohorts, in addition to stand-alone analyses in All of Us.

We will use quantitative methods including genetic analysis and instrumental variables to evaluate misclassification and quantify bias in estimated effects on ADRD-associated outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
This study will improve the validity of lifecourse research cohorts and provide more valid and public health-relevant estimates of the effects of genetic, social and potentially modifiable determinants of ADRD.

Non-invasive and low-cost tools for early detection of individuals at high risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are of crucial importance. While genetic studies (GWAS) exist, most focus on European populations, limiting their application to diverse groups. Given the Eurocentric biases in GWASs, PRSs are better at predicting AD risk for European ancestry as opposed to others. This research addresses this gap by developing a multimodal hazard score (MHS) that incorporates ethnically and genetically diverse populations. Our team established a successful polygenic hazard score (PHS) that predicts AD onset in European cohorts. Higher PHS predicted greater cognitive decline in CN, entorhinal cortex volume loss and predicted conversion from cognitively normal (CN), to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.  This suggests its potential as a robust genetic risk indicator to be included in the MHS while also looking into diverse populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
Leveraging data from the different AD cohorts, we will conduct Cox proportional models to develop the MHS combining age, PHS, brain atrophy, biofluid-based data, and clinical outcomes to predict neurocognitive decline trajectory. This score will be able to predict AD progression and identify individuals at high risk of transitioning from cognitive normalcy to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventually AD in a generalizable population. Additionally, we will also compute power calculations to estimate required clinical trial sample sizes after hypothetical enrichment using the MHS. Finally, we aim to replicate these findings in other diverse cohorts to ensure broader applicability.","Anticipated Findings
We believe this MHS surpasses single-modal and European data-driven models in predicting AD for diverse populations. This could pave the way for earlier intervention, more efficient research, and ultimately, improved outcomes for individuals at risk of AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In an aging population cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health issues and people at risk of or with established CVD often develop early cognitive decline. This may progress towards dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. Both dementia and CVD, share a number of key risk factors such elevated blood pressure regulation, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. All of these risk factors have known genetic determinants, which may differ across ancestry groups.

The impact of APOE4 on risk, rate of decline, & differential effects of the first AD-modifying disease medications has begun to have a major impact on the fight against AD. Recent studies in relatively small cohorts raised the possibility that APOE4 has a smaller impact on AD risk in African American/Black & Hispanic/Latino than in non-Hispanic persons.

Data from participants with these genotypes who are initially ages 60-80, don’t have initial diagnosis of AD dementia & have 5+ years of subsequent EHR data. Survival analyses will control for potential confounds of age, sex, education & if available an indicator of SES. To test our hypothesis with improved statistical power, we will combine HM & HT into an aggregate APOE4 carrier group, compare survival from AD dementia in initial analysis & control for the potential confound of differences among ethnic/racial groups in the carrier group.

We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle.

We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings

The proposed method utilizes a SNP network to capture interactions between genetic variants based on linkage disequilibrium scores. The network represents the complex relationships among genetic factors. Feature propagation, a technique that refines genetic variant information based on graph neural networks (GNNs), is then employed to predict AD risk scores. Meanwhile, following the concept of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), brain imaging endophenotypes enhance prediction power and identify significant regions affecting specific diseases. Moreover, a generative artificial intelligence model is applied to produce pseudo-imaging endophenotypes for samples with only genetic information.","Anticipated Findings

This study seeks to address several critical scientific questions with direct relevance to Alzheimer's disease and public health. By exploring patients with Alzheimer's and examining their lifestyle choices through survey questionnaires, we aim to uncover insights into the lifestyle factors associated with cognitive preservation or decline, the potential modifiable factors for preventing Alzheimer's, and how personalized care plans can be tailored to the unique preferences of Alzheimer's patients. These questions are pivotal as they hold the potential to advance our understanding of the disease, inform public health initiatives, improve the lives of Alzheimer's patients, and guide evidence-based care and preventive strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
For this study, I plan to employ a multifaceted scientific approach that combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with quantitative and qualitative research methods. To begin, EDA will serve as the cornerstone, allowing me to gain valuable insights and uncover hidden patterns within the datasets collected through survey questionnaires. These datasets will encompass a wide range of lifestyle factors, including dietary habits, physical activity, cognitive engagement, and social interactions among individuals with Alzheimer's. Qualitative research methods, such as interviews or open-ended survey questions, will complement the quantitative analyses, enabling a deeper understanding of the personal experiences and perspectives of individuals living with Alzheimer's. This integrated approach will facilitate a holistic examination of the research question and yield comprehensive and well-informed conclusions.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study hold the potential to make significant contributions to the field of Alzheimer's disease and gerontology. By investigating the specific lifestyle choices and trends among individuals living with Alzheimer's, we aim to uncover valuable insights, including the identification of beneficial lifestyle factors, insights into disease progression, potential preventative measures, personalized care development, and relevance to healthcare policy. These findings are not only focused on enhancing the lives of people with Alzheimer's but also on advancing the broader scientific understanding of how lifestyle choices impact the progression and management of the disease.

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
To address the scientific question of exploring Alzheimer's genetic data in underrepresented populations, particularly focusing on variants associated with AD in the African American population, we will employ the following methods:
Data Preprocessing and Quality Control: Perform quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the genetic data. Filter out variants with low quality scores, genotype call rates, and those that are not relevant.
Variant Calling and Analysis: Use bioinformatics tools such as GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) or SAMtools for variant calling and genotyping.
Association Studies: Utilize statistical methods such as logistic regression or linear mixed models to assess the association between genetic variants and disease phenotype while controlling for potential confounders.
Functional Annotation and Pathway Analysis: Annotate identified variants to understand their functional consequences (e.g., protein-coding changes, regulatory effects).","Anticipated Findings
Upon identifying variants associated with Alzheimer's disease in the African American population, we will annotate these variants to comprehensively understand their functional consequences.

5. Is there any relation with the polygenic risk score (PRS) for EOAD within the population utilizing data obtained from an extensive Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)?
The above-mentioned questions are important due to
1. Determining the Age Range of Onset Of EOAD.
2. Calculating Ethnicity or Race Frequency: It helps to understand the disease's epidemiology across diverse populations.
3. Proportional Distribution of Pathogenic Variants.
5. Evaluating Polygenic Risk Score.

The present research is an observational study that involves observing and recording data without manipulating variables. Here we use the epidemiological and genetic datasets of EOAD using the 'All of Us' Research Program controlled tier and spanned from Fall 23 to Spring 24. The study population is EOAD patients. For data analysis, we used statistical software such as R, Python/Jupyter Notebook with libraries like NumPy and Pandas, or specialized software like SPSS. Different types of tests will be done such as the Shapiro-Wilk test will be done to see whether the retrieved data is normally distributed or not, the Chi-squared tests (to test the epidemiological data) along with mean+/- standard deviation and the polygenic risk scores, first calculated it and then perform statistical analyses to assess the association between the PRS and the disease such as linear regression. ROC  and  AUC can be used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the PRS.","Anticipated Findings
Our study hypothesizes that early onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) exhibits a wide age range of onset due to its hereditary nature. We anticipate observing variations in the manifestation of EOAD across different races and genders. Our investigation suggests that pathogenic variants play a significant role in the development of this disease. Furthermore, we aim to explore the association between calculating polygenic risk scores and the occurrence of EOAD, seeking insights into the genetic factors contributing to its onset.
The anticipated findings would contribute significantly to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD) in several ways:

All prevalent human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s or diabetes, are known to be driven by a complex combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Numerous genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of genetic variants to common diseases. By design, GWAS
only find associations with a disease but cannot reveal which genetic variants are causal within
associated regions of the genome.  Current “fine mapping” algorithms, which aim to
pinpoint the truly causal variants, fail if there are too many variants that are inherited together, which is
often the case. This project will develop a new fine mapping method that uses GWAS data to identify

The new method is based on a mathematical approximation that makes it much faster than existing

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a complex spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms ranging from short-term memory lapses to the gradual loss of bodily functions leading to eventual demise. This condition significantly diminishes the quality of life for the affected older population. The widespread adoption and continual enhancement of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S have resulted in the accumulation of extensive longitudinal EHR datasets, providing valuable resources for clinical research. Numerous risk factors associated with AD, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, are routinely documented in patients' EHRs. This study endeavors to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to facilitate the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The focus is on utilizing real-world electronic health records (EHRs) to enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities in the realm of neurodegenerative disorders.","Project Purpose(s)

Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an early stage poses a formidable challenge due to the involvement of multiple intricate mechanisms in its pathogenesis. Our research aims to delve into diverse patient cohorts with AD, utilizing extracted features and exploring feature selection through both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches. We seek to unravel the prediction variances across different cohorts and prediction windows while assessing the significance of distinct features within each cohort using SHAP values.","Anticipated Findings
The ultimate goal of our study is to develop prediction models that can effectively identify individuals at a heightened risk of AD before its onset. These models not only pinpoint crucial factors for early prediction and prevention but also contribute to understanding why specific risk factors hold significance. Furthermore, they play a pivotal role in guiding research directions and facilitating the recruitment of individuals in the early stages of probable AD for inclusion in clinical trials.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.

Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Genetic research has greatly increased our knowledge for the genetic basis of this disease, however despite this, we have made little headway in the discovery of disease modifying or preventative therapeutics. Additionally, genetic research for AD, as well as other diseases, is dominated by those of European ancestry. To address these issues, we are focussing on 2 scientific questions.
1. Are there genetic modifiers that affect risk for developing AD in carriers of the APOE e4 genotype? Having just one copy of the APOE e4 genotype greatly increases the risk for developing AD, however, many people possess two copies of the APOE e4 genotype and never develop AD.
2. What variants affect AD risk for non-European populations? Leveraging different LD patterns, we can increase the power to detect additional risk variants.","Project Purpose(s)

Our plan to address these 2 questions is through a series of meta-analyses and follow-up work. The plan for question 1 is to perform a Genome-Wide Association Study of AD in APOE e4 carriers only. We will use the AllofUs genetic datasets as well as the demographics age, sex, and AD disease status. We will use Plink software to carry out this analysis. We will then meta-analyze these results with summary statistics from other AD cohorts. Follow-up will include FUMA and gene burden tests to further investigate any potential findings. The plan for question 2 is to perform a Trans-Ancestry Meta Analysis to nominate new risk variants. We will use Plink to perform GWAS is populations that have been defined by genetic ancestry, and then will use MR-MEGA software to meta-analyze the summary statistics in order to nominate new risk variants that may have different effects on disease risk in different ancestry populations.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are two-fold: the first is to nominate genetic variants that effect AD risk in APOE e4 carriers. This is one of many important steps on the journey to precision medicine. It is unlikely that we will find a therapeutic that works for all types of AD and dementia. Instead, we must focus on specific types of disease. By discovering additional genetic modifiers of risk (why do some APOE e4 carriers not get AD?) we can potentially nominate new targets that have a better chance at disease modification. Second, we need to make an active effort as a research community to include non-European populations in genetic research. Much less is known about the genetic basis of AD in non-European populations. We aim to nominate new AD risk variants that are present in multiple and different populations so that we can increase our knowledge and treatment of those populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How effective is treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD) using donepezil, memantine, or both in combination based on the AllofUs dataset? Additionally, how often each of these different treatments administered to the general patient population in terms of sex at birth?
Through answering these questions, more data will be contributed to the existing literature on the effectiveness of these three therapies on a more diverse patient population. Additionally, the relationship between sex at birth and treatment administered to effectively treat the symptoms of AD will be analyzed. This will help determine if there is biased treatment administration based on sex at birth, and could help determine whether a treatment path seems to treat symptoms better depending on sex at birth.","Project Purpose(s)

I anticipate finding that combination therapy is the most effecting treatment for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (based on the literature) and that this therapy is most effective in patients born female at birth. This is the expected outcome because of the literature recently researched, and because Alzheimer's disease occurs more often in females. Researching these questions in the AllofUs, data set will be contributed to the scientific knowledge by showing how these therapies impact a more diverse cohort of patients while also looking into the impact of sex at birth on Alzheimer's disease progression when using 3 different treatment pathways.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am interested in looking at any positive correlation between a history of blood transfusion + later development of Alzheimer's disease; I am working w/ the UKB database to compare data results for validation purposes and potential to correlate to imaging findings. The goal is to identify if there is a potential risk of blood-borne transmission of amyloid-like pathologies, like Alzheimer's. This is a question I developed following a recent JAMA article looking at the correlation between the risk of spontaneous ICHin blood transfusion recipients who received blood from later identified CAA+ patients (something that would not have been known at the time of donation). There is an increased risk of ICH and possible transmission of CAA via blood - given this relationship its possible amyloid-like pathology follows a similar pattern of previously unidentified transmission, especially given that patients who donate may not realize that they later on will develop Alzheimers.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)

Control Set","Scientific Approaches
Datasets will include patients with a history of transfusion w/ and w/o the development of Alzheimer's, and patients with Alzheimer's w/ and w/o a history of both blood donation or transfusion recipients. Then we will analyze for any statistically significant correlation. If correlation is demonstrated we plan to validate against the UKB dataset, if validated we will correlate findings with imaging and polygenic risk stratification data. The big question is more - is there a correlation, if not then we may not move forward with further analysis as it likely wouldn't be indicated.","Anticipated Findings
My hypothesis is that there may be some positive correlation. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is not an identified (as of yet) transmissible element in blood transfusions for amyloid-B pathology, however, those studies have specifically looked for an identifiable element within patients' blood, e.g. some kind of biomarker of Alzhimer's that may indicate a patient's propensity for later development (like measuring high blood pressure as a correlate for increased cardiovascular disease risk). What has not been looked at is the rate or potential relationship between blood donation in presumably healthy patients who later develop Alzheimer's and the risk that their transfused recipients later develop Alzheimer's - this is largely because these diseases are slow progressing, and identification of amyloid-like neuropathology is usually post-mortem or after severe cognitive decline, meaning honestly the data to correlate is emerging.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will integrate genetic data with the electronic health records to analyze the underlying disease pathways. Specifically, we propose to investigate the time-varying effect genetic effect. The specific questions we will ask are:
1.	How does the time-varying genetic effect play a role in late onset Alzheimer’s diseases?
2.	Can we develop a framework to monitoring the potential sign of the late onset Alzheimer’s diseases before it is diagnosed?
3.	Integrated with other lab measurements and brain image resources, can we utilize deep learning to develop a unified system for the detection and prediction of Alzheimer’s diseases?
This study will focus on the statistical methodology development and applications using All of Us data.

We will develop innovative statistical methods based on quantile regressions construct a reference system to monitoring the development of Alzheimer’s diseases. An intuitive idea would be growth chart to monitor the height and weight of a child and give the percentile of him/her in the cohort. By integrating genetic data with electronic health records, such as brain images and recognition tests, we will be able to build a more comprehensive system to describe the patient’s disease progression given the cohort as a reference. This will also help prevent or warn the appearance of the Alzheimer’s at an early stage. Technically speaking, we will use low-rank approximation, data integration, and quantile regression to achieve this goal. We will develop statistical estimation and inference tools to quantify the uncertainty, and illustrate the methods by applications in All of Us data.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to have contributions in statistical methodology and genetics. From a statistical perspective, integrating multi-source data is always a challenging task, due to the errors in the observed data and the heterogeneity caused by unmeasured confounders. We will use quantile regression, a robust way of modeling, to reduce the effect from data heterogeneity, and low-rank approximation, to extract the main feature from different types of the data (e.g., brain images, lab measurements). From a genetic perspective, it is novel and in need to investigating time-varying genetic effect, especially for aging-related diseases. Due to the increasing amount of patients suffered from Alzheimer’s diseases, analyzing the time-varying genetic effect, along with individual-specific EHR data, will greatly unfold the patient’s specific disease progressions and lead to more precise treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Through patient demographic information we will research if certain groups are at higher risk of carrying the APOE-4 gamete, and thus at a higher risk of later developing Alzheimer’s Disease. Similarly, we will compare gamete prevalence against comorbidities. The APOE gene does not affect Alzheimer’s Disease exclusively; it also is known to correlate with high cholesterol, heart disease, and more. From this information we will determine what other diseases or disorders may indicate a person has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. We would also like to research what lifestyle behaviors increase or decrease the risk of developing these APOE-related diseases and disorders.","Anticipated Findings

Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia globally. Furthermore, identifying non-invasive biomarkers through blood samples can revolutionize early detection and management of AD, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare burdens. We aim to explore the data to uncover potential correlations between the intra-microbiome, brain mutations, and blood markers. This exploration is crucial to formalize a research question that can offer insights into the pathogenesis of AD and provide non-invasive diagnostic solutions.
Scientific Questions in this Study:
-Does the intra-microbiome play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in brain tissue?
-Are there detectable mutations in the brain (originating from the ectoderm layer) that are associated with AD, and can these be correlated with markers in blood samples (originating from the mesoderm)?
-Is it possible to identify non-invasive biomarkers for AD based on blood sample analysis using RNA-seq and  WES?","Project Purpose(s)

The heritability of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is estimated between 60-80%, indicating a strong genetic component to susceptibility to AD; which differs between ancestral populations. Although genetic ancestry has been shown to modify an individual’s risk for AD, the majority of genome-wide association studies and models for the calculation of a polygenic risk score have utilized data derived from populations with mostly European ancestry. Furthermore, a well-defined model of an ancestry-informed PRS has yet to be established in admixed populations. We aim to utilize All of Us Research Program data along with data from other studies such as the NIH AD sequencing project to build improved models of AD risk in admixed populations. We hypothesize that an ancestry-informed model for polygenic risk will provide a more accurate representation of AD risk in individuals with admixed genetic ancestry, compared to models that have been built off homogenous ancestral populations.","Project Purpose(s)

Alongside data from other studies, we will use genetic data from the All of Us Research program to evaluate the local ancestry of known genetic risk factors of AD to determine whether risk models in admixed populations improve with the addition of ancestry information. This will be done by mapping local ancestry of known genetic risk factors of AD as well as global (genomic average) proportions of genetic ancestry across the genomes of the participants. We will then leverage AD diagnosis against the composition of local ancestry proportions. These data will be used to build the framework of an ancestry-informed PRS model. We will then employ a meta-analysis framework that has utility in both multiethnic and ethnic-specific analysis utilizing fixed or random effects models and assess phenotypic heterogeneity through Cochran's Q test when comparing prediction accuracy within and across self-identified racial or ethnic categories.","Anticipated Findings
We expect ancestry specific genetic modifiers of AD risk between populations, with risk further modified by proportions of local ancestry spread across the genomes of admixed individuals. Furthermore, we predict that the local ancestry of known genetic modifiers of AD risk differentially influences AD risk when considering global proportions of genetic ancestry as well as non-genetic risk factors of AD such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and social determinants of health. We also predict these data can be leveraged to build an ancestry specific polygenic risk model. We will publish these findings and share the weights used to develop the score (which can be performed in a privacy-preserving fashion) to ensure other parties can leverage our insights and improve biomedical research across AD.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We'll need to study people who have an Alzheimer's diagnosis as well as those who have familial history of the disease, need to learn their current levels of physical activity, current diet and what their day-to-day looks like.

We will utilize the survey and EHR data within the All of Us cohort to explore the social determinants of health, such as food and housing security, and their impact on the five most burdensome neurological disorders in the United States in terms of the absolute number of disability-adjusted life years (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, and epilepsy). We aim to find and understand the risk and protective factors of neurological disorders in diverse populations.
We are interested in understanding:

A large proportion of the human genome is filled with repetitive sequence, including tandem repeats which are short stretches of DNA that are repeated several times in a row. Expansions in tandem repeats can lead to over forty neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We hypothesize that a substantial fraction of previously under-appreciated genetic risk to AD and ALS comes from expansions in additional tandem repeats.  Moreover, the risk of AD is greater in individuals with African ancestry is greater than in individuals of European ancestry. Therefore, we will study tandem repeat length in several populations, including historically underrepresented populations, to ascertain baseline repeat length and sequence composition and search for population-specific tandem repeat expansion events.","Project Purpose(s)

We will compare findings of repeat length with other large cohorts of whole genome sequence data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project and the Answer ALS consortium.","Anticipated Findings
Our goal is to assess tandem repeats prone to expansion to estimate tandem repeat length genome-wide to identify the contribution of novel repeat expansions in disease. Our proposed studies will reveal insight into tandem repeat expansion dynamics and potential novel risk factors for neurodegenerative disease such as AD and ALS.

Treatments for breast and other cancers are often associated with short term cognitive losses. In the long term, however, individuals diagnosed with cancer are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD). The reverse is also true; individuals diagnosed with AD/ADRD are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer. An improved understanding of how the patterns of inverse comorbidity between the two conditions develop and why the patterns exist will give women diagnosed with cancer accurate information about likely cognitive outcomes and reveal mechanisms
(e.g., related to the immune system) that will allow for the reduction of AD/ADRD risk.
It is especially important that the relationship between cancer and AD/ADRD be disentangled in populations that are diverse across a number of dimensions.
We thus propose to evaluate the patterns of cancer and AD/ADRD diagnosis in All of Us, as well as two large population based cohorts.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to conduct initial analyses by generating polygenic risk scores (PRS) for individual participants based on published GWAS risk variants for 18 individual cancer types and Alzheimer's disease.","Anticipated Findings

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia with a huge burden on the society and healthcare system. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States with no effective treatment. Early-onset AD is caused by fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes. Late onset AD is caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors with APOE as the strongest genetic risk factor. However, a significant proportion of the elderly remains cognitively intact despite the presence of amyloid-b, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation. We aim to apply our expertise in genetics, artificial intelligence and molecular cell biology to identify risk and protective genetic variants and their combinations to better evaluate and predict risk, resilience and age-of-onset in Alzheimer's disease.","Project Purpose(s)

We will define and use a cohort of AD cases and controls to identify associations with genetic variants. We will use tools optimized for large-scale analyses, such as PLINK, regenie and FBAT. In particular, we will use family-based approaches to analyze a subset of related individuals. We will perform both: single variant and region-based (for WES and WGS) analyses.  Regions will be selected based on variant impact and/or consecutive windows. Furthermore, we will perform stratification by specific variables of interest, such as ethnicity, sex and APOE, and calculate effect estimates in those groups. We will combine these results with other WGS AD and centenarian datasets in a meta-analysis.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to identify new AD risk and/or protective loci with associated rare and low-frequency variants and stratified genetic associations, such as sex- or APOE- specific AD loci. Such loci associated with AD risk and/or cognitive resilience will be then tested using 3D brain models to characterize functional mechanisms.

We will consider the following questions:
1) Which variants are associated with Alzheimer’s disease?
2) Which variants have different effects on Alzheimer’s disease between sexes?
3) We will narrow down the list of causal variants using state-of-the-art methods.

An antemortem diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) requires costly techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) or invasive methods like measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Other types of dementia like Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) currently have no identified biomarkers comparable to the PET and CSF measures in AD.
Wearable devices have the potential to serve as inexpensive and non-invasive ways to predict dementia type.  Passive collection is also well-suited for elderly individuals, as it avoids relying on subjective recollection and does not interfere with their day-to-day activities.

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)

We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mosaicism of chromosomes is a common condition that becomes more prevalent with advancing age. While this age-related phenomenon has been known for many years, awareness of the potential role of mosaicism in human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancers, and cardiovascular disease, is a more recent development. Recent studies have also demonstrated that mosaicism in hematopoietic cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Based on prior studies, cardiac (atrial) inflammation, and fibrosis can result in disruption of normal atrial conduction and is a powerful predictor of risk for the development and progression of atrial fibrillation.

Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic predisposition variants identified in one population often are not associated with disease risk in another population. We specifically aim to improve polygenic risk scores and disease stratification in diverse populations to improve Alzheimer's disease risk assessments for all populations.

We developed the Polygenic Risk Score Knowledgebase, which enables us to calculate polygenic risk scores based on all genome-wide association studies present in the GWAS Catalog. Importantly, we are then able to contextualize those scores to diverse populations to calculate risk percentiles. We hope to improve Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores across all populations by combining GWAS summary statistics and environmental factors that likely contribute to disease risk. We will also use available data through Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers including the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate improve polygenic risk score calculations for Alzheimer's disease to make the scores less biased and contextualized for different populations. We anticipate that these scores will improv risk stratification for high risk individuals of all populations and enhance clinical trial screenings to better identify control populations from all backgrounds who have lower genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. Improved clinical trial screenings will lead to better therapeutic development and could help develop a more generalized cure for Alzheimer's disease that can help all populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Individuals included in the study cohort will be from both sexes, any ethnicity, and at least 60 years old. The first group will be selected based on the APO E4/E4 genotype, which increases the risk by approximately eight to twelvefold.

The genetic etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is poorly understood. Somatic mutations in the brains with AD and other neurological disorders have been established as a potential mechanism for their pathophysiology. Somatic transposable elements (TEs) are prevalent in individual neurons in the human brain's cerebral cortex, a region long associated with AD progression. Recent work has shown a connection between AD-associated Tau protein-mediated mechanisms with TE activity and somatic mutations. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated TE's role and genomic impact in AD and related dementias in the survey of large-scale cohorts. In this proposal, we aim to employ a genome-wide scan to explore the functional impact of TE in AD and related dementias by leveraging the genomic and phenotypic data in All of Us dataset.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our research question is: How does exposure to adverse social and natural environmental conditions impact human health outcomes through epigenetic changes? Subsequent questions are: In which populations do we see the highest associations between exposure and epigenetic changes? In which populations do we see the highest associations between epigenetic changes and poor health outcomes? To what extent do we see these epigenetic changes being reversed, and what lifestyle factors are associated with that?
This research will have key implications for chronic disease: a top cause of mortality in vulnerable U.S populations. This paper explores the mechanisms by which the SDOH impact health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms have been closely linked cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease–the three chronic diseases with the highest prevalence globally. Specifically, studying inflammation in the genotype dataset will connect this research directly to chronic disease.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The goal of this project is to uncover novel early biomarkers and generate prediction models for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on race/ethnicity or dietary habits. The hypothesis is that metabolic dysfunction and diet-associated health issues are predictors for cognitive impairment in a race/ethnicity-specific manner. We propose using medical data obtained from 6 University of California Medical Centers to generate prediction models for AD development based on metabolic disease diagnoses and clinical test results, differentiating by race and ethnicity as well as gender. The long-term objective is to aggressively treat and prevent metabolic diseases prevalent among differing ethnicities, leading to AD prevention.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease and Liver diseases)","Scientific Approaches
The inclusion criteria are patients who are 65-95 years old with and without AD based on ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases).
Diseases that affect liver functions (alcoholic, toxic, failure, chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, inflammation, malignancy, i.e., liver cancer of any types, autoimmune, Wilson’s Disease), Type 2 diabetes melilotus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, as well as nicotine or alcohol dependence will be included for risk predictions. Demographic data and clinical tests that will be included are birth sex, BMI, age at menopause (or hot flash symptom, hemoglobin A1C, glucose blood/urine tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, plasma viscosity, liver function panels, comprehensive metabolic panels, blood count, lipid panels, urinalysis, C reactive protein, and prothrombin time to generate prediction models. All of those are possible indicators of metabolic dysfunction.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to generate good prediction models and to be able to quantify the importance of metabolic clinical features for AD identification. If the learned model is not sufficiently accurate on held-back data, we will retrain the models from scratch using more domain knowledge to reduce the complexity of the prediction tasks. We will also explore the possibility of using a similar dataset to pre-train a model or to select appropriate features. If the data does not match with the known National data, we will look into patient population and barriers to access within the UC system. The benchmarks for success are measured by: (1) the identification of disparities in AD as well as metabolic diseases in the UC system; (2) the generation of good models for predicting AD based on race and ethnicity.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In addition, we will apply methods described in the MIST software and compare with standard statistical methods using the AD datasets in All of Us.

Itch is a common clinical phenomenon which worsens with age, and up to one-third of elderly patients report clinically significant itch with moderate impact on their quality of life. Itch and neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease are also significantly associated in aging humans. For example, bullous pemphigoid – a pruritic autoimmune skin disorder whose incidence rises with age – increases the odds of dementia by 10-fold (95% confidence interval 5.4-17.8]). The association between age-related non-neoplastic skin conditions and neurological disorders can be due to shared risk factors (e.g., aging, exposure) or upstream pathophysiology (systemic inflammation, inflammaging), but studies dissecting these potential mechanistic relationships are lacking. In this study, I intend to evaluate the association between dementia and pruritus in an aging population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (dementia)","Scientific Approaches
I will use descriptive statistics to characterize pruritic skin diseases in patients with and without dementia including demographic information, inflammatory skin diseases, dementia subtypes, other comorbid medical conditions, and use of specific medications that have been associated with the development of dementia in prior literature (e.g. sedating anti-histamines). I will use basic statistical techniques to assess these relationships including chi-squared analyses, t-tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear multivariable linear regression models.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that these analyses will demonstrate an association between dementia and pruritus, measured by presence/absence of pruritic inflammatory skin diseases.

At this point in time the a priori hypothesis is that SGM individuals will have a poorer psychosocial health and well-being than their CGH comparators. When we finish this work we hope that this will generate information that will spark further inquiry and opportunities to conduct studies to better understand and address any disparities that are identified among SGM individuals with PD/ADRD.
Further, descriptive analyses that examine data in the aggregate as well disaggregated data (by groups) and using analyses that allow us to account for intersecting marginalized identities are important for understanding which groups are at greatest risk for poor outcomes. We we anticipate that differences to exist in both the combined and disaggregated analyses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We will analyze the potential different mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease, using parameters including medicines from EHR records, genetic backgrounds, questionnaires, blood test lab parameters, etc.
Specific questions we will ask are:
1. How the points of AD patients are presented in the high-dimension space? Are there any cluster structures? Is it possible to reduce the dimensions?
2. What are the high dimension structures of the age/sex mapping controls related to AD patients?
3. If we identified some clusters in point1, what’s the potential contributions of aging to different clusters. Is it possible to predict AD risks for certain clusters for the younger population?
They are hundreds of potential factors that are associated with AD. We hypothesis that some of those factors shared the same pathological pathways, and thus would cluster in the high dimension space. We expected to conclude some relative independent major driven factors for AD.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Alzheimer's disease)","Scientific Approaches
We will apply algorithms developed at Columbia University and in the OHDSI network to All of Us data to find medication sequences. We will use Python and BigQuery to (1) retrieve AD patients and the HER, questionnaires and Genomic information. (2) Filter the data with AD risk factors and visualize their structures in high dimensional space. (3) Clustering the data using various clustering and dimensional reduction methods to check potential clusters; (4) Analyzing contribution factors to each potential clusters. (5) Analyzing the structure of cognitive normal subjects with similar AD risk factors. We will engage community partners to review our hypotheses, approach, and study limitations. Limitations include: 1. medication reports may not tell us how well people adhered to their prescribed therapy; 2. High heterogeneity and relative small sample size in the data might result in biased clusters.","Anticipated Findings
For this study, we expect to show several distinct clusters in AD patients, which may due to different pathological mechanisms in AD which require different therapeutic strategies. We expect to find (1) subtypes of AD; (2) potential contribution factors to different subtypes; (3) effect size of different risk factors to different subtypes; (4)potential predictive model to AD; (5) and potential therapeutic strategies to different AD sub types. Importantly, the detailed code developed will be made available within the Researcher Workbench, so other researchers may more easily repeat our study or applie similar research strategies to other diseases. We believe this approach will be useful in many discovery studies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program.

Delirium, a severe medical condition prevalent among older patients, is often linked to various risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), potentially due to shared mechanisms increasing dementia susceptibility. Intriguingly, research suggests that metformin, a medication for DM, not only extends lifespan but also reduces delirium risk in DM patients. Additionally, exploring metformin's effects on genome-wide DNA methylation have shed light on its mechanisms, including pathways related to longevity, AMPK, inflammation, and HIF-1 alpha. However, a deeper understanding of metformin's role in longevity and its impact on delirium risk is warranted. To address this gap, our study aims to investigate metformin's potential influence on delirium risk as well as mortality risk, and also investigate genetic profiles modulating such potential association by examining genome-wide genetic status in patients with and without a history of delirium.","Project Purpose(s)

- Investigate the prevalence of delirium among individuals with and without a history of metformin use, stratified by the status for diabetes mellitus.
- Compare the frequency of SNP alleles related to delirium as a trait among the population first. Then we evaluate the difference of such potential association between participants who have used metformin and those who have not to investigate the potential interaction between genotype and medical use history.","Anticipated Findings
Conducting the described research study could yield several anticipated findings that can contribute significantly to the field of delirium, pharmacogenomics, and the potential interaction between medication use and genetic predispositions. Findings may reveal a lower prevalence of delirium among individuals with a history of metformin use compared to those without such a history, particularly among those with diabetes mellitus. In addition, findings might indicate a differential effect of metformin on individuals with different genetic predispositions towards delirium. Overall, the anticipated findings from this research study could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between metformin use, genetic factors, and the pathophysiology of delirium, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical care, risk assessment, and potentially the development of targeted interventions for preventing or managing delirium in at-risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

(i) Which specific genetic variants predispose people to being more vulnerable to delirium?
(ii) Which modifiable risk factors and circulating proteins affect risk of delirium?
(iii) Is delirium a cause and/or consequence of dementia and frailty?
Delirium is an acute neurocognitive disorder that affects up to 50% of hospitalized patients over the age of 65. Delirium can be thought of as 'acute brain failure,' with serious consequences for patients including longer hospital stays and greater risk of cognitive and functional decline, and death. It remains unclear if delirium is an early sign of dementia/frailty or a modifiable mediator. There is a need to improve current prevention and treatment strategies, which starts with a better understanding of the underlying risk factors and biological mechanisms precipitating delirium. Genetic studies may help offer new insights into pathogenesis, help disentangle complex relationships with dementia and frailty, and uncover novel drug targets.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (delirium)
Drug Development
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
First, we will characterize the association between common (MAF>0.005) genetic variants and delirium status (any history of hospitalized delirium episode) by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within each ancestry using a logistic mixed model (SAIGE) and adjusting for age, sex, and top genetic principal components. Results from ancestry-specific GWAS will be combined via meta-analysis (MANTRA and METAL). Second, using the resulting summary statistics, we will perform Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to identify putative mediators of delirium including (a) modifiable risk factors (e.g. physical activity) and (b) druggable circulating proteins (e.g. inflammatory cytokines). Third, MR will also be used to assess potential bidirectional relationships between delirium vs. dementia and frailty. Finally, to corroborate genes identified by GWAS, rare variant association testing will be conducted testing rare mutation burden of each gene with delirium status (SAIGE-GENE) .","Anticipated Findings
Some individuals may have more fragile vs. resilient brains as a result of genetic predisposition. For example, it is known that homozygote APOE ε4 carriers are at four-fold elevated risk of delirium but beyond the APOE locus, no other genetic variations have been consistently associated despite strong estimated heritability. Accordingly, our study will contribute to identifying novel genetic risk factors for delirium. It will also help prioritize causal modifiable risk factors to help better inform public health policies for prevention in the elderly. This study will also help better elucidate the mechanisms and specific circulating proteins mediating risk of delirium, which may lead to the development of the first effective pharmacotherapies to treat delirium. Finally, GWAS results could be operationalized into polygenic risk scores which could complement and enhance existing clinical risk prediction models for delirium by capturing an innate component of brain vulnerability.","Demographic Categories of Interest

However, AC medications can sometimes lead to problems like confusion, memory loss, and falls in older individuals. Therefore, it's important to develop tools that can help doctors estimate a person's AC medication use and predict their risk of experiencing these side effects. A tool called the AC Medication Index (ACMI) was recently developed using the UK 'Connected Bradford' general practice database. This tool helps identify patients at high risk of experiencing side effects from AC medications, such as delirium or falls. We are now using this tool to study the connection between AC medication use and dementia using the UK Biobank and All of Us Research Program data.","Project Purpose(s)

We are utilizing the UK Biobank which is a large population-based prospective cohort study with comprehensive genetic and phenotypic data, that includes linked primary health care records for ~230,000 participants. We are using cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for clinical and genetic factors, to quantify the association between baseline annual anticholinergic burden (computed using the ACMI, among other anticholinergic burden scales) and the risk of dementia. Additionally, we are using PLINK to create a genetic risk score based on genes involved in the Acetylcholine signalling pathway, with the UK Biobank as the base cohort. This score will be tested using data from the All of Us Research Program, which will be the test cohort.","Anticipated Findings

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide. However, about half of cancer cases are preventable as they are linked to modifiable risk factors. The identification of individuals at high risk for cancer can help enhance the efficiency of cancer screening and develop effective cancer prevention programs. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly used for cancer prediction, including the prediction of cancer susceptibility (i.e., risk assessment), with acceptable performance reported before. However, few studies have explored cancer risk prediction for people with multimorbidity, including those with cognitive impairment such as dementia, who face challenges in health self-management and care decision-making. Research questions of this study are focused on (1) what are high-ranked risk factors for breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers? (2) how do these risk factors differ between people with dementia (and/or mild cognitive impairment) and those without?","Project Purpose(s)

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)

Iron has essential biological functions but too much can result in the iron overload disease hemochromatosis. This is predominantly caused by mutations in the HFE gene, especially the p.C282Y genetic variant. However, patients experience dramatically different disease trajectories, and we have studied factors influencing outcomes in the UK Biobank (PMIDs: 30651232 & 35567766), including the first report that those with two copies of this mutation have increased risk of dementia (doi:10.3233/jad-201080). Yet whether this extends to other populations is unknown. We aim to study participants with combinations of the HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D variants in the All of Us cohort to characterise penetrance of these iron overload associated genetic variants to key outcomes (liver disease, dementia) plus investigate modifiers of the penetrance, including non-HFE genetic variants known to increase iron levels, plus obesity, and other risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

Health outcomes will be ascertained from the OMOP data, especially liver disease (the severe clinical outcome of iron overload) but also dementia. We will use `Plink` to extract genotype information, and `R` to perform the statistical analyses. We will utilize the following participant information, where available, to characterise the genotype carriers and include as risk factors/covariates: age, sex, obesity, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.","Anticipated Findings

We anticipate clarifying the effect of risk factors in the other (contested) genotype combination (such as C282Y-H63D compound heterozygotes).

Then we use random forest to rank the importance of individual variables such as SNPs or household income as a screening criterion in variable selection. The key and transformative feature of our methods is that it can consider and then select from additive effects and a broad range of interactions among a large number of variables without the need to define the interactions ahead of time, allowing for more careful evaluation of the selected interactions once they are identified as viable candidates.","Anticipated Findings

We will have an opportunity to evaluate systematically the interactions of genes and SDoH on health and inequalities of health. e.g., the apparently diminished effect of ε4 on dementia risk among African Americans.

CADASIL is a slow onset, rare genetic disease caused by NOTCH3 gene variants, leading to lesions in the white matter of the brain, migraines, recurrent strokes and dementia/memory loss. Not only is CADASIL genotypically diverse (variants span the whole gene), it is also phenotypically heterogeneous with individuals that have the same variant presenting with very different symptoms as well as variable diseases progression. Lastly, current treatments are palliative and there is little prospect of future therapies to directly address causation and block progression of the disease.
We hypothesize that this heterogeneity is partially driven by risk factors, lifestyle, environmental components and genetic modifiers. This database will enable us to identify the frequency and the distribution of NOTCH3 variants in the enrolled population as well as use available demographic, lifestyle and genetic data to parse out potential disease modifiers that may alter the course of CADASIL.","Project Purpose(s)

Advances in the ability to predict disease using genetics have been enabled by large genome wide association studies and methods that can combine multiple genetic risk factors such as polygenic risk scores (PRS). The predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores for dementia has predominantly been studied in cohorts where phenotypes have been defined by autopsy or strict clinical diagnostic criteria. In practice, healthcare providers diagnose dementia during life without reviewing strict diagnostic criteria. Healthcare provider inform patients of their diagnosis and/or enter these diagnoses in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition, many polygenic risk dementia studies have been performed in individuals of European ancestry. Our objective is to evaluate polygenic risk scores for dementia based on phenotypes from the EHR among different ancestry groups. Improving genetic predictive models of dementia can aid in early diagnosis and treatment of dementias.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Using the All of Us genetic and clinical data, we will use a case control design where cases are defined by the dementia or related phenotype and controls are adults without those phenotypes. We will compute polygenic risk scores using methods such as LDPRED2. We will also consider PRS using multiple neurodegenerative diseases, PRS different genetic ancestries, and utilizing advanced machine learning models. We will evaluate the accuracy of these PRS to predict cases. We will control and stratify results by variables including age, sex, known genetic risk factors such as APOE and MAPT haplotype, and self-reported and genetic ancestry.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to develop and test genetic models that have high accuracy to predict dementia and related phenotypes with high accuracy in European and non-European genetic ancestries. These models can be validated in different cohorts and improve the early diagnosis and treatment of dementias .","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this project is twofold: (1) to explore the relationship between biopsychosocial (i.e., physical, mental, psychosocial), and neurocognitive impairment, and factors associated with healthcare access and utilization among older people living with HIV (PLWH) and (2) to evaluate the primary genetic markers of dementia among older PLWH. This project seeks to:
1. Assess the relationships between social position, ART characteristics by age at diagnosis, and cognitive characteristics among older PLWH.
2. Examine the relationships between social position, cognitive characteristics, healthcare access and utilization (insurance, type of provider, affordability, provide demographics) among older PLWH.
3. Elucidate the frequency of the APOE4 and TREM2 genes (genetic markers of dementia) among older PLWH.","Project Purpose(s)

We will utilize the controlled tier of the most recent dataset to examine these relationships. For the first aim, descriptive statistics will be calculated for the physical, mental, cognitive, sociodemographic, ART, and time of diagnosis characteristics in addition to the responses from the questions included the in the Health Care Access & Utilization survey. Bivariate analyses will then be conducted to determine the independent associations between physical, mental, sociodemographic, and ART characteristics, stratified by age of diagnosis, current age (50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+), and cognitive status (impairment vs. non-impairment). Multiple logistic regressions will be conducted to model the different relationships between the physical, mental, sociodemographic, and ART characteristics, stratified by current age, age of diagnosis, and cognitive status. Interactions will also be tested. We will also examine the frequency of the APOE4 and TREM2 genes.","Anticipated Findings
Hypothesis 1:  Older PLWHA and those living with HIV longer will have more adverse biopsychosocial and cognitive health challenges compared to those who were more recently diagnosed and younger.
Hypothesis 2: Those who are more disadvantaged based on sociodemographic classification will have more adverse biopsychosocial and cognitive health challenges and will not be as engaged in ART.
Hypothesis 3 Older PLWHA and those living with HIV longer will access and utilize healthcare more frequently than those who were more recently diagnosed and younger.

I hope to answer whether speech/gait profiles can differentiate dementia types. The escalating pervasiveness of dementia has placed a huge burden on the health and social care systems, making accurate identification of dementia crucial. The differential identification of dementia types in clinical settings relies heavily on the combination of expensive neuroimaging panel and invasive biomarker testing, which makes it difficult to apply such exams to every person with cognitive complaints. In addition, similar cognitive symptoms among these dementia types leave clinicians to the challenging task of differentiating the type of dementia. The analysis of speech/gait markers may lead to the development of a non-invasive and cost-efficient tool for differential diagnosis of dementia. This will assist healthcare professionals in identifying the ever-increasing cognitive conditions to facilitate the development of appropriate treatments and managements plans, tailored to each type of dementia.","Project Purpose(s)

We expect to find distinct differences between Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital and dementia patients admitted to hospital with an acute Covid-19 diagnosis. In many cases, dementia patients have preexisting damage to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) due to a chronic state of inflammation, allowing the viral particles direct access to the brain (Wang et al., 2021). SARS-Cov2 has been shown to induce the release of cytokines IL1, IL-16, TNF-α, exacerbating inflammation and causing further injury to the BBB (Fotuhi et al., 2020). Entry of viral particles and blood material into the CSF can result in thrombotic events, seizures, and encephalitis, all of which can lead to fatal outcomes (Wang et al., 2021). This leaves patients with dementia extremely vulnerable to the development of inflammatory cytokine storms and hypercoagulation cascades common in COVID-19.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The project aims to investigate the prevalence and occurrence rate of women having a high body mass index during pregnancy who have a high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in the U.S. population concerning the variety present within the United States including age groups, races, ethnicities, geographical regions, education level, and income level. This study will demonstrate the association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during the later stages of pregnancy and also explore the impact at various levels of maternal BMI on the development of GDM among pregnant women in the later stages of pregnancy. This will help to promote health equity among different demographic and clinical subgroups provide endorsement and potential guidance to scientists and clinical management and optimize patient care in the U.S. population.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use the All of Us study, controlled tire dataset v7. Participants with a high BMI will be identified based on WHO cutoffs. The eligibility criteria are based on females assigned at birth, aged 18-49 years who are pregnant. The prevalence of participants will be estimated by subpopulation based on age groups, races, ethnicities, geographical regions, education level, and income level. The dataset will be checked for normality, descriptive characteristics[For continuous: median (IQR) and for categorical n(%)], and association.will be established. The Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated by using binomial regression for all GDM individuals. P-value<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.","Anticipated Findings
The study may identify specific thresholds or categories of maternal BMI during pregnancy that are related to higher or lower risks of developing GDM in the later stages of pregnancy. So, it can contribute to risk stratification and help in developing the goal interventions for high-risk individuals.
The findings enhance the timing of BMI assessment during pregnancy concerning GDM risk.
Moreover, this work may reveal the potential impact of maternal BMI during pregnancy on neonatal health outcomes and It is expected that maternal BMI levels associated with increased GDM risk may also be linked to adverse neonatal outcomes. The anticipated findings could have important clinical implications for prenatal care and GDM management. Healthcare providers may use the results to inform risk assessment protocols and develop personalized care plans for pregnant women based on their BMI status.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to study chronic disease multimorbidity (the presence of multiple conditions) among a diverse population of participants in the All of Us Research Program. Chronic disease is a rising contributor to mortality and morbidity, and many chronic disease risk factors are modifiable. Learning how we can more effectively prevent and control chronic disease among diverse patient populations will be essential for population health improvement.

Hundreds of genetic variants have been linked with diabetes and related metabolic conditions, including for obesity, type-two diabetes, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin).. However, the biological pathways by which they act is not yet clear, nor have all causal genetic variants been identified, especially those in the fewest individuals. We intend to run genome-wide association studies between these phenotypes (e.g. individuals who suffer from diabetes versus those who do not, or BMI as a continuous trait), and other diabetes-related phenotypes (HbA1c, glucose etc) against genetic variants from the Whole Genome Sequencing data. Our results will improve the field’s understanding of the biological pathways for these conditions. The All of Us data set is crucial for answering these questions, due to its diverse genetic ancestry.

Delirium, a severe medical condition prevalent among older patients, is often linked to various risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), potentially due to shared mechanisms increasing dementia susceptibility. Intriguingly, research suggests that metformin, a medication for DM, not only extends lifespan but also reduces delirium risk in DM patients. Additionally, exploring metformin's effects on genome-wide DNA methylation have shed light on its mechanisms, including pathways related to longevity, AMPK, inflammation, and HIF-1 alpha. However, a deeper understanding of metformin's role in longevity and its impact on delirium risk is warranted. To address this gap, our study aims to investigate metformin's potential influence on delirium risk as well as mortality risk, and also investigate genetic profiles modulating such potential association by examining genome-wide genetic status in patients with and without a history of delirium.","Project Purpose(s)

- Investigate the prevalence of delirium among individuals with and without a history of metformin use, stratified by the status for diabetes mellitus.
- Compare the frequency of SNP alleles related to delirium as a trait among the population first. Then we evaluate the difference of such potential association between participants who have used metformin and those who have not to investigate the potential interaction between genotype and medical use history.","Anticipated Findings
Conducting the described research study could yield several anticipated findings that can contribute significantly to the field of delirium, pharmacogenomics, and the potential interaction between medication use and genetic predispositions. Findings may reveal a lower prevalence of delirium among individuals with a history of metformin use compared to those without such a history, particularly among those with diabetes mellitus. In addition, findings might indicate a differential effect of metformin on individuals with different genetic predispositions towards delirium. Overall, the anticipated findings from this research study could enhance our understanding of the complex relationship between metformin use, genetic factors, and the pathophysiology of delirium, ultimately leading to improvements in clinical care, risk assessment, and potentially the development of targeted interventions for preventing or managing delirium in at-risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are commonly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, the response rate is relatively low.

We believe gene/drug interactions with medicines used to treat chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes and COPD) may also associate with response of NSCLC to ICI.

Common metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) are influenced by both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, physical activity, and sleep duration). Understanding both genetic and non-genetic factors and their interactions may provide insights into potential pharmacologic targets and further lay the scientific foundation for precision interventions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can characterize the genetic effects on complex diseases. The All of Us Research Program  offers an excellent path forward to use GWAS to elucidate human disease drivers. In response to FNIH RFP2 “GENERATION of New genetic, -omic, or biomarker data for Common Metabolic Diseases,” we propose to generate and discover novel genetic associations in the All of Us Research Program.","Project Purpose(s)

We will report counts and power calculations that describe the genetic associations that could be discovered in the All of Us Cohort. We will explore the availability of additional common metabolic diseases and complications and perform power calculations for these traits. We will perform genetic association analyses with each disease and outcome (type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and NAFLD).","Anticipated Findings

This study aims to integrate polygenic scores and pharmacogenetics to investigate drug interactions, enhancing personalized medicine. Polygenic scores, summarizing genetic predispositions for peripheral biomarkers or disease risk factors, combined with pharmacogenetic data—how genetic variation affects drug response—can offer insights into individual drug efficacy and safety. We focus on statins, hypertensive drugs, and hyperglycemic agents. For instance, specific genetic variants influence statin metabolism, potentially causing side effects like myopathy. Similarly, genetic factors affect hypertensive drug efficacy, such as beta-blockers in individuals with certain genotypes showing less blood pressure reduction. For hyperglycemic drugs, genetic variations can predict response to metformin, guiding optimal diabetes management. This research will elucidate genetic factors underlying drug interactions, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
Our research will utilize large-scale genomic datasets in All of Us with genetic profiles and detailed medication histories. We'll analyze polygenic scores—aggregated from millions of genetic variants associated with clinical biomarkers —and pharmacogenetic markers relevant to drug metabolism and efficacy. For statins, hypertensive, and hyperglycemic drugs, we'll examine specific genetic markers that modulate drug metabolism enzymes (e.g., CYP450 variants) and transporters (e.g., SLCO1B1 for statins). Tools like Hail for working with large genomics datasets, statsmodels in Python for statistical analysis and machine learning, and PharmGKB database for pharmacogenetics information will be pivotal.","Anticipated Findings
Our goal is to understand if integrating polygenics with pharmacogenetics can identify patients who would benefit from tailored or alternative therapies. For example, consider integrating a polygenic score for LDL cholesterol with a pharmacogenomic alleles in SLCO1B1. Polygenic scores aggregate the effects of numerous genetic variants associated with LDL cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, the SLCO1B1 gene encodes a liver transporter protein that significantly influences statin drug metabolism; certain variants in this gene are linked to increased risk of statin-induced myopathy. For individuals with a high polygenic score for LDL cholesterol, indicating a genetic predisposition to high LDL levels, statins might be essential for managing cardiovascular risk. However, if these individuals also carry a risk allele in SLCO1B1, they might be at a higher risk for adverse reactions from standard statin doses.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Over half of all American adults ≥18 years of age are living with one or more chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many experience multiple symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, depressed mood, anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath) either related to the chronic condition and/or its treatment. Symptom clusters are defined as two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Symptom clusters are challenging to manage and burden both the patient and healthcare system. However, symptom clusters in chronic conditions are understudied and poorly understood. We believe that we can generate new knowledge to improve patient symptom management by using All of Us data. We plan to perform data-driven characterization of symptom clusters in patients diagnosed with one or more chronic conditions and explore predictors (e.g., clinical, genetic, and environmental biomarkers) of different symptom clusters.","Project Purpose(s)

Diabetes stands as one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases, exerting a disproportionate impact on both sex and racial/ethnic minority populations. While numerous studies have investigated the correlation between social determinants of health and diabetes, a significant gap persists in our comprehension of the most pertinent factors within the intricate landscape of social determinants of health datasets related to diabetes.
1)	What are the primary social determinants of health factors associated with diabetes across diverse populations?
2)	How do these factors vary in their impact on diabetes within specific sex and race/ethnicity groups?
By addressing these pivotal questions, our research endeavors to refine our understanding of the complex relationship between social determinants of health and diabetes outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
To address this gap, there is a critical need for sophisticated computational modeling, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms capable of handling high-dimensional data in large datasets, to account for social determinants of health  factors in diabetes. We will use supervised ML approaches to examine the associations of individual health factors and neighborhood factors in relation to Diabetes . The supervised ML approach is appropriate because it seeks patterns in the training data and uses that information to make predictions for unseen data without relying on strict model distributions. Four different tree-based machine learning algorithms including: 1) Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, 2) Decision Tree, 3) Random tree, and 4) Gradient Boosting Machines (gbm) will be used to compare their performance in predicting the risk of Diabetes. The root mean squared error and sensitivity analysis will serve as primary indicators of predictive accuracy.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated outcomes of our study hold the promise of making significant strides in comprehending and mitigating health disparities among minority populations, with a specific focus on predicting the risk of diabetes. We envisage that the development of a predictive framework will play a pivotal role in identifying the key determinants of diabetes.
We anticipate two distinct outcomes from our research: Firstly, we aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between neighborhood environmental factors and diabetes. This understanding will contribute substantially to the refinement of targeted interventions and strategies for the prediction of race/ethnicity- and sex-specific risks associated with diabetes.

Metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MASLD represents a spectrum of liver pathology ranging from simple steatosis to metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, commonly used in the management of T2DM, have shown promise in improving metabolic parameters and possibly influencing hepatic outcomes in MASLD. However, the long-term effects of these medications on HCC incidence in patients with MASLD remain unclear. This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following the use of GLP-1 agonists in patients diagnosed with steatotic liver disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hepatocellular carcinoma)","Scientific Approaches
Data Source: AllofUs participants diagnosed with fatty liver disease/steatotic liver disease and prescribed GLP-1 agonists between TBD dates.
Study Population: Patients aged 18 years and above with a diagnosis of fatty liver disease (MASLD, MASH, NAFLD or NASH) confirmed via imaging or histology, who have been prescribed GLP-1 agonists for at least one year during the study period.
Outcome Measure: The primary outcome is the incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients exposed to GLP-1 agonists compared to those not exposed.
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will summarize baseline characteristics. The incidence of HCC will be calculated per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for potential confounders.","Anticipated Findings
This study hypothesizes that GLP-1 agonists may have a protective effect against the development of HCC in patients with fatty liver disease due to their metabolic benefits. However, there is also a possibility that GLP-1 agonists may influence hepatic carcinogenesis through alternative mechanisms. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the long-term hepatocellular outcomes associated with the use of GLP-1 agonists in patients with fatty liver disease. Understanding the potential impact of GLP-1 agonists on hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in patients with fatty liver disease is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies in this population. The findings from this study may inform clinical decision-making and contribute to the growing body of evidence on the role of GLP-1 agonists in liver-related outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), a highly polygenic disease, has been progressively increasing to epidemic proportions. We are constructing risk prediction tools for T2D and complications that could help guide clinicians implement personalized screening and management approaches to prevent T2D and complications. The integration of polygenic risk scores (PRS) into risk prediction models enhances the performance of these models. Yet the T2D prediction models that consider both clinical risks and T2D PRS fail to account for the underlying heterogeneous pathophysiology of T2D.
We hypothesize that classification models, trained on a large data set and validated on a diverse group of patients, that exhaust the genetic risk for the pathologies involved in T2D development along with the clinical and environmental risk factors will provide more accurate predictions and guide individualized interventions to prevent both T2D and its multiple complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
Our hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims:
Aim 1. To develop a classification model for predicting T2D based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
After identifying individuals with T2D as well as all relevant clinical and lifestyle risk factors and calculating the PRS for T2D and relevant risk factors, we will use a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm for classification. We will then select the top features associated with the disease and use them to build a simplified prediction model.
Aim 2. To develop classification models for predicting T2D complications based on genetic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors.
We will identify people with T2D microvascular (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy) and macrovascular (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease) complications. Multiple PRS for risk factors of each complication, T2D PRS, and the targeted complication PRS will be integrated into the classification model.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study will improve risk prediction by taking account of the genetic risks of the underlying pathologies involved in the development of T2D and complications as well as the clinical and lifestyle risk factors. We except the classification models for T2D and complication to achieve high predictability in diverse populations. We expect to determine the key risk factors for T2D complications and use them to build simplified focused classification models that will help clinicians make person-centered screening and management decisions to prevent complications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genetic studies have focused almost exclusively on excess risk for poor health, yet there is considerable ethnic heterogeneity in African derived populations such that not all Black/African Americans (B/AA) have poor type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated comorbidities. Variants in the engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) gene have been previously associated with protection against end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) due to T2D in a B/AA case-control cohort. Leak et al. (Ann Hum Genet. 2009; 73(2):152-9) performed the first comprehensive evaluation of variations across ELMO1 gene in a large B/AA T2D-ESRD case-control population and identified that the minor allele of four intronic variants showed protection, with odds ratios between 0.77-0.84.

Tests of association under the three a priori genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) will be reported. T2D-ESRD phenotypes (microalbuminuria, eGFR, creatinine, etc) will be performed using a series of analysis of variance.

Aim 2: What is the relationship between the screening practices and limb amputation in patients with diabetes and concomitant peripheral artery disease?
Aim 3: What factors influence practice decisions to amputate a lower limb in Black and nonblack patients in the United States?
Rationale: Evidence suggests that Black patients have a higher prevalence of asymptomatic PAD and are less aware of symptoms. This issue collectively puts them at increased risk for a delay in care. Black persons diagnosed with chronic kidney disease in midlife ages (45-64) while white persons were diagnosed with kidney disease in later life (65-74), partially attributable to better access to control diabetes.

Based on CDC reporting,6 9% (an estimated 18,180 of the AoU records), of persons with Type II diabetes also will have PAD, and of these 4.6% (an estimated 836 of the AoU records) will possibly have a limb amputation. These are adequately large numbers to support statistical analyses of the proposed hypotheses.","Anticipated Findings
H1A: A decrease in the documentation of screening for PAD will be associated with a higher rate of limb amputations among Black patients compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
H1B: A decrease in the documentation of screening for PAD will be associated with a higher rate of limb amputations in Black patients with diabetes less than 45 years of age compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
H2: An increase in the documentation of vascular treatment services will be associated with a decrease in limb amputations at all stages of diabetes with concomitant PAD.
H3: An increase in the documentation of screening for PAD using an ankle brachial index (ABI) will be associated with a decrease in rate of limb amputations.
H4: An increase in documentation of adherence to the American Heart Association Clinical Practice Guidelines for critical limb ischemia will be associated with a decrease in the rate of limb amputations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults in the US. In 2021, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy reached 26.43% in the US. The random survival forest, a machine learning method, is a robust prediction approach. However, its accuracy in predicting the development of diabetic retinopathy compared to the traditional Cox proportional hazards regression method remains unclear. Our aims are to:
(a)	Identify risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
(b)	Develop a random survival forest model to predict the onset of diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM
(c)	Develop a Cox proportional hazards regression model to predict the onset of diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM
(d)	Compare random survival forest and Cox proportional hazards regression models in predicting the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM","Project Purpose(s)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Retrospectively, we will construct a cohort of individuals with T2DM and follow up the cohort for the development of diabetic retinopathy, including non-proliferative, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema. We will extract data on demographic and clinical information, blood glucose control, blood pressure control, and lipid control for this cohort. Then we will use logistic regression to identify risk factors for diabetic retinopathy using cohort data. Subsequently, we will use risk factors along with the cohort data to train and test prediction models, which include Cox proportional hazards regression model and random survival forest model. For the random survival forest model, we will find the optimal set of hyperparameters using k-fold cross validation and grid search cross-validation. Finally, we will compare the predictive performance of the models using the Harrell’s C-index and the integrated Brier score.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that variables such as diabetes duration, fasting blood glucose, hypertension, total cholesterol are risk factors for diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, we anticipate that the random survival forest model will outperform the Cox proportional hazards regression model in predicting the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with T2DM. By leveraging the big data from the All of Us Research Program and applying machine learning technology, we will develop an accurate prediction model that can facilitate the identification of individuals with high risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The main scientific purpose of my study is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can consider genetic, lifestyle and clinical data of participants to predict response to antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat schizophrenia, depression and other diseases. Only around 40% of schizophrenia patients respond to antipsychotics, and moreover they may experience severe side effects such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and weight gain. Personalizing prescription of antipsychotics according to the patient's specific characteristics may result in safer and more effective treatment. As predicting treatment response is complex and involves multiple different factors, the All of Us cohort provides a unique opportunity to study all these factors and use them to create a ML algorithm.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I plan on exploring the All of Us dataset to identify the number of participants taking antipsychotics, and the ways in which drug response can be defined for them. It will be important to have long-term response data for the participants. Once a cohort has been created, I will analyze it using machine learning tools such as support vector machines and random forest, which are supervised machine learning methods. Supervised machine learning describes ML methods that are fed data with labels. For example, the algorithm will take the genetic information of a participant, pre-labeled as ""responder"" or ""non-responder"". The algorithm will then learn what distinguishes responders from non-responders. These ML methods can be used to combine the predictive effect of multiple variables.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that if a machine learning algorithm with decent predictive ability is created, the next step is to validate the algorithm on different populations outside of the All of Us cohort. Once the algorithm has been validated, the hope is to ultimately bring it to clinics where doctors can use it to assist them when they're prescribing antipsychotics. This will hopefully make treatment more effective, but also decrease the risk of any adverse effects. So far, there are not many machine learning algorithms to predict antipsychotic response that are combining a diverse range of genetic, clinical, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, as I propose to do in this study. Therefore, this will be a significant contribution to this field of science.","Demographic Categories of Interest

In this workspace, based on our results generated from French participants, we aim to confirm associations between rare, loss-of-function or gain-of-function DNA variants and the risk of metabolic disorders (or the level of associated traits) using All of Us. The rare variants will be located either i/ in coding exons from candidate genes involved in metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or in associated traits, or ii/ in non-coding genomic loci. To assess the functional effect of DNA variants we will either use in silico and/or in vitro studies. This project should lead to the identification or confirmation of functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the following datasets: whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA arrays
For WES and WGS, the analysis will be focused on rare variants in specific loci  (specific genes or specific non coding regions).or interest. DNA arrayswill be used for the calculation of genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for metabolic disorders or traits.
Genetic association analyses will be done between genetic markers (rare variants and/or PRS) and metabolic traits, when adjusting for relevant covariates (including sex, age, ancestry for instance).
Of note, to refine the analyses, we will use a functional genetic approach focusing on rare variants found in All of Us. For these in vitro studies, we have notably developed genome editing (i.e. CRISPR/cas9) in several human cell lines, which enables the functional analyses of small genomic regions (like an entire enhancer) or even of a single point mutation.","Anticipated Findings
This project should lead to the identification of new functional genetic markers and pathways involved in the development of metabolic disorders and should help to stratify the population for precision medicine.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between neurodevelopment (including conditions like autism and ADHD), genetic markers of such conditions, and neurodegeneration (including dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s). We will examine the role of several intervenable targets between neurodevelopmental and neurodegeneration. These lifestyle factors are known to impact neurodegeneration in the general population, but their role in people with neurodevelopmental conditions is unknown.

We will compare rates of neurodegenerative disorders across people with genetic liability for autism, ADHD, and ID, identified via polygenic risk scores, which will be expressed as a z-score based on the mean/standard deviation. We will examine data across the life course for evidence that genetic risk for neurodevelopmental conditions is linked to neurodegeneration and we will estimate the genetic correlation between the two using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression. We will then examine modifiable factors that may play a role in reducing risk, creating indicators from survey questions about lifestyle. We will use DNA methylation data to construct epigenetic clocks to examine accelerated aging. We will similarly examine the impact of other modifiable factors including cardiometabolic health, cognitive reserve (measured via employment and educational attainment), and self-reported physical activity levels.","Anticipated Findings
Preliminary studies have suggested neurodegeneration may be more pronounced in people with neurodevelopmental conditions. The ultimate purpose of this research is to increase understanding of neurodegeneration risk in people with neurodevelopmental conditions, with an eye towards modifiable factors. We will also examine the genetic link between genes associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, which may illuminate causal pathways to neurodegeneration. Using high-resolution phenotyping available in All of Us uniquely allows the examination of early-onset degeneration. This is important, as early-onset degeneration may be a target for intervention. Other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and cardiovascular health, may also be important targets for intervention. These explorations hope to improve public health.

We wish to investigate what are there are genetic determinants or risk factors of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is a common infertility disorder affecting approximately 8-13% of women who are of reproductive-age. While common, PCOS is also a complex and multifactorial disease without a clear genetic cause. PCOS overlaps with other diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndromes. It is not clear if these associated diseases are caused by or are consequences of PCOS, or if PCOS and these other disease collectively have a common cause. In addition, women with PCOS have negative body image perceptions, low self-esteem, depression, and decreased quality of life. There is a need to increase knowledge surrounding the risk factors and determinants of PCOS to improve risk identification, disease diagnosis, and disease treatment and management options.","Project Purpose(s)

Large-scale genome wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The aggregation of all the variants that are known to contribute to the disease in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRS) improves the prediction of a range of complex diseases. Most PRS have been developed within European ancestry study samples, further exaggerating health disparities across ancestries. There is a critical need to responsively and pro-actively expand access to accurate PRS. Specifically, diabetes, and its associated complications are one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. In fact, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), gestational diabetes (GDM) and related complications are excellent disease models to study the utility of PRS for predicting heterogenous and complex health outcomes in a setting where dramatic racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist.","Project Purpose(s)

To address the disparities in PRS across ancestries, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to aggregate and analyze genetic data from more than with T1D, T2D, GDM and glycemia-related complications and quantitative traits to improve the PRS prediction of diabetes and progression across lifespan in diverse ancestries with these Aims: (1) Collection, harmonization and integration of large-scale, multi-ancestry cohorts with diabetes traits across the life-span and genomics for development, training and testing PRS for diverse ancestries; (2) Development of methods to improve PRS prediction in non-European populations by using Bayesian approaches that allow integration of linkage disequilibrium and summary statistics from several ancestries. (3) Development, testing, and comparing performance of PRS for each trait, development of risk prediction tools that integrate clinical and genetic risk factors, and assessment of scenarios where PRS improve the prediction.","Anticipated Findings
Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will demonstrate how genomic data can inform more efficient and targeted preventive strategies within healthcare systems and across ethnically diverse populations.

Disease Focused Research (Type 2 diabetes mellitus )
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Our lab has developed gene-constrained methods for comparative analysis of genetic data between patient and non-patient populations of diseases that are affected by multiple genes.  These new methods are complementary to the well-known Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and can identify disease-associated genetic variants that are often missed by GWAS.  We have used one such method successfully, employing the relatively small dataset that was then available, to identify dozens of previously unknown genes that are potentially associated with T2DM.  We plan to apply this method to the larger datasets now available in All of US to analyze people with T2DM to those without in a way that accounts for both ancestry and gender.","Anticipated Findings
Using our newly developed genetic analytical methods and the larger datasets available in All of US, we expect to identify more genes that are associated with T2DM.    The analyses in this workspace will take both ancestry and gender into consideration to sensitize the detection of relevant genes and to ensure that the risk genes we identify are more accurate, relevant, and specific to the development of T2DM.  Our findings will help the scientific community and the public to better understand the genetic contributions to T2DM, which could lead to the development of more precise and personalized management plans for T2DM based on individualized genetic risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

When one hears the phrase ""health disparities"" they instantly think of traditional differences such as race, age, and physical impairment in chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and arthritis. What many fail to realize is there are additional groups that make up a large proportion of individuals that lack access to and/or receive very little information regarding different diseases and outcomes. The conditions in these subpopulations are often reported more when it comes to drug and/or alcohol abuse or mental illnesses. But why? Why isn't the playing field leveled to where all people can have access to information that may be vital to their health if not access to insurance and the proper care?

This study will primarily investigate whether a multidimensional whole health index, integrating measures of physical, mental, social, environmental, and financial well-being, offers a more robust prediction of chronic disease risk – including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers – within the ""All of Us"" cohort compared to traditional risk models that often rely heavily on clinical factors. Additionally, the research will explore if and how disparities across demographic groups (age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) are reflected in variations in these whole health metrics and whether these variations potentially explain differences in chronic disease burden.   A successful outcome could enhance chronic disease prediction capabilities, empowering healthcare providers with more accurate tools for early intervention and personalized prevention strategies.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
My research methods will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation matrices to gain a comprehensive understanding of data distributions and relationships among variables.  Operationalizing whole health domains into quantifiable metrics will be crucial (for example, using survey scores validated for mental health assessment ). Factor analysis will be employed to reduce dimensionality within the dataset. Regression analysis will then determine the relationships between the whole health index and chronic disease outcomes while controlling for confounding factors. Finally, I'll leverage machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks, to enhance predictive capabilities, identify key features, and effectively model complex interactions","Anticipated Findings
The overarching hypothesis is that the multidimensional whole health index will significantly outperform traditional risk models for chronic disease prediction. Additionally, it's anticipated that certain whole health domains might emerge as particularly strong predictors for specific chronic diseases (e.g., the role of social isolation in cardiovascular health). Crucially, the study aims to unveil how variations in whole health metrics align with patterns of chronic disease distribution across demographic groups, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms driving health disparities. These findings have the potential to revolutionize how we approach chronic disease risk assessment, going beyond isolated risk factors to a more holistic and personalized framework. The identified key whole health metrics will pinpoint crucial areas for targeted interventions at both the individual and population health level.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our goal is to develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for diverse ancestry groups to ensure equitable implementation of genomic medicine and reduce the potential worsening of health disparities in the context of genomic medicine. Our focus is on atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and the related risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia.

All of Us will be a critical resource in this context, given that diversity is a priority in this program.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. CAD is a chronic condition characterized by lipids, glycocomponents, and calcium depositions that thicken the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, that leads to atherosclerotic plaque buildup. Different CAD risk factors have been established, including lifestyle and genetic markers. Poor periodontal health has been reported as associated with CAD but not as much is known about the association between CAD and dental caries and additional quantitative markers of poor oral health.

Are there specific genetic variants associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease among patients with diabetes?
What is the prevalence of cardiovascular genetic risk factors among the diabetic Hispanic population?
Studying genetic variations linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk in diabetes individuals, especially in the Hispanic community, is essential for progressing personalize care and improving health outcomes. Identifying distinct genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes is the first step in developing personalized prevention and treatment approaches, especially in minority groups like US Hispanics. Further, a better understanding genetic predisposition may improve our biological understanding of cardiovascular disease in diabetics and facilitate specific therapies to lessen the burden of cardiovascular problems in this at-risk population.","Project Purpose(s)

Generating Descriptive statistics of the population:
Statistical Analysis: The use of statistical software (eg. Python) to generate descriptive statistics for the diabetes cohort. It will include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
Candidate gene study to identify if candidate SNPs (rs6923761, rs57922, rs9299870) are associated with risk of CVD in diabetes patients. This will involve the association of these SNPs within cardiovascular disease among diabetic patients.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings: Specific genetic variations, interacting with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signaling system, provide a complex risk factor for cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We anticipate that genetic variations in the GLP-1 signaling system may impact the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists by affecting insulin production, glucose metabolism, and atherosclerosis as well as overall cardiovascular risk. The study's findings are anticipated to improve our comprehension of why specific diabetes patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and how their reaction to therapy can differ depending on genetic factors.

I will impute SV variants in these cohorts in diabetes regions. I will then perform discovery and fine mapping for diabetes associations using SNV and imputed SV genotypes.
Additionally, to explore potential evidence of somatic instability at diabetes associated SVs, we will investigate allelic heterogeneity of long reads overlapping these regions.

Research question: Are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) associated with a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes?
Rationale: GLP-1RAs, commonly prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity, have recently gained attention for their anti-inflammatory effects in several organs, including the retina. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive retinal disease and the most common cause of blindness in developed countries. There are no current treatments for the most common form of AMD, known as “dry” AMD, which accounts for 85-90% of cases. Both in “dry” and “wet” AMD forms, chronic inflammation is central for promoting the degenerative process. Thus, GLP-1RAs present a potential therapeutic option for AMD.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (age related macular degeneration)","Scientific Approaches
We plan to build a cohort of patients with diabetes aged 40 and older, with no prior AMD diagnosis. We will develop concept sets and extract data on the primary outcome, i.e. diagnosis of AMD identified using EHR data, and primary predictor, i.e.  treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) prior to primary outcome.  Analyses will be performed in R notebooks within the All of Us Workbench environment.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to see an association between treatment with GLP-1RAs and risk of AMD.

1.	Which variants in our genome influence our weight ?
2.	How do the genetic variants we find relate to genes – do they directly alter the gene and its encoded protein ?, or do they act by switching genes on or off at different times and in different cells and tissues ?
3.	How do the genetic variants we find influence weight ? do they alter how we grow in childhood ?, the speed at which we put on weight ?, in which parts of the body we put excess weight ? how we respond to weight loss interventions ?
4.	How do the genetic variants we find help us understand the consequences of excess weight ? Can we use them to find out why people may develop obesity related conditions such as metabolic diseases (e.g. Type 2 diabetes, heart disease) , cancers and musculoskeletal conditions?
5.	Do the genetic variants we find and their links to excess weight and its consequences differ between groups of people from different broad genetic ancestry groups ?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (obesity)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
1.	Carefully curate the genetic and health related information that is linked to the AllofUS participants to ensure we are analysing only high quality data.2
2.	Select all AllofUS participants, and stratify them by their broad genetic ancestry.
3.	Use the latest genetic approaches to link genetic variation to weight related measures and characteristics. These characteristics will include height, weight, measures of weight change, electronic medical records of aspects of health related to weight – for example, weight loss after therapy, excess fat in the liver from medical images.
4.	Use the genetic information we have generated in steps 1-3 to understand the consequences of excess weight on health. We will use approaches such as “Mendelian randomisation”, a method that can help inform clinical trials. We will test genetic variants for their effects on many weight-related conditions, including cancer, Musculo-skeletal disease and metabolic diseases.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate the following findings:
1.	New knowledge about the genetic variants that influence weight, including those involved in growth, excess weight and changes in weight.
2.	New knowledge about how genetic variants influence weight. For example, through the brain, fat, muscle, circulating factors, or other mechanisms.
3.	New knowledge about the role of excess weight and different types of excess weight in health and disease
4.	Improved understanding of differences in the effects of excess weight on health between people from different genetic backgrounds. This is important because we know that, for a given Body Mass Index, people of Asian and African genetic ancestry, for example, have a higher risk of obesity-related conditions compared to people of European genetic ancestry.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of several complications including peripheral neuropathy. In addition to hyperglycemia, multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of other metabolic syndrome risk factors, particularly obesity, increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy. Given the evidence liking obesity to peripheral neuropathy, interventions that target metabolic risk factors are likely needed to prevent or reverse neuropathy. However, the appropriate intensity and timing of these interventions to prevent peripheral neuropathy remain unknown. A better understanding of how metabolic risk factors, physical activity level, and other lifestyle factors are associated with, and predictive of neuropathy, would inform the future disease modifying therapies.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) face a disproportionate risk for chronic non-AIDS-related morbidities, including adverse pregnancy outcomes. Several studies have postulated cART toxicities as contributors to this health disparity. In this research project, we aim to investigate the effect of dolutegravir (DTG) on the risk of gestational diabetes.  Case reports have identified an association of DTG with hyperglycemia and new-onset type 2 diabetes in PLWH. This research project will improve our understanding of the metabolic effects of DTG during pregnancy. Specific questions we will ask are (1) Is there a difference in the incidence of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based vs non-DTG-based regimens?; (2) What are the effective predictors for barriers to prenatal care access related to oral glucose tolerance testing?","Project Purpose(s)

We will apply computational methods to (1) Retrieve the incidence rates of glucose intolerance and increased gestational weight gain for HIV+ pregnant women on DTG-based vs non-DTG-based regimens; (2) Assess the influence of the length of DTG-based treatment time on the level of glucose dysregulation; (3) Identify predictors for barriers to prenatal care access related to oral glucose tolerance testing within different clinical settings (e.g., rural, urban, safety-net hospital, etc.).","Anticipated Findings
For this research project, we expect to identify metabolic differences related to glucose regulation for HIV+ pregnant women on different cART regimens. We hypothesize that the DTG-associated risk for hyperglycemia and diabetes observed in PLWH will similarly impact HIV+ pregnant women.

Our goal is to assess risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to allow identification of at-risk individuals of all minoritized groups for prevention. We aim to assess metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity among minoritized groups and if patterns of severity are different between sub-groups, to derive separate severity scores by group. We will further assess roles of SDOH in worsening severity between groups and evaluate long-term risk prediction for future CVD—all with the goal of providing detailed guidance for researchers and healthcare providers for CVD preventative care.
To these ends, we aim to answer the following questions:
-	Are there differences in MetS manifestation among marginalized groups?
-	If there are differences, how do severity scores derived within a group compare to those previously derived?
-	What are the relationships between MetS severity and SDOH?
-	Are there differences in CVD or T2D outcomes longitudinally by group?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Using the Controlled level v7 data to access EHR data from each participant, we will use confirmatory factor analysis of MetS components among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender sub-groups and assess how these differ from prior estimates, deriving group-specific MetS z-scores. Sub-groups will be assessed for differences in correlations between SDOH data and MetS severity. Finally, we will assess CVD and T2D, including new diagnosis and mortality relative to MetS z-scores at multiple time points.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find that MetS manifests differently among racial/ethnic and sexual/gender subgroups, warranting derivation of separate MetS-Z scores to guide identification and treatment for MetS-related risk. We further hypothesize that a large portion of this risk is related to SDOH burden in minoritized groups. In all sub-groups, we expect that higher scores will predict new disease outcomes. Deriving MetS-Z scores for each sub-group would enable more specific clinical assessment of future disease risk by sub-group. Identification of relationships between MetS severity, SDOH, and CVD outcomes would highlight the medical harm of experienced discrimination and could help in risk stratification for groups not normally seen as having elevated CVD risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Type 2 diabetes is linked to a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular complications. To minimize the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events, it is important to closely regulate blood sugar levels through different glycemic control treatments.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of different glycemic control can vary among individuals, implying that genetic factors might influence its cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is occurring at an increasing frequency in adolescents and young adults, resulting in severe complications such as kidney, eye, and nerve disease in early adulthood. The proposed research will leverage the National Institutes of Health-supported All of Us Research Program, one of the most diverse health databases in history, to identify and define clustering's of social risk factors that are associated with higher risk of T2D, or its precursor “prediabetes,” in young adults. Although several individual social determinants of health (SDOH) are known to impact diabetes risk, the detailed SDOH that is prospectively collected by All of Us is an unparalleled tool that has not yet been leveraged to evaluate the combined and interactive effect of SDOH on diabetes risk in young adults. This work will serve as preliminary data to develop targeted interventions that address the SDOH that are most strongly associated with diabetes risk in young people.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Type 2 Diabetes)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The research team will use the NIH All of Us Research Program dataset to develop a retrospective cohort of individuals ages 18-34 years (young adults) without type 1 diabetes. Using this cohort, the team will pair physical measurement data and Fitbit data, electronic health record data, and survey-based measures of social determinants of health (SDOH) and lifestyle to characterize the association between interpersonal SDOH (e.g., social support, discrimination and disrespect), built environment and neighborhood safety, economic stability, and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in young adulthood. The team will perform Latent Class Analysis and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders to identify clusters of social risk factors that are associated with prediabetes or T2D prevalence or frequency of risk reducing behaviors.","Anticipated Findings
The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that a phenotype of interpersonal social determinants of health, including poor social bonds and greater experience of discrimination, will be present more often in young adults with prediabetes and T2D than in demographically similar peers without prediabetes or T2D. The team also hypothesizes that interpersonal relationships will be associated with engagement in risk-reducing behaviors. Knowledge of the most important social risk factors, which are potentially modifiable, could ultimately help to reduce risk of diabetes in young people by guiding intervention development. As social risk factors also contribute to outcomes for other health conditions beyond diabetes, this work could be leveraged to address other diseases impacting young adults, especially those most vulnerable.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Previous genetic studies have successfully identified >240 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many of the identified loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome, masking the underlying “effector gene”. Additionally, these studies were primarily performed in individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. As genetic findings are integrated into the clinic, this limited genetic understanding threatens to exacerbate existing health disparities among non-European communities disproportionately suffering from T2D and T2D-related health complications. Expanding our genetic understanding into non-European ancestries is essential as these studies will mitigate such health disparities and improve our ability to identify causal loci and mechanisms. In this study, I will leverage the diversity found within All of Us to perform a trans-ancestry genetic analysis of T2D, identifying likely causal variants and evaluating their potential for clinical utility.","Project Purpose(s)

Using well-established techniques in statistical genetics, I will (1) conduct a genome wide association study of common variants, as well as other forms of genetic variation (e.g., rare variants, copy number variations), to identify trans-ancestry and ancestry-specific disease-associated loci, (2) use statistical and functional fine-mapping techniques to identify the likely causal variants at disease-associated loci, validating my findings with experimental approaches, and (3) evaluate the clinical utility of my findings through polygenic scores (PGSs) and screening for potential targets of drug repurposing. For these analyses, I will use all participants with genetic data (whole genome and SNP-array). I will develop a phenotypic algorithm to classify participants into T2D cases and controls based on previously published work in electronic health records.","Anticipated Findings
Genetic studies of T2D have already provided valuable insight into disease pathophysiology. However, the vast majority of these studies have been performed in European and East Asian ancestries, threatening to exacerbate existing health disparities in populations carrying a disproportionate disease burden as genetics enters the clinic through preventative and therapeutic interventions. In the present study, I aim to address these shortcomings by leveraging the diversity found within All of Us to expand our genetic understanding of T2D. Based on the prior success of similar studies, I expect to identify many rare and common T2D-associated loci that are shared across ancestries as well as ancestry-specific. Combined with experimental and computational approaches, I will use these results to identify variants that are likely causal for T2D, propose the mechanism by which these variants contribute to T2D risk, and propose ways to translate my findings into clinical intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Understanding how cells control the pivotal point of allocating glucose towards lipid or energy production is key to developing effective treatments for these and other common metabolic diseases. PAS kinase (PASK) is a nutrient sensing protein kinase that regulates this critical metabolic node of lipid versus respiratory metabolism. PASK controls many of the hallmark pathways associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and even neurodegenerative disease yet little is known about PASK alleles associated with human disease. Herein we propose to conduct the first large-scale analysis to identify PASK alleles associated with human disease.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
Analyze common and rare variants in USF1, ATXN2, and PASK compared to triglycerides, weight, cardiovascular measures, exercise levels and COVID-19 results.
Perform a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with common and rare variants in USF1, ATXN2, and PASK. Common variants in each of these three genes will be regressed against phenotypes from electronic health record data.","Anticipated Findings
We target PASK as well as two of its substrates for our study.  Due to their regulation of the critical node of glucose partitioning to lipid versus respiratory metabolism, we propose to uncover the influence of PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on a variety of human phenotypes and classes of disease, from hyperlipidemia and diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders using the All of Us dataset.
In addition to the wide variety of phenotypic data that will aid in understanding the influence of variation in cellular respiration and triglyceride levels, the ancestral diversity represented by the individuals in the dataset will allow us to identify patterns and variants that differ or are similar across ancestry, defining effects common to humankind while opening further studies on multigene, secondary variants.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We are estimating cumulative incidence of common disaeases (heart disease, diabetes, asthma) across polygenic score strata after appropriately modelling for age and sex. This has been done in European populations and we are validating the method on diverse ancestries. We will use broad geographic categories for ancestry as used by the 1000 Genomes Project (East Asian, South Asian, African, Hispanic, European). This is important to consider all participants and not just those of European ancestry. This is a first step in providing patients with absolute rather than relative risks when polygenic scores are implemented in the clinic.","Project Purpose(s)

Question: How do income, education, and occupation variables interconnect in influencing the prevalence of diabetes and obesity among adults aged 18-65?
Importance: Investigating the multifaceted relationship between income, education, and occupation will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the social determinants impacting diabetes and obesity. This knowledge is essential for developing targeted interventions that consider the interconnected nature of these socioeconomic factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
In our cross-sectional study targeting adults aged 18-65, we will employ a combination of surveys, medical records analysis, and interviews to investigate the relationship between income levels, diabetes, and obesity. Utilizing random sampling, we aim for a representative sample. Key independent variables include income, education, and occupation, while dependent variables encompass BMI and the presence of diabetes. Data will be analyzed using statistical methods, including inferential statistics and subgroup analysis. Geospatial tools will aid in exploring regional variations, and ethical considerations will be prioritized. This mixed-methods approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing health outcomes. Rigorous procedures will be implemented to ensure data validity and reliability.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings of this study suggest a significant correlation between lower income levels and higher prevalence of diabetes, with a parallel association indicating elevated rates of obesity among individuals with limited access to health resources. Additionally, the roles of education and occupation are expected to be crucial, acting as intermediary factors influencing overall health outcomes. Disparities in healthcare access are likely to emerge, particularly affecting lower-income groups and potentially hindering timely preventive care and early interventions. Regional variations in diabetes and obesity rates, tied to income disparities, are anticipated, highlighting potential geographical hotspots that may require targeted public health interventions.
The findings have the potential to inform the development of targeted interventions and public health policies, catering to the specific challenges faced by different income groups..","Demographic Categories of Interest

The primary scientific inquiry we aim to investigate revolves around ascertaining whether the simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents yields additional cardiovascular benefits in comparison to the inhibition of either target in isolation, particularly in high-risk patients.
This research question holds significant importance as prevailing guidelines advocate for a more intensive management approach for type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. However, a substantial number of these patients struggle to attain the recommended treatment targets, even with maximal therapy. By examining the combined effects on blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation through the inhibition of two blood glucose lowering agents , as demonstrated in this study, we intend to establish a compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic potential of a combined inhibitor approach.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes and CVD)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
Dataset:
Utilize individual-level data from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD. Identify those at high risk who fail to achieve target blood glucose levels despite being on the maximum tolerated therapy for blood glucose reduction.
Methods:
Stratify participants based on genetic variants that are predictive of higher or lower levels. Subsequently, compare the rates of blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular events.
Analyses:
Utilize linear regression models to quantify the differences in blood glucose levels based on specific genotypes. Additionally, employ Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events associated with different genotypes.
Test for interactions between genetic variants and the treatment effects of inhibitors on both blood glucose levels and clinical events.","Anticipated Findings
If genetic proxies confirm greater blood glucose reduction and cardiovascular benefit from blood glucose lowering variants, it would provide proof-of-concept evidence supporting combined pharmacological as a novel strategy for incremental risk reduction in high-risk patients, not at blood glucose goal. This would genetically validate the approach and inform the design of an outcomes trial directly comparing dual inhibition to individual inhibition alone","Demographic Categories of Interest

All prevalent human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s or diabetes, are known to be driven by a complex combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Numerous genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of genetic variants to common diseases. By design, GWAS
only find associations with a disease but cannot reveal which genetic variants are causal within
associated regions of the genome.  Current “fine mapping” algorithms, which aim to
pinpoint the truly causal variants, fail if there are too many variants that are inherited together, which is
often the case. This project will develop a new fine mapping method that uses GWAS data to identify
combinations of genetic variants.","Project Purpose(s)

The new method is based on a mathematical approximation that makes it much faster than existing
algorithms. This speed advantage allows the method to exhaustively explore the large number of
possible combinations of variants and identify those that have a high probability of being causal. In this

information about the human genome, such as the position of genes or molecular characteristics that
control the expression of genes.","Anticipated Findings

Adults with diagnosed or self-reported T2D will be identified from the dataset. We used medication codes to identify the person’s GLD use. We will study three groups: (1) adults filling Metformin plus DPP4, (2) adults filling Metformin plus SGLT2i, and (3) adults filling Metformin plus GLP-1RA. CI was measured using ICD code or survey from EHR. The three groups were matched with a 1:1 multigroup propensity score algorithm based on age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities (e.g., obesity, and cardiovascular disease). Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to compare the associations between newer GLD use and CI, further adjusting for residual unbalanced covariates after matching.","Anticipated Findings
There are three categories of glucose-lowering drugs, which include GLP1-RA, DPP4, and SGLT2i. The study may show that one of these categories is associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment compared to the other two categories.

This is particularly an issue for individuals with ancestry from malaria endemic regions, whose genomes may contain high impact variants in genes such as G6PD and HBB (i.e. sickle cell trait) that have been under selective pressure from malaria in the past and may now be interfering with accurate clinical use of the HbA1c measure.

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also commonly referred to as 'Long COVID', involves a range of symptoms that continue for weeks to months after the initial recovery from a COVID-19 infection. The risk factors for developing PASC include severe initial COVID-19 symptoms, age, and pre-existing health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, immune system responses and genetic factors might influence susceptibility. The purpose of this research project is to test for any relationship between genetic predisposition for diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and and heart disease and risk for PASC. If any associations are identified, we will try to identify immune system characteristics that may link the genetic predisposition with risk for PASC. Hypotheses generated through this research will be validated in the NIH-funded RECOVER cohort established for the study of PASC.","Project Purpose(s)

We will identify polygenic scores (PGS) for a set of complex health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease that have been generated using modern methods and validated on diverse cohorts. These PGS will be computed on the All of Us population to generate distributions of genetic risk. Relevant disease diagnoses and other relevant covariates, such as social determinants of health (SDOH), will be identified and assembled alongside genetic predispositions. If possible, Individuals with PASC will be identified using surveys and electronic health care records or other available data. We will perform an association analysis between genetic predispositions for health conditions associated with risk for PASC and the identified PASC cohort, as well as other relevant immune phenotypes, in the All of Us population.","Anticipated Findings
We will identify statistically significant associations between genetic predisposition for certain health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease and a cohort of individuals reporting PASC, as well as any immune phenotypes or other biological phenotypes that could be explanatory in nature.

Advancements in medicine and health sciences are allowing us to live longer than ever. However, as we age to such great lengths, humans become increasingly susceptible to age-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. These diseases can significantly reduce quality of life and many prove to be fatal. Certain individuals, however, can live to ages over 110 without ever developing these diseases or developing them much later in life. This ""supercentenarian"" demographic is arguably the best gold standard we have in humans for healthy aging. While lifestyle choices likely play a roll, we want to investigate if there are genetic reasons that may explain the resiliency to age-related diseases and the increased longevity seen in supercentenarians.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Aging-Related Diseases)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will use whole genome sequencing data from individuals 110+ years old to determine if there are genomic patterns that are conserved in supercentenarians. The Li Lab here at UC Irvine uses a variety of computational methods to find different types of genomic patterns in an unbiased manner. With the results from these tools we can then ask further questions about these genomic patterns: Where are these patterns located? What genes are affected by them? What biological processes are affected and could they explain supercentenarian resiliency to age-related diseases?","Anticipated Findings
If we do find conserved genomic patterns, and we are able to identify genes and biological processes that might explain supercentenarian longevity, it could greatly advance our understanding of healthy human aging. Also, if we can find genetic reasons that explain why supercentenarians avoid aging-related diseases, we may even be able to identify therapeutic targets and treatments for these diseases.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Pernicious anemia (PA), the end-stage of autoimmune gastritis, impairs the ability to absorb vitamin B12 from a non-vegetarian diet. Many patients diagnosed with PA suffer from delays in diagnosis, inadequate testing, and lack of understanding of disease etiology. Often PA patients have other autoimmune diseases like autoimmune thyroid and type 1 diabetes. Understanding the link between PA and other autoimmune diseases can help with understanding the heritability of these diseases. A previous genetic study found 5 genetic variants for PA, but replication is needed with the addition of other populations to understand how genetic diversity contributes to PA etiology. With a larger sample size, and more diverse sample, we will be able to find more genetic causal variants that contribute to pernicious anemia and if there is variation of etiology in different ancestral populations. Comparing the genetics of multiple autoimmune diseases can help find genetic variants that are specific to PA.","Project Purpose(s)

The first part of the study will be on constructing a classification model to automatically predict if a person has diabetes. There exist many such models for this like random forrest models, gradient boosted trees, artificial neural networks and simple logistic regression. The notebook will examine ways to mitigate the effects of being underrepresented in the dataset using method like Random Over Sampling and Interpolated Over Sampling (like SMOTE).","Anticipated Findings
The study expects to find classification models to predict most correctly on well represented groups within the All of Us Dataset. If there is a significant disparity of model fairness between genders or ethnicities  then this would call for more validation studies of other papers which do not examine fairness on protected features.
Decision trees, convolutional neural networks, and encoder decoder networks can be used to find latent feature representations of the highly dimensional datasets. These methods are useful in finding important features used in the prediction process, and can be used to see the importance of sensitive variables like race and gender in classification. We can also stratify the dataset by race and gender and see if certain features are important for some groups but not for others.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Question 1: Is there evidence for gene by PA interaction on T2D risk?
Question 2: If gene by PA interaction on T2D risk  exists, what is the biology driving this interaction?

We will investigate factors that contribute to diabetes at the population level, such as the built environment, including neighborhood walkability, parks and recreation, access to food, obesity, meal preparation, access to transportation, race and ethnicity, age, zip code, and access to health care. Descriptive statistics will be calculated. Multivariable analysis, risk ratio, and regression models will be applied to assess the risk associations.
Aim 2: We will use the subset of data from All of Us participants with or without Type 2 Diabetes with available whole genome sequences to identify nutrient-sensing mTOR variants in both males and females across all ethnicities. First, we will identify population-level genetic variations in mTOR proteins.","Anticipated Findings
Aim 1: Findings from these studies will identify the food access, built environment, and access social, demographic, and environmental factors that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus provide rational and justifications for public health policy changes for harm reduction from the build environment exposure on the development of type 2 diabetes.
Aim 2: We expect to verify whether there are mTOR-specific variants that could be used as predictive of type 2 diabetes or hold the promise of mapping out a favorable response to treatment. The findings might help identify mTOR variants that are either protective or elevated risk for the development of diabetes.
Collectively, data from this work will provide an understanding of the contributors of the exposome that lead to the development of type 2 diabetes and increased cardiometabolic risk, which could be utilized clinically to map out personalized precision-medicine plans.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) alone disproportionately affect minority populations. While rates of T2D among all races living with HIV have been reported, no data on the prevalence of the comorbid conditions - T2D and HIV- among minority people with HIV (PWH) are available. Similarly, while it is known that people living with comorbid diseases struggle to maintain positive health outcomes, the impact of comorbid HIV and T2D on glycemic outcomes among minorities is unknown. Achieving positive glycemic outcomes necessitates adherence to recommended treatment guideline. While data suggest that minority populations have lower adherence to treatment guidelines than white, the rate of adherence to prescribing recommended diabetes medications among PWH who have T2D and HIV are not known.","Project Purpose(s)

It has been estimated that 10.2% of the global population will have diabetes by 2030.  PRS combined with non-genetic predictors potentially holds utility for identifying individuals at high risk prior to disease onset, motivating positive health behavior change or repeated screening for those at high risk, or even guiding therapeutic interventions. The All of Us Research Program is uniquely situated to address these questions and identify opportunities for tailoring prediction across multi-ancestry populations.
Our primary study question is to investigate whether a multi-ancestry T2D PRS will be associated with T2D-related phenotypic risk factors and complications across diverse populations. In particular, we hypothesize that the T2D PRS may help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. Our secondary study question will investigate whether the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D risk is mediated by T2D risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)

We will construct a multi-ancestry T2D PRS based on a large multi-ancestry T2D GWAS meta-analysis. We will also construct a PRS based on a recent T2D GWAS meta-analysis that includes a larger number of non-European ancestry individuals. In addition, we will evaluate a genome-wide PRS using recent approaches such as LDPred2, PRS-CSx, and others.
For our primary study question, in analyses stratified by T2D status, we will evaluate the association between the T2D PRS and the T2D-related risk factors and complications using regression models. For our secondary study question, we will evaluate whether the T2D risk factors mediate the effect of the T2D PRS on T2D status. This will be performed using regression models to assess the relationship between 1) the PRS and T2D risk, 2) the PRS and the T2D risk factor, 3) the T2D risk factor and T2D risk, and 4) the PRS and T2D risk while adjusting for the T2D risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that our T2D PRS may hold prognostic value and help identify individuals at greater risk of developing T2D-related complications. We anticipate that the effectiveness of T2D PRS is context-dependent.

How do longitudinal activity measures, as captured by wearable technology like Fitbit, influence the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in individuals with diabetes?
Physical activity is a known modifiable risk factor in the management of diabetes. However, its specific impact on the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy is less clear. Given the global prevalence of diabetes and its complications, understanding how lifestyle factors like physical activity influence the risk of diabetic retinopathy is crucial for developing targeted prevention strategies.
This study could advance our understanding of how to effectively utilize such technology in chronic disease management and prevention. If a significant association is found, it could lead to more personalized health recommendations for individuals with diabetes, potentially integrating wearable technology into routine care to monitor and encourage physical activity.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
All of Us Research Program: Utilize the program’s comprehensive dataset, focusing on individuals with diabetes. The dataset will provide:
Physical Activity Data: Extracted from Fitbit devices, including daily step counts, exercise intensity, and duration.
Diabetic Retinopathy Data: Sourced from electronic health records, detailing the onset, progression, and severity of diabetic retinopathy.
Covariates: Demographic information, diabetes-related metrics (e.g., duration of diabetes, glycemic control), and other health factors.
Retrospective Cohort Study Design: Analyze existing longitudinal data to assess the relationship between physical activity and the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.
Descriptive Statistics: To summarize participant characteristics and activity patterns.
Regression Analysis: Employ logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between activity levels and diabetic retinopathy risk, adjusting for potential confounders","Anticipated Findings
Physical Activity's Impact: Expect to identify specific activity patterns that correlate with reduced diabetic retinopathy risk in diabetics.
Risk Quantification: Aim to quantify how much physical activity mitigates this risk, potentially finding beneficial activity thresholds.
Subgroup Variations: The study may reveal differences in activity-retinopathy associations across demographics and diabetes types.
Prevention Insights: Findings could enhance understanding of lifestyle factors in diabetic retinopathy prevention
Public Health: Results could inform public health recommendations, emphasizing physical activity in diabetes care.
Wearable Tech: Using Fitbit data demonstrates wearable technology's potential in chronic disease management.
Clinical Practice Guidance: Findings might help healthcare providers advise diabetic patients on physical activity for eye health.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects over 2 billion individuals worldwide and is associated with a number of health and social complications. There are currently three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of AUD, however the effectiveness of these medications are modest at best.
Emerging evidence suggests that the glucagon like peptide 1 agonists (GLP-1As) may be effective in reducing alcohol use. GLP-1As are currently approved for treatment of diabetes mellitus and obesity.  We aim to review the data of patients with diabetes mellitus and/or obesity who are taking GLP-1A versus those not taking GLP-1A, to compare their alcohol use. We will check the odds ratio/prevalence of alcohol use disorder among patients with or without GLP-1A. Other comparisons will include liver enzyme levels, prevalence of hepatic steatosis, and other comorbid conditions among those taking GLP-1A versus those not taking GLP-1A.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (alcohol abuse)","Scientific Approaches
a cross-sectional study to compare patients with diabetes mellitus and/or obesity who are on GLP-1A vs not receiving medication, assessing differences in alcohol consumption and the prevalence of alcohol-related liver disease.
Inclusion criteria: Adult patients aged 18 to 70 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or obesity (defined as a body mass index [BMI] greater than 30 kg/m2 in non-Asians, and BMI greater than 25kg/m2 in Asians.
Analysis steps : Participants will be sub-stratified into GLP1(+) versus GLP1(-).
The presence of alcohol use disorder will be collected from medical records. The degree of alcohol consumption will be assessed.
Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, BMI, comorbidity, laboratory data including liver enzymes, kidney tests, will be collected from medical records.  Alcohol use disorder will be classified according to the CDC classification system, Differences between groups will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that patients receiving GLP-1A treatment will exhibit a lower prevalence of alcohol use disorder and alcohol related liver disease compared to those not receiving GLP-1A.
If the data support our hypothesis, this finding would further support emerging evidence suggesting the GLP-1As have a role in reducing alcohol intake and potentially decreasing alcohol use disorder.
It is important to note that these anticipated findings are based on emerging evidence, and the actual results may differ. The study's outcomes will provide valuable scientific insights into the relationship between GLP-1A treatment, alcohol use disorder, alcohol-associated liver disease, and can potentially guide future research and clinical practice in this field.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hidradentis suppurativa (HS) is a highly heritable dermatological disease characterized by recurrent, painful nodules and abscesses. It is known to disproportionately affect patients of color. To date, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been published on HS. Our group, the HS Program for Research and Care Excellence (HS ProCARE), has already performed GWAS on HS patients who are in HS ProCARE. We aim to meta-analyze our results HS results from biobanks that have identified HS cases. We expect the results will increase understanding of genetic contributors to HS and improve understanding of the underlying causes of HS and the basis for known comorbidities such as inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.","Project Purpose(s)

I intend to study the validity of population stratification by race using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis, and its potential to identify more genetically valid variables to stratify populations on. I will be exploring the genetic diversity of populations with T2DM and examining how individuals of similar ethnic backgrounds cluster in principal component space.
This research is important because population stratification is a common practice in genetic research and can be used to identify genetic risk factors for diseases. However, there is a growing concern about the potential for this practice to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to health disparities. By examining the genetic diversity of populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, I hope to identify more genetically valid variables to stratify populations on and provide insight into how we can use genetics to inform public health interventions in a responsible and equitable way.","Project Purpose(s)

Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)","Scientific Approaches
I plan to use principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze genetic data from the All of Us dataset, specifically focusing on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. I will initially perform PCA on individual SNPs of interest and potentially on whole genome sequences to obtain larger degrees of scatter. Once I have visualized the variability in principal component space, I will perform clustering analysis on the points to identify commonalities between individuals within clusters. I will also compare the results of population stratification by race to stratification by other potential variables. I will use statistical software such as R or Python to perform these analyses. The research methods will adhere to ethical guidelines and ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants. The tools used will include PCA, clustering analysis, in Google Colaboratory for Python.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study are that the use of principal component analysis to stratify populations by race may not be statistically valid for certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. This could potentially lead to a more accurate and effective method of population stratification, potentially based on other genetic variables that are more relevant to the disease in question.
If successful, these findings could contribute to the body of scientific knowledge in the field of population genetics, as well as personalized medicine. The ability to more accurately stratify populations by genetic factors that are relevant to specific diseases could lead to more effective preventative and treatment strategies, ultimately improving public health outcomes. Ultimately we hope to recommend a novel population stratification method to allow for higher predictability of disease outcomes in population strata.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Do providers prescribe statins for hyperlipidemia and/or type 2 DM less often in patients with NASH than those without NASH?
PCP's are reluctant to prescribe statins to patient's with abnormal liver function tests because of the known risk of hepatotoxicity associated with statin use. However, statins have not only been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperlipidemia and type 2 Diabetes, but have also been proven to have anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-fibrotic properties and may thus inhibit progression from simple steatosis to fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) have become increasingly popular for diabetes mellitus associated with obesity as they are effective for weight loss and have gained FDA approval for weight loss in non-diabetic patients with obesity. Despite the increasing use of GLP-1 RA, their impact on diabetic retinopathy remains unclear. There is conflicting evidence on the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Most of this evidence stems from the multi-center long-term cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs, which have defined DR differently. Most of the other studies have not been large enough to adequately answer this question. This study aims to investigate the association between GLP-1 RA therapy and DR and diabetic macular edema progression via the All of Us research database. We will also determine whether lower socioeconomic status is associated with worse access to GLP-1 RA and thus worse DR.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
To determine if there is an association between use of GLP-1 RAs and progression/presence of diabetic retinopathy (none/NPDR/PDR) or diabetic macular edema that required treatment in the form of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) or corticosteroid (i.e., triamcinolone) injection, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Two cohorts: One on GLP-1 RA therapy and the other not on GLP-1 RA therapy. Only patients with type 2 DM. Patients should not have PDR prior to initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy. Patients should be treatment-naive (no prior intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy).
Covariates: Age at diagnosis of DM, sex, birth country, race/ethnicity, education level, insurance status, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, smoking history, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI).
Multivariate logistic regression.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that GLP-1 RA therapy is not associated with progression or presence of diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema that requires treatment in the form of intravitreal injections, panretinal photocoagulation, or pars plana vitrectomy. As the literature currently has conflicting evidence on this question, we hope this study will provide further guidance on this matter. Additionally, we hope that this study will encourage primary care physicians and endocrinologists to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus aggressively to minimize all the associated systemic complications of diabetes mellitus including worsening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema from worsening control of blood glycemic levels.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Public health relevance: There is clear and substantial evidence that sufficient physical activity and/or exercise is associated with better clinical outcomes. To that end, the CDC recommends getting 150 minutes of physical activity per week. However, conclusive evidence about the effect of timing and intensity of these 150 minutes of exercise on health outcomes is still needed. While multiple small studies have examined the question of timing and intensity, the All of Us cohort provides a large dataset to answer these questions with sufficient reliability.
Specific questions:
(1) The relationship of morning, afternoon, and/or evening physical activity and outcomes such as incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease or values of clinical measures such as HbA1c, fasting blood glucose,  cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
(2) The relationship of intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous as determined by Fitbit data) of physical activity/exercise with the above outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Findings - We envision our study will generate novel and fine-grained insights to understand the effects of timing and intensity of physical activity on various clinical outcomes. Through the use of machine learning, we expect to identify 'physical activity phenotypes', or groups of people who have shared physical activity-clinical outcome relationships. Identifying someone's physical activity phenotype can have two major benefits: (1) A more personalized physical activity regimen can be prescribed for a given individual, rather than a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, and (2) A better understanding of how physical activity timing and intensity affects physiological parameters and risk of disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project will explore machine learning models to predict cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are at substantially increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease.  A reliable predictive model could be very helpful for identifying individuals at the greatest risk so that they can modify lifestyle and health habits and their physicians can consider pharmacologic interventions and closer monitoring.
We are particularly interested in determining whether the model is as effective for historically underrepresented groups as it is for historically well represented groups.  Historically, medical studies examining prognostic predictors, including for cardiac health have focused on predominantly Caucasian populations and might not be as applicable to underrepresented minorities. Our goal would be to create a model that can effectively predict risk of cardiovascular disease for people of all demographic backgrounds.","Project Purpose(s)

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function (dementia). Studies suggest that patients with elevated blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease type dementias.  High blood sugar levels or Type2 Diabetes Mellitus may also be associated with an increased risk of dementia.  Some minority populations may have an increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes. For example, African Americans have a higher incidence of  hypertension. Therefore we will to investigate the grouping of racial and ethnic categories, with respect to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and  dementia, to determine whether minority groups have a stronger association between dementia and co-morbidities by race/ ethnicity.
The goal of this demonstration project is to validate previous research showing potential interactions between dementia, diabetes, and hypertension, with an explicit consideration of race/ ethnicity.","Project Purpose(s)

Data from participants (aged 40 or over) will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify interactions between the incidence of dementia, Diabetes, and Hypertension, and self-identified Race/ Ethnicity.   We will only analyze participants in this age group, because the incidence of dementia is very low in patients younger than 40.  We will only analyze patients with electronic health care data, because we have to ensure that patients have not had a diagnosis of hypertension, dementia or diabetes.
The statistical analysis package R will be used to create contingency tables, perform chi-squared and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Figures will be created in R.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that our data will confirm an increased rate of dementia in African Americans with hypertension and diabetes, compared to white participants. We will determine whether other minorities also see a difference in incidence of dementia, hypertension diabetes and interactions between the them.
If there is an increased incidence of  dementia in people with hypertension or diabetes, this may suggest that populations with these disorders need more careful monitoring of their conditions, as they may increase the chance of developing dementia.  potentially future All of Us projects may be able to determine whether long term control of hypertension (or Diabetes/ blood glucose)  may reduce the potential for developing dementia.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I will be investigating the utility of genetic risk score derivation to classify diabetes type among subjects in the ""The Immune Response in human Type 1 Diabetes Etiology"" cross-sectional study being performed at the Stanford Diabetes Research Center. The genetic risk score estimates we are using were developed primarily based on a population of subjects of European ancestry and it is uncertain whether these risk estimates translate to people of non-European ancestry, which is one of the questions we will attempt to answer.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (diabetes mellitus)
Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
I will stratify diabetes type genetic risk score (GRS) by ancestry to determine if the distribution of GRS has significant variation by ancestry group. For populations where GRS is significantly different from those with European ancestry, I will estimate population specific risk scales and test if these risk estimates are similar in our pediatric study cohort when stratified by ancestry. For statistical methods, I will derive genetic ancestry using pre-trained machine learning based classification models based on principal components analysis and will analyze the correlation (R2) between genetic and self-reported ancestry. I will use parametric t-testing to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean between each ancestry group with European ancestry individuals. Bonferroni correction will be applied to adjust alpha threshold for multiple testing. Percentiles of GRS derived from All of Us will be translated to absolute risk calculations as a product of prevalence.","Anticipated Findings
Our findings would be particularly notable if the genetic risk score estimates are not valid in subjects of non-European ancestry as it would imply that polygenic risk scores do not simply translate across different genetic ancestry thus requiring modification or otherwise development of new risk estimates specific to subjects non-European ancestry. Alternatively, it would also be significant to find that the genetic risk estimates are able to be validated in populations of non-European ancestry as it would potentially remove a barrier to bring polygenic risk scores to the patient bedside to aid in diagnosis or identify high risk individuals.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes represent a substantial public health burden. Identifying genetic predictors and determinants of complex disease risk may allow for the early identification of, and intervention for, individuals at risk of disease and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Furthermore, by interrogating the genetic architecture of intermediate phenotypes (e.g. body composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, and molecular phenotypes) we may identify novel predictors and risk factors for disease.

There is plenty of evidence within the MENA community about these disparities, yet the lack of a ""MENA"" demographic category has prevented these disparities from being validated through large, nationally representative databases. The ""All of Us"" database provides a unique opportunity for the MENA-identifying community to validate the challenges and struggles they have experienced for decades. This visibility and proper representation will be impactful in advocating healthcare systems and large public health databases to include a MENA demographic category, and will help the MENA-identifying community to advocate for and receive federal and local funding as well as appropriate public health interventions.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes is challenging to manage and requires lifelong self-regulation behaviors to prevent debilitating complications. Perceived discrimination could directly heighten stress response and impact individuals’ mental and physical health outcomes. However, previous studies show inconsistency in the influences of anxiety on diabetes outcomes. Social support has been linked to patients’ mortality rate and reported as deemed positive or buffering when it was related to a reduced impact of perceived discrimination on negative health. Thus, our research questions are: 1 Does perceived discrimination impact diabetes subjective and clinical outcomes? 2 What is the role of anxiety between perceived discrimination and diabetes outcomes? 3 Does social support moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and diabetes outcomes?4 Does social support moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and anxiety and further influence the effects of anxiety on diabetes outcomes?","Project Purpose(s)

For RQ1.1, hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis will be conducted to examine the impact of discrimination in medical settings on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.2, a correlation coefficient analysis will be used to examine relationships among study variables. A moderation analysis will be conducted to examine the role of Anxiety in the relationship between discrimination and diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.3. A moderation analysis will be conducted to examine if social support moderates the effect of discrimination on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
For RQ1.4.  Moderation analyses will be conducted to examine if social support moderates the effect of discrimination on anxiety and the effect of anxiety on diabetes care subjective and clinical outcomes.
All the analyses will control for demographics and physical health factors.","Anticipated Findings
This study aims to examine the direct effects of perceived discrimination in medical settings on the diabetes care outcomes, and the indirect effects of perceived discrimination in medical settings on the diabetes care outcomes through anxiety after controlling for demographics and individuals’ physical conditions. Social support has been previously reported as a significant factor associated with self-management outcomes among people with chronic health conditions. We hypothesize that social support will moderate the relationship between perceived discrimination and diabetes care outcomes, and social support will also moderate the effect of discrimination on anxiety and further decreases the effects of anxiety on health outcomes. We expect the results from this study to provide meaningful information to healthcare professionals regarding the impact of discrimination in medical care settings on patients’ health, and if social support could moderate the effects of said discrimination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Lupus is an autoimmune disease when the body's immune system attacks its tissues and organs, causing widespread inflammation - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus became a global pandemic, and while there were many named co-morbidities- such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer, however, there was very little information about the association of COVID-19 and Lupus. Vaccines are well-studied medications to reduce and have even eliminated many diseases in the national population. As Lupus is an autoimmune disease, most medical professionals encourage their patients to get at least one of the available vaccines. Still, many African Americans, even those without Lupus, hesitated to get a vaccine. This study looks at the impact of Covid-19 infections on those diagnosed with Lupus and attitudes surrounding available vaccines.","Project Purpose(s)

Scientific Question: How do patterns of physical activity and dietary habits influence the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in urban areas? Why are some urban areas more affected than others, even with similar socio-economic backgrounds?
Importance: Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern, especially in urban areas. Understanding the relationship between lifestyle habits, such as physical activity and diet, and the prevalence of this disease is crucial. By identifying key factors in specific urban regions, we can design better public health interventions and policies. This will not only help in managing the disease but also in preventing its onset in at-risk populations. The significance of this research transcends the realm of science and directly impacts community health, potential healthcare costs, and overall quality of life.","Project Purpose(s)

Previous studies have been able to map variations in medication administration and treatment decisions in conditions like Type 2 Diabetes and substance abuse disorder. Similar to contraception, there are many options for the treatment of high blood sugar and substance use and may be a complex decision-making process between personal and provider preferences. No currently published work has mapped the contraception decisions of an individual over time. Our goal is to quantify the variation in contraception prescriptions for individuals in the All of Us Research Program dataset.
The overall objective of this project is to understand contraception prescription patterns in individuals who identify as female within the All of Us dataset.

A retrospective, longitudinal analysis will be conducted using the All of Us Research Program dataset to identify contraceptive prescribing patterns for individuals who identify as female in the United States. First, we will use the Cohort Builder within the workbench to identify all eligible adult participants (≥18 years of age) who identify as female. We will then limit the cohort to just individuals who have a medication record of at least one contraceptive including, birth control pills (e.g., Microgestin), IUDs (e.g., Levonorgestrel [Mirena]), implants (e.g., Etonogestrel [Nexplanon]), and injections (e.g., Depo-Provera).

Non-Hispanic Blacks are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and twice as likely as non-Hispanic Whites to die from diabetes. While socioeconomic status does play a role in the prevalence of diabetes, it's important to note that the relationship between income and diabetes prevalence is complex and influenced by many factors.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 1000 genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, and these results have started to be used for applications with potential clinical use, such as polygenic risk scores (PRS) intended to predict the development of the disease. However, Latino ancestry has been historically underrepresented, as most GWAS have been developed within European ancestries. Besides delaying the discovery of the genetic regions associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in Latino populations, it has also compromised the performance of  PRS and exaggerated health disparities across ancestries. Scientific aim: Improve and validate methods to improve PRS prediction in Latino populations by leveraging summary statistics for multiple ancestry groups.","Project Purpose(s)

In this study, we aim to explore the genetic variants and other environmental and lifestyle risk factors that are associated with diabetic neuropathy.
Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a nerve damage that occurs in diabetic patients. This is due to the inability of the body to produce insulin, which metabolizes glucose in the body, and excess glucose in the blood leads to nerve damage and other complications. Prior studies have shown the relationship between DN and higher hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, age, longer duration of type 1 diabetes, male sex, greater height, higher weight, low physical activity, higher pulse rate, family history of type 2 diabetes, lower HDL cholesterol, higher total cholesterol, medication use, obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, etc.

This includes data from about 340 sites across the United States and can be termed diverse due to the inclusion of more than 50% of racial and ethnic minorities, and about 80% of groups underrepresented in biomedical research.
An exploratory data analysis including histogram plots showing the proportion of people with DN aggregated by age, gender, and race/ethnicity will be carried out. It is equally important to understand how levels of physical activity change in relation to diabetic neuropathy, and this relationship will be visualized using bar plots. Furthermore, we will investigate the genomic data by DN status.
Using R statistical software, a logistic regression model will be used to explore these relationships.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to find a correlation between diabetic neuropathy and existing risk factors, such as higher hemoglobin levels, age, duration of diabetes, male sex, hypertension, BMI, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, and low physical activity.
Since there has been no existent cure for diabetic neuropathy, our findings will form a basis to further solidify the evidence of association between the existing risk factors and DN and may identify more lifestyle and environmental factors responsible for this condition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Wearable devices such as Fitbit and Apple Watch have been available for many years, tracking information such as steps, activity, heart rate, and sleep.  While as patients and consumers we find this information useful in managing our general fitness, the data captured by these devices may have associations with important medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  In some cases, wearable device data can be uploaded to our personal physicians through patient portals such as MyChart, however it remains unclear how this information can and should be utilized by medical providers.  In this study, we hope to explore the associations between wearable device metrics, including steps, heart rate, activity, and sleep, with medical outcomes such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity.  Associations between wearable device data and diagnoses of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease will also be explored.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Other Purpose (Class project for a graduate course in Biomedical Data Analysis)","Scientific Approaches
We will be utilizing the following datasets from the All of Us Research Program: demographics, physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference), EHR data (laboratory, diagnoses, vital signs), and of course wearable device data (heart rate, steps, sleep, and activity).  This will primarily be an exploratory data analysis to determine if the data is robust enough for more advanced predictive modeling.  We will utilize primarily descriptive statistics and regression through Python 3.11.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify useful associations between wearable device metrics, such as activity and sleep, and the onset of clinical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease.  Nevertheless, given the limitations of wearable devices, it's also possible that no relationships will be identified.  We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels of daily activity and sleep are less likely to develop these clinical conditions.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 10% of the world's population will have diabetes by 2035. Patients living with diabetes are at higher risk for many acute and chronic complications, which may lead to increased hospital or ED visits. Accurate subtyping of those with type 2 diabetes is crucial to understand what characteristics of patients lead to increased risk of adverse outcomes, and is key to more effective and targeted treatments of diabetes and its complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will make use of a machine learning method called Deep Metric Learning (DML). DML seeks to learn a representation of the patient's state by maximizing its similarity with other patients with the same label. DML has previously been shown to be effective in subtyping several diseases in the medical imaging domain. However, DML has not been widely used on Electronic Health Records (EHR) and genetic data. Here, we propose using DML to learn subtypes for type 2 diabetes using time-series data from the EHR, as well as survey and genetic data.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that the DML representations we learn will form natural clusters corresponding to patient subtypes. We anticipate that patients in particular subtypes will exhibit similarities based on their input features (i.e. demographics, labs, vitals, surveys, or genetics). Patients in different subtypes may also have different outcomes (i.e. # hospital visits, complications, mortality). We believe that characterizing such subtypes will be useful for clinicians to provide targeted treatments to different patients, which may improve health outcomes. Characterizing such subtypes may also be useful in more accurate diagnosis of diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The escalating burden of severe obesity in women of reproductive age has driven a growing utilization of weight loss surgery (WLS) in this population. Despite benefits such as reduced incidence of gestational diabetes, a pregnancy after WLS is considered high-risk given the elevated rate of various adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, there have been serious concerns about the negative impact of WLS on maternal mental health, particularly related to depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality. These mental disorders increase the risk for severe maternal morbidity by 50% and are the leading cause of maternal mortality.
We propose to use All of Us data to accomplish two specific aims. Aim 1 Determine the individual and composite prevalence of depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality in pregnant women post-WLS. Aim 2 Examine the association of composite mental disorders with severe maternal morbidity post-WLS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
For Aim 1, we will use t-test to compare the prevalence of mental disorders between pregnant women post-WLS and comparison groups. For Aim 2, we will apply logistic regression to examine the association between mental disorders and severe maternal morbidity, adjusting for factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and pregnancy complications.","Anticipated Findings
This study is of clinical significance because the findings will aid clinicians in offering more informed counseling regarding the risk-benefit profiles of preconception WLS. Also, this study carries policy relevance. Current policies aiming to enhance perinatal mental health care mainly target traditional high-risk groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status. This study will raise awareness about the mental health burden faced by women conceiving post-WLS, supporting future advocacy for the inclusion of their needs into policy formulation. Moreover, while national guidelines for post-WLS pregnancy management have been published, mental health was a missing piece. This study can, therefore, foster efforts to develop more inclusive guidelines that incorporate mental health aspects, to optimize maternal care post-WLS.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It is currently known that young adults of black and Hispanic descent tend to have poorer health outcomes than their white counterparts in managing a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, involving higher HbA1c levels over time, less use of diabetes technology, and poorer self-reported measures of management at home. Additionally, individuals of black and Hispanic descent are at an increased risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the onset of diagnosis, which is associated with lower glycemic control over time and poorer health outcomes. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that sufficient genetic screenings be implemented so that type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed asymptomatically. The question that arises is whether or not these screenings are readily accessible to individuals who are at an increased risk. Given that early diagnoses are associated with better health outcomes, this study aims to explore the association between race, age of diagnosis, and health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Juvenile Diabetes)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The first dataset will be individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes as confirmed by mention in the medical records. I will exclude individuals who presented with DKA, as DKA is associated with a lower age of diagnosis upon onset and may present a confound. I seek to explore confirmed diagnoses before the onset of life-threatening illnesses, such as DKA.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate that individuals of black and  Hispanic descent will be diagnosed with T1D at an older age due to various factors such as generalized mistrust within the healthcare system and less access to reliable healthcare. This will further indicate who is currently most at risk and will allow for public health efforts to create targeted initiatives to increase the accessibility of screenings in those communities.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Liver disease was the #10 cause of death in the United States in 2022. Risk factors for advanced liver disease include viral hepatitis infection, excess alcohol use, and components of the metabolic syndrome including diabetes. However,  we have only limited ability to predict who is at highest risk of developing advanced liver disease and, therefore, how to prevent advanced disease. We aim to identify predictive models for advanced liver disease incorporating genetics, demographics, behaviors, lived environment, medical comorbidities, laboratory values, and other predictors. We are also interested in looking at population attributable fraction for different risk factors (metabolic comorbidities, genetics, lived environment, and behaviors including alcohol intake and substance use) across different populations including race and geography.","Project Purpose(s)

The purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the response to antidepressants for patients with bipolar depression using data from AllOfUs.  The project aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the optimal use of antidepressants in this population and to identify any potential relationship between diabetes and depression.","Project Purpose(s)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
This is a retrospective, observational, matched case control study of depressed patients treated with antidepressants. Cases were patients who took a specific antidepressant and controls took other antidepressants. The study examined the performance of one antidepressant against others. The study does not determine if the patient should take antidepressants. Instead, for patients whose clinician has prescribed, or will prescribe, an antidepressant, the study clarifies which one has the highest evidence of remission. In this observational study, we will  statistically control for observed confounding and selection bias. The study will focus on confounding by indication.  Confounding by indication means that a comorbidity, procedure, or medication (all measured in the year prior to taking the antidepressant) is associated with selection of the antidepressant and/or the remission outcome.","Anticipated Findings
This study intends to improved accuracy of clinical decision aids by examining effectiveness of antidepressants after statistically removing observed confounding/selection bias in the data.  To remove bias, the study will identified features of patients’ medical history that either predicted remission or affected prescription of antidepressants.  This study summarizes experience of remission for cases that fell within each subgroup.  This study intends to optimize antidepressant recommendations based on which subgroup matches patients’ medical history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How does the prevalence and incidence of diabetes vary across different racial and ethnic groups, and what underlying factors contribute to these disparities? What role do genetic factors play in the development and progression of diabetes among various racial groups, and how do these interactions relate to other risk factors? How does access to healthcare services, including quality of care and diabetes education, influence racial disparities in diabetes management, complications, and mortality rates? How does the impact of diabetes on cardiovascular health and other complications differ among racial and age groups, and what potential mechanisms contribute to these disparities? Are there racial differences in the effectiveness and safety of various diabetes medications and treatment approaches, and if so, what underlying factors might be responsible?

•	Primary Outcome Measure: Percent of patients prescribed weight loss medications who meet criteria for prescription.
•	Secondary Outcomes: Disparities among demographic data and other data elements of interest
•	Data elements of interest include primary language spoken at home, education level, food and housing instability, perceived social support, perceived neighborhood safety, subjective experience of discrimination based on or presence of 2 or more obesity related comorbidities","Anticipated Findings
We conducted an earlier retrospective cohort study on TriNetX over 83 million patients, which showed lower GLP-1 RA prescriptions in the Latinx population, and higher rates of prescription in White, Black, Female and patients with larger amounts of obesity-related comorbidities. Other recent studies on cohorts with diabetes have found similarly lower prescription trends of GLP-1 RA's and SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-white persons (doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.13885).
We anticipate finding similar demographic differences in this study. Through its robust survey data on participant's social determinants of health, AllofUs provides a unique lens into the lives of our patients.

This project is looking to examine the impact of social determinants of health, as deemed by Healthy People 2030, on the management of diabetic retinopathy which includes the diagnosis, treatment, and visit adherence among patients with diabetes. Approximately one out of ten people in the United States have been diagnosed with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in these patients ranging from ages 20-74. Investigating diabetic retinopathy through a socioeconomic lens is crucial to identify populations that are receiving inadequate care for their condition. Once these populations are identified, work can be done to reduce the deficits and gaps in care provided.","Project Purpose(s)

This project will examine patients in the database that are diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, including proliferative and non-proliferative. Next, the population that has not visited an eye doctor within the past year will be selected for. One of the main goals of this project is to identify geographic disparity. Moreover, numerous variables among this group will be analyzed as well including, but not limited to, age, gender, self-identified race and ethnicity, level of education, level of income, insurance status, ocular and diabetic drugs prescribed. Subsequently, once the data is gathered, basic quantitative statistics will be run to identify significant correlates between the data and the variables identified.","Anticipated Findings
The aim of this study is to identify certain populations that are at risk of lack of adherence to their eye care. A large gap of knowledge that exists within the ophthalmology community can be addressed by conducting this investigation via a large-scale database which focuses on patients underrepresented in biomedical research such as the National Institute of Health’s All of Us.

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of bacterial contribution to the development of vascular disease and identify factors that lead to dysbiosis. We will examine oral and blood pathobiont composition and look for social determinants that affect the microbiome composition, such as smoking history, diabetes, urban/rural setting, etc. We will also look for microbial signatures that influence the type of vascular disease a patient develops (ie, is there a difference between patients with atherosclerotic disease and aneurysmal disease. Is there a difference between patients with different locations of occlusive disease). Our central hypothesis is that bacteria within the mouth and in the blood create small molecules that contribute to the development of vascular disease and different microbial signatures may influence the type of disease a patient develops.","Project Purpose(s)

There is a complex relationship between mental and metabolic health, especially in the context of antipsychotic medications and their side effects. Schizophrenia is a very rare psychiatric disorder, yet the medications prescribed for individuals with this disorder have some of the strongest and most adverse metabolic side effects, ranging from rapid weight gain to dysregulation of blood glucose. But what happens if individuals taking certain antipsychotics begin to experience increased A1C and weight gain, common indicators of an increased type 2 diabetes risk? Do these individuals receive standard medical care for diabetes management? How do social and economic factors influence diagnosis, symptom management, and choice of medication? The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between schizophrenia diagnosis, treatment, and metabolic side effect management through electronic health records to highlight the importance of side effect management to prevent comorbidities.","Project Purpose(s)

Nearly 2 million people suffer from the autoimmune disease known as Type I Diabetes in the US. Strong genetic components have been found between HLA Class II genes (antigen presenting on T cells) and Type I Diabetes. We are interested in exploring HLA allele frequencies associations for Type I Diabetes in the All of Us cohort, and determining which alleles have higher risk of developing the disease, and whether the known alleles are replicated across different ancestries.

We are interested in accessing the Type I Diabetes to contrast with two control populations: the general population and Type II Diabetes. To generate HLA alleles, we will use imputation methods such as SNP2HLA or DEEP*HLA. Our first attempt will be to replicate previous well-classified HLA associations to determine how well our imputation worked. We will then proceed to determine novel associations using a case-control analysis. We will adjust for population substructure and incorporate local ancestry. We will use the All of Us platform to access de-identified EHR and genomic data in a context that will protect the privacy of participants.","Anticipated Findings
HLA is the most diverse genomic region which makes it difficult to study in traditional association studies. Understanding the variation underpinning Type 1 Diabetes in different ancestry groups will increase our understanding of how the diversity affects the etiology of this autoimmune disorder.

Diabetes mellitus is a (potentially chronic) disease categorized by excessive concentrations of glucose in the bloodstream and, consequently, the urine—this is colloquially known as “diabetes” (which is what we will be referring to as well). Diabetes mellitus can further be broken into two categories: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Both types have underlying genetic influences, but the main difference is that type 1 is postulated as being caused by the body’s immune system attacking and wreaking havoc on the body's own pancreas, while type 2 has been shown to strongly correlate to physical hypoactivity and obesity. Type 1 used to be called “juvenile diabetes” due to being significantly more common in children and not having been linked to lifestyle factors (e.g., an individual’s own choices).","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
For the genomic data collected through All of Us, we will use a sample and variant call rate of >0.98, and filter variants to a MAF>0.01. We will use available imputation with R2>0.5. We will collect the baseline HbA1c and on-treatment HbA1c after index GLP-1 RA. The outcome variable will be baseline minus on-treatment HbA1c, adjusted for baseline . We will similarly calculate change in weight. Discontinuation of the index GLP-1 RA within 3 months will be a proxy for drug intolerance. We will perform GWAS for each endpoint. Multiple linear regression using an additive model will test the association between variants and quantitative traits, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and principal components. For medication discontinuation, logistic regression will be used. Analyses will be computed for each ancestry and meta-analyzed. We will assess for genome-wide significance and experiment-wide significance after Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify novel genetic predictors of response to GLP-1 RAs, as measured by glycemia, weight loss, and side effects. Our findings will generate scientific evidence supporting the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics and leading to a change in the standard of care for patients with type 2 diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, fatty liver disease and cancer are the epidemic illnesses of modern life. These diseases often occur together, and one common cause is resistance to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance; IR). When measured in the clinic, IR can strongly predict who will develop these diseases later in life. The causes of IR are both hereditary (genetic) and environmental. There is only one class of drugs, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), that treats IR, but TZDs have serious side effects that prevent their widespread use. If we knew which genes were responsible for changing IR, new and much needed therapies could be developed. Here, we propose to use genetic information from participants in All of Us to find people who are genetically protected from IR and look for the specific genetic variants that confer this protection. The result of this project will be new potential targets for therapeutic development to prevent and treat these epidemic scale chronic diseases.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Insulin Resistance)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We propose to use previously published GWAS for traits related to insulin sensitivity/resistance to construct an insulin resistance genetic risk score composed of a series of SNPs. The score for every participant from All of Us will be computed. The participant score will be regressed against the clinical data of the participants including diabetes, cardiovascular events and incident cancers as well as physiologic measures of body composition and relevant serum chemistries and lipid levels. A quantitative clinical profile will be constructed based on this score that is a composite of diagnoses, physiologic and serum measurements. The whole genome sequencing of subgroups of individuals with extreme clinical profile values will be examined for loss-of-function mutations in protein coding genes.","Anticipated Findings
If successful, this research will identify novel mutations and novel genes that protect individuals from diabetes, cardiometabolic diseases, fatty liver disease, and some cancers. Such genes could lead to new classes of medications for these therapies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The overall goal of this study, as a Demonstration project, is to evaluate the ability of the All of Us Research Program data to replicate epidemiologic patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, previously described in other setting. We will address this goal with these two aims:
• Specific Aim 1. To determine the association of race and ethnicity with the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesize than non-whites will have lower prevalence and incidence of AF than whites.
• Specific Aim 2. To estimate associations of established risk factors for AF with the prevalence and incidence of AF. We hypothesize that increased body mass index, higher blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and a prior history of cardiovascular diseases will be associated with increased prevalence and incidence of AF.","Project Purpose(s)

We will select all All of Us participants who self-reported sex at birth male or female, whose self-reported race was white, black or Asian, as well as those who self-reported being Hispanics.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) will be identified from self-reports in the medical survey or from electronic health records (EHR).
Clinical factors will be identified from EHR and study measurements (blood pressure, weight, height).
We will evaluate the association of demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and clinical (body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, cardiovascular diseases) factors with prevalence of self-reported AF and prevalence of AF in the EHR, as well as incident AF ascertained from the EHR.","Anticipated Findings
The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), overall and by race/ethnicity, as well as to confirm the association of established risk factors for AF in the All of Us Research participants.

One key measure of diabetes diagnosis is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which reflects blood glucose levels over a period of the past two to three months. However, this lab value has been shown to have a statistically higher mean in minority populations. Specifically, genetic markers implicated in individuals of African ancestry artificially change measured HbA1c levels and potentially make it difficult to diagnose diabetes within this population. We are interested in exploring the effects of this diagnostic and prognostic obstacle on the progression and outcomes of diabetes and subsequent complications in individuals of African ancestry compared to those of other ancestries, including European.","Project Purpose(s)

We anticipate that the variability in HbA1c across ancestries and genetic variants will impact the risk of developing diabetic complications in vulnerable populations. While HbA1c is a widely relied upon diagnostic and prognostic factor for diabetes, such findings would highlight the need to employ other additional measures of glucose control in order to accurately monitor disease in certain populations. Furthermore, we may uncover a need to routinely screen individuals of African ancestry for certain genetic variants that affect HbA1c levels to prevent drastic changes down the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The long-term goal of this Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) pilot project is to identify genetic loci associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although diabetes and hypertension are primary risk factors for CKD, genetic factors have also been associated with CKD-defining traits. In this study, we will examine genome sequence variation among individuals in diagnosed with CKD with those not diagnosed with CKD. Our project seeks to: 1) identify putative genetic loci that increase risk for CKD that have not been previously reported; 2) examine associations between known CKD risk loci among individuals in study; and 3) compare genetic data with other CKD studies as a way of assessing whether individuals included in the study are a representative cohort of CKD subjects.

To conduct this study, we will combine de-identified data we plan to generate for 100 CKD patients from Maine with All of Us data. We plan to use All of Us data for both cases and controls. The overall statistical analysis approach consists of three components as follows. First, we will analyze distributions of relevant clinical data from participants, such as eGFR and age separated by sex. Second, we will analyze population stratification using ADMIXTURE (Shringapure et al, 2016) and PLINK (Purcell et al, 2007) to identify any subpopulations that differ genetically and if disease prevalence differs among those subpopulations (Marchini et al, 2004). Distributions of alleles among participants will be compared to reference panels in order to estimate individual ancestry proportions. For the GWAS analysis, genetic associations will be tested using PLINK.","Anticipated Findings

Our aim is to analyze the relationship between gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia in women of different racial backgrounds. Past literature suggests a relationship between gestational diabetes and race, with women of color being disproportionately affected compared to their white counterparts. In addition, it has been suggested that gestational diabetes is a major risk factor for pre-eclampsia. If both of these hold true, we expect to see increased risks for pre-eclampsia with markers associated with gestational diabetes.
Because A1C, triglycerides, MAP, HDL, and BMI are well-studied predictive markers of gestational diabetes, we expect to see a positive relationship between these risk factors and the occurrence of pre-eclampsia in different ethnic groups.","Project Purpose(s)

In addition, as research suggests there may be a genetic component to the development of complications in individuals with T2D, we aim to utilize some of the genomic data from the controlled tier to further enhance our dataset. This may be through examining individual polymorphisms associated with T2D and its complications as well as GWAS or PRS data combining multiple genotypic variations.

Family history of disease provides a gateway to studying the complex interplay of genetic influences, shared environment, lifestyle, as well as common behavioral factors known to increase risk for many common chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Elucidating how family history contributes to an increase in disease risk and discerning the factors that contribute to the relationship between family history and disease development-- such as whether it is derived from genetic or shared environment-- can help identify individuals at higher disease susceptibility, enable targeted screening initiatives tailored to individuals who may benefit from a more thorough clinical assessment, and establish the effectiveness of family history data in the practice of preventative medicine.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
While most family history-based screening tools assess familial risk based on a crude definition of the presence of a positive family history among any family member, a detailed pedigree of family history can capture greater detail on disease risk. In this study, we plan on studying family history of disease data as captured by first-degree (whether a parent or sibling had a disease) and second-degree (such as a grandparent, half siblings, aunt or uncle). We plan to use the family-history wide association study approach to systematically and comprehensively identify associations between laboratory traits and measurements and lifestyle information and family history of disease, including cancer, heart and blood, digestive, hormone and endocrine, kidney, lung, brain and nervous system, mental health and substance use, and bone, joint and muscle, hearing and eye conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Family history information captures inherited genetic and shared environmental contribution to disease risk. Further, the impact of family health history has not been adequately studied in historically underrepresented populations. The AllofUs Research dataset is uniquely enriched with underrepresented populations. By delineating the mechanisms by which family history affects inherited traits and environmental measurements and results in increased disease risk among diverse populations, our study aims to leverage the rich population-based family history data in All of Us to uncover novel associations that can enhance our understanding of the influence of family history.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Such populations include those who were born in, or resided in, countries with high TB prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (homeless shelters or correctional facilities).
Others who should be screened are immunosuppressed (persons living with HIV, on immunosuppressive medications like chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or after an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis.

I am exploring the data to understand diabetes in patients with HIV/AIDS. The scientific question to be answered is whether HIV-infected adults are at higher risk to develop diabetes compared to non-HIV adults. The secondary question is effectiveness of diabetes oral medications among HIV-infected and non-HIV adults if data available. The data regarding diabetes in HIV-infected adults is controversial. With the advancement of HIV treatment, HIV has become a chronic disease. Diabetes management in this population is increasingly important determinants of the complications. It is important to understand the diabetes treatment response among HIV vs non-HIV population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (type 2 diabetes mellitus)","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we used All of Us baseline data from patient (age>18) provided information (PPI) surveys and electronic health record (EHR) blood glucose measurements and retrospectively examined the prevalence of diabetes in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED codes and blood glucose medications recorded in the EHR.  We used the EHR data (SNOMED codes on 2 distinct dates and at least one diabetes medication) as the primary definition, and then add subjects with elevated  blood glucose.   We extracted each participant’s detailed dates of SNOMED code for diabetes from the Researcher Workbench table ‘cb_search_all_events’. We calculated an age-standardized diabetes prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, ≥ 60).","Anticipated Findings

Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, including some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Individuals with a specific variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2*2) are at higher risk of many of these diseases. Given that ALDH2*2 is the most common single genetic variation in humans and that more than half of all American adults drink alcohol, an opportunity is present for targeted chronic disease risk reduction in a large number of Americans. However, in order to design effective public health strategies, such as targeted intervention programs, a better understanding of current alcohol consumption behaviors and associated factors, overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype, is needed. This study aims to characterize the alcohol consumption behaviors among participants in the All of Us Research Program and examine factors that may be related to the behaviors, overall and by ALDH2 genotype.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will analyze data from the All of Us Research Program database regarding alcohol consumption behaviors, ALDH2 genotype (rs671), demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health. All participants with informative data for rs671 will be included in the study. These data sets will be from surveys, physical measurements, and the genomic data set. Statistical analyses will be done using R or python. We will examine relationships between these factors and alcohol consumption using Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables), overall and stratified by ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors, for example, demographics.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that alcohol consumption behaviors will be associated with factors including demographics, personal and family health history, socioeconomic factors,  lifestyle factors, and social determinants of health, with ALDH2 genotype and potentially other factors. While a limited number of U.S. studies among university students have shown that ALDH2*2 homozygotes tend to avoid alcohol, many ALDH2 heterozygotes do consume alcohol, albeit at lower levels. There have been no studies examining alcohol consumption behaviors by ALDH2 genotype conducted outside the university setting in the U.S. The All of Us Research Program presents a valuable source of data from study participants across the U.S. which would enable the study of alcohol consumption behaviors in the context of genomics.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This is an exploratory workspace, the first I have attempted, to help me get familiar with All of Us Research methods.  At the same time, it will investigate a real research question:
""Is treatment of type 2 diabetes with Metformin (as opposed to no treatment)  associated with the incidence of infectious diseases such as COVID, flu, Lyme disease, or Zoster?""
My hypothesis is that Metformin is protective, and this effect may or may not be mediated by lowering HbA1c levels.
This question is important, because over 37 million Americans (not to mention other people around the world) have type 2 diabetes, and there is evidence that this puts them at risk for greater incidence of and/or more severe infectious disease. Does Metformin lower their risk?","Project Purpose(s)

I will build a cohort of participants with type 2 diabetes, excluding pre-diabetics and type 1 diabetics.  The exposure of interest will be Metformin treatment (yes/no) throughout the study period. Outcomes of interest will be time from baseline to incidence of COVID 19, influenza, Lyme Disease, and shingles. I will use a Cox Proportional Hazards model to test for difference between participants on Metformin and those not. Lab values for HbA1c levels (mean of all tests during period?) will also be tested for a mediation effect if the primary hypothesis proves true. I will gather demographic variables to be included in the models as covariates: age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income and education level, if available.  Depending on results, I may test some general health indicators, like cardiovascular disease, as potential confounders or effect modifiers.","Anticipated Findings

Why does the large food consumption cause more adolescent African-American males to have type two diabetes than Caucasian males as grown adults?
This question is important because in some of our families, people are obese, and trying to lose weight sometimes is problematic. We are wondering if obesity can be genetically inherited or is just acquired by bad eating habits. To determine this, we plan to look through the database and determine whether our question is correct.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
The hypothesis is testable since we can take an obese African American individual with type 2 diabetes and compare them to an obese person without type 2 diabetes. We can see if the individual carries the gene and if it is genetically inherited by looking at their parent’s 20th chromosome on their karyotype as well as their own. Research shows that African Americans are more susceptible to having type 2 diabetes while being obese compared to Caucasians. This hypothesis can be fallible because type 2 diabetes isn’t 100% genetically inherited, but genetics play a significant role in its development. It may just be developed due to obesity and has nothing to do with being genetically inherited.","Anticipated Findings
If an African-American male (ages 8-16) without type 2 diabetes is obese, they are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than a Caucasian male (ages 8-16) who is obese without type 2 diabetes.
If an African American male (ages 8-16) without type 2 diabetes is obese, they have a lower probability of developing type 2 diabetes than a Caucasian male who is obese without type 2 diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Statistical study: Observational-In this study we will look at Af Ams with diabetes and their corresponding income level, then compare those from a lower income level to those of a higher one. We will repeat this for Af Ams with diabetes and their corresponding education, environment, and employment. Finally we compare the impact of income level to that of the other socioeconomic factors

The anticipated finding is that low income will not be the leading socioeconomic factor increasing the risk of diabetes in African Americans. Finding this to be true will allow for further research on the impact of other socioeconomic factors, like environment, education, and employment, on diabetes within the same demographic. Finding it to be false enables more research on the influences of low income itself. Diabetes within the black community is a health disparity that needs to be addressed with more concern.

Most of our traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. This research focuses on the genetic contributions and in particular on those to different disease risks. What regions of our DNA affect which traits and how much? Can we use DNA to identify individuals at high risk for a certain disease and take preventive measures early or perhaps even before an onset of the disease? For many diseases, such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease, the answer to this question is already yes. By looking at up to tens of thousands DNA locations, specific to each disease, it is possible to estimate the genetic disease risk. These predictions are not exact but are good enough to already be used clinically saving lives and limiting the severity of diseases. The main purpose of this project is to develop and validate methods to make such risk predictions from DNA and to make this technology equally available to all of us, regardless of our genetic backgrounds.","Project Purpose(s)

Commercial","Scientific Approaches
This research project is using various machine learning algorithms (computer programs), such as L1-penalized regression, elastic nets, Bayesian regressions, random forests, and neural networks. All of them require large datasets with genetic information paired with different phenotypes, e.g. disease status, blood pressure, past surgeries, etc. The phenotypes are either used as ""the answer"", what you try to teach the algorithm to predict, or other factors that you are trying to compensate for (e.g. if you are trying to predict blood pressure, you may want to correct for use of blood thinning medications). The data needs to be quality controlled and prepared for effective analysis which involves a multitude of statistical tools, including principal component analyses, data transformations and subsampling. Where available, we will also use sibling analyses. Siblings typically share childhood environments making the such data particularly useful for studies of the genetic effects.","Anticipated Findings
The validation aspect of the project will tell us how well already existing predictors (trained on other datasets) are performing. This evaluation on a completely independent dataset is the best way to get an honest measure of how well the predictor works (metrics we use are primarily AUC, variation explained, correlation, and odds ratios). The extraordinary advantage All of Us has is its diversity which will provide answers about the predictor performance not only on the subpopulations used for training but on populations from very different ancestries, environments and lifestyles. This is an invaluable tool to characterize and minimize performance differences that historically have arisen due to skewed data availability.
The validation results will guide the development phase which will yield new methods, predictors and tools to combine different types of information for the most accurate disease risk and health predictions possible, for each one of us.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The purpose of this exploratory analysis is descriptive. Many population-based cohort studies have a single assessment of oral diseases and it's unclear how oral diseases might be affecting other chronic health conditions over time if it does not remain at the same level of severity.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been decade after decade the greatest infectious disease killer globally. 1.6 million died in 2021.
Diagnosis, lack of access to healthcare, difficulty adhering to and completing regimens, and other comorbidities (HIV, diabetes, cancer, immunosuppression such as for autoimmune disorders) worsen TB outcomes. TB in the US is often in those who are foreign born, those who are older, associated with lack of housing or incarceration, and those with other comorbidities.
We will track the demographics of those diagnosed with TB, while also identifying modifiable risk factors - such as untreated HIV, untreated latent TB, uncontrolled diabetes, and immunosuppression.","Project Purpose(s)

Educational","Scientific Approaches
Using the ALL of US full cohort, we can help determine the associations of some of these factors which would have been modifiable. Such modifiable risk factors would include: HIV without any or consistent HIV (ART) treatment, use of prednisone or common immunosuppressive drugs before the onset of TB (note TB treatment can include prednisone which should not be considered a risk), poorly controlled diabetes (stratified by hemoglobin a1c or in those insulin dependent without Hga1c recorded), known latent TB (quantiferon, T-spot, or Mantoux positivity) without latent TB treatment. We will also assess the timeframe of who has been assessed for latent TB before or with TB diagnosis and how many are not treated for latent TB, especially in those with another risk factor.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to identify any gaps in latent TB screening and treatment, while also highlighting any gaps in HIV and diabetes care, as well as care for those who are immunocompromised. We hope to better understand who is at risk for TB, including basic demographics, but also modifiable medical risk factors which may track with social determinants of health.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The temporal sequence of events will be identified by counting for each pair of the condition (diabetes), the number of times it occurs before another in the same person. We will use the pairwise count of one condition occurring before another to establish the sequence of occurrence of conditions.
A causal network will be built in order to better understand and predict the response variable, diabetes. We will use LASSO regression to regress the response variable on all independent variables, and pairwise or triple clusters of independent variables that precede the response variable. We will regress each variable that is a direct predictor of response/outcome variable on all preceding variables (demographic and conditions).
Using Netica we will map the network. We will estimate the parameters and calculate the predicted vale for all combinations of the parents in the Markov blanket of the response variable with the use of LASSO regression.","Anticipated Findings

EHR diagnosis codes use for billing are known to be rife with inaccuracies. For example, a patient may be evaluated for diabetes mellitus but then have a diabetes mellitus code assigned to their chart. As a result, using the structured diagnosis codes in an analysis may give inaccurate conclusions. For large genetic studies, one way to improve the code accuracy is to only consider patients as having the disease as those with at least two diagnosis codes on different days. There are other simple heuristics that could be applied to improve accuracy across various disease by incorporating temporal patterns of various features. This project aims to study these temporal patterns to see if there is a rule that can be used to improve the accuracy of identifying patients with specific diseases.","Project Purpose(s)

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes caused by a single highly penetrant variant. A majority of MODY cases are caused by pathogenic variants in three genes: HNF1A, HNF4A and GCK. The prevalence and penetrance of pathogenic variants in MODY-associated genes is still relatively unclear. Proper identification and diagnosis of MODY is important as the condition has treatment implications differ from other forms of diabetes . For example, first line treatment for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY subtypes is sulfonylureas vs. insulin in type 1 or metformin in type 2. For GCK-MODY, pharmacologic treatment is unnecessary except in some cases. The goals of this project are two-fold. We are interested in better understanding the prevalence and penetrance of these variants in the AoU cohort. We are interested in understanding how well treatments prescribed match clinical guidelines indicated by genetic etiology for  those with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic MODY variant.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) )
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will identify individuals in the cohort with a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in one of the MODY-associated genes using classifications from the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel for Variation Curation, which is a group of physicians, geneticists, and laboratory pathologists that work on MODY.   From the eligible individuals, we will look at diagnosis of diabetes, age of diagnosis, family history of diabetes, and treatment information. We will be using methods for penetrance estimate based on previous work by Mirshahi et al. 2022 (PMID 36257325). Because of phenotypic and onset differences between HNF1A/HNF4A MODY and GCK MODY, we will use two separate methodologies to estimate penetrance. To estimate the penetrance of diabetes for those with a HNF1A or HNF4A variant, we will use Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. For those with a GCK variant, we will use Fisher’s exact test to estimate the penetrance for mild hyperglycemia.","Anticipated Findings
By gaining an estimate for the prevalence and penetrance of known MODY-associated variants, we will have a better understanding of how common these variants are in the population and how likely a variant will result in disease.   Although there has been previous work done in this area, it has been completed predominately in White-European cohorts  and, to our knowledge, not in a healthy US cohort. Through this project, we will be able to gain insights regarding MODY variants in diverse groups living in the United States. By analyzing treatments being used for MODY, we will be able to understand the current clinical landscape for MODY and identify potential areas of improvement. We hope that this work will lead to a better understanding of the presence of MODY-associated variants in the US and better improve health outcomes for individuals with this condition.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related health traits using the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. People diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid health conditions, for example, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions.

Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with comorbid health conditions vs. people only with/out a mental disorder. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects 5.7 million Americans. It is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults and the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 or older. ADRD is devastating for individuals and families financially and emotionally. Identifying both individual and combined risk factors of ADRD and evaluating the impact of comorbidities on cognitive impairment is essential to improve cognitive health of older adults. Diabetes and poor oral health are common among older adults and both are risk factors for ADRD.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study is the first to examine the joint effect (additive or interactions) of both DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, and the pathways from the co-occurrence to the onset of ADRD and mortality. Specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine the relationship between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the incidence of ADRD using a propensity matched sample within the study period. Aim 2: To examine the association between the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health and the age of first diagnosis of ADRD among persons who developed ADRD during the study period. Aim 3: To test the pathways from the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health to the onset of ADRD by examining the mediation effect of key mediating variables (i.e., CVD and stroke developed after baseline).","Anticipated Findings
The proposed study is the first to examine the effect of the co-occurrence of DM and poor oral health on ADRD and mortality, using large national samples. The proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of the risk profile of ADRD by providing important empirical evidence on the combined risk of both DM and oral health for ADRD. Further, it may identify modifiable factors that can serve as targets to reduce the risk of ADRD. The findings will have important implications for clinical practice and policy initiatives for integrating primary care and dental care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Methods Development
Control Set
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The scientific approaches that we plan to use for this study, is breaking our inquiry down into 3 specific parts. The first would be recording how genes encoded for this disease are inherited, and their mode of transmission. For that we need to look at pedigrees or flowcharts showing a typical scenario of how an individual could inherit this condition, and compare those probabilities to other unusual scenarios. For example, an offspring may be the carrier for the gene that encodes for diabetes, but may never experience it, due to their lifestyle choices. The other two parts of this research will focus on analyzing complex genes that encode for this condition and how environmental factors affect the mutation rate of these genes and the expression of them over different populations in different environments, regardless of income, or race, but more focusing on type of environment (urban/rural), access to resources, and age.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings in this study would be to unravel the difficulty behind the diagnosis of this disease. Though diabetes is directly related insulin resistance, it wears many hats that we do not know of. It can be a comorbidity to an autoimmune illness, developed by an unhealthy lifestyle, or diagnosed in the neonatal development of the offspring. By drawing connections and analyzing these findings, we can deduce why diabetes can be an apparent risk to anyone regardless of their health circumstances good or bad. Our scientific knowledge can contribute to the field of genetics research and disease, in the fact that it can help produce a possible solution in how we pinpoint its growth.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Unmodeled heterogeneity of the biological underpinnings of phenotypes reduces statistical power and reproducibility in downstream analyses such as genome-wide association studies. While some complex diseases have well-established clinically-relevant subtypes that respond differently to different treatments (e.g., diabetes and asthma), heterogeneity is suspected but has not so far been demonstrated for many other phenotypes. Existing data-driven subtyping methods primarily rely on data clustering methods that are not guaranteed to capture genetically- or clinically-relevant stratification of patients, thus, impeding our ability to take an important step towards personalized medicine by defining treatment at the subphenotypic level. The goal of this proposal is to enable a robust identification of clinically-relevant subphenotypic variation given no prior knowledge.","Project Purpose(s)

The extent to which genetic and non-genetic factors as a whole contribute to potential risk of CKD in adults is not well quantified. For example, while much literature exists on APOL1 risk alleles primarily in individuals of African ancestry, APOL1 appears to be most strongly associated with FSGS and HIV nephropathy rather than CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension, which account for a greater proportion of all kidney disease.

Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between dental infections (as consequence of dental caries and pulp necrosis) and additional diseases (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) although limitations of such studies hamper conclusive interpretations . We showed that apical periodontitis (pulp necrosis with bone resorption) was strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease; further, we identified an association between an established hypertension-associated gene with apical periodontitis in a well-characterized population. These findings strongly indicate that a shared genetic etiology could contribute to oral health-systemic health relationships. By using All of Us data, we hope to validate our previous findings and expand knowledge of the etiology linking oral health and systemic health. We will identify additional factors (social determinants of health) that may play a role in the interconnectedness between oral health and general health.","Project Purpose(s)

Data available via All of Us research workbench shows 20 dental infection conditions that reflect a continuum of dental infection (i.e., dental caries, pulpal and periapical conditions) of interest.

We will access demographic, clinical (dental and medical) and genetic data from individuals with the above conditions (no exclusions based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or genetic ancestry). We will test for association between a set of conditions, and will also identify potential genes/variants associated with a combined phenotype of dental infection + systemic condition using a variety of tools and statistical methods. All of Us data will allow us to identify a large sample of unrelated controls to increase confidence in the results.","Anticipated Findings
Much of the controversial findings in epidemiological and genetic association studies looking at oral/dental and systemic conditions is due to differences in populations studied, data ascertainment methodologies, but mainly due to limited sample sizes. This study will leverage high-quality demographic/clinical and genomic data of a large and diverse dataset that will allow the best (largest) evidence to date.

By identifying if there are common signaling pathways in platelets and insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells among other disease-related cells, this research is relevant in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of such disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
In order to answer the questions as posed above, we will build a cohort with patients who have lab values of platelets [#/volume] in blood. Then, we will sort by those with and without the following disorders distinguished by the specific ICD-10 codes. If a correlation is found between abnormal counts of platelets and single diseases, we will then further look at if there are relationships between having multiple diseases and platelet count. As this is an initial look to see general relationships, we will look to see if there are differences between gender and age.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find (1) an abnormal platelet count in patients with diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease; (2) for patients with multiple conditions, that their platelet counts are influenced by the multiple conditions that they have; (3) that there is a relationship in signaling pathways among these disorders; (4) that the signaling pathways used by these diseases are influenced by each other.
These findings would contribute as by assessing how diseases can affect platelet count can lead to earlier diagnoses for patients. Furthermore, since these disorders use common pathways to operate, the understanding of how each works can lead to improved treatment as well.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures. The results will demonstrate whether COVID-19 infection increased economic, job, and health access disparities among Hispanic participants.","Project Purpose(s)

We will produce data visualization of key results and build logistic regression models predicting ethnicity build using the selected variables of COVID-19 infection and related social determinants of health.  Appropriate interactions will be included to produce a model with explanatory power and parsimonious fit.","Anticipated Findings
1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as type-2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease has dramatically increased in the last two generations. One source of rising prevalence has been argued to be decanalization, a special class of genotype-by-environment interactions to study the evolution of human wellness with respect to changing environment. The recent lifestyle and behavioral shifts such as sedentary nature, low physical activity or socioeconomic disparities lead to increase in genetic effects on the disease over time. Here we ask the question – how the rapid cultural shifts of the modern environment interact with polygenic risk and influence disease susceptibility.  We previously sought evidence of this process through a comparison of prevalence of phenotypes as a function of polygenic scores with respect to environments across complex traits and common diseases and aim to replicate our findings as well as extend the methods.","Project Purpose(s)

We will then quantify the deviations of risk at the extremes of polygenic scores to quantify the impact of disease in low- vs high-risk environment.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that our findings will have implications in the implementation of polygenic risk assessment in precision medicine. Confirmed polygenic risk score-by-environmental interactions across common disease and complex traits will point towards high-risk environments impacting disease risk.

Disease Focused Research (prediabetes syndrome)","Scientific Approaches
In this cross-sectional study, we will use information from the electronic medical record (EMR) and survey responses from adults (age 18+). We will query the EMR for hemoglobin A1c measurements (HbA1c), and EMR diagnoses of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The population will be stratified by diabetes status based on EMR data: no diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%), prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c > 6.4%).

Type 2 diabetes is attached with many associated metabolic traits of obesity, inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperglycemia. These traits have been seen as well-known risk factors for breast cancer. One of the most prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs metformin has been utilized in many treatments in breast cancer patients during and prior to diagnosis. These associations provided a strong rationale to study the association of metformin use in clinical care of women with breast cancer, particularly due to the nature of insulin. In addition, changes derived from insulin resistance in patients with metformin use have been involved in tumor development, aggressiveness, treatment response, and poorer prognosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of patients with breast carcinoma in association to prior metformin use in histological phenotypes of African, Hispanics, and Asian American Populations in the United States.","Project Purpose(s)

Assess the performance of a commonly used prediction model of diabetes complications in a more diverse population.
The risk engine from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) is built into the vast majority of clinical and economic decision models currently used in the US, despite considerable limitations: UKPDS began in 1977, is based on a cohort 5,100 British diabetics, and minority groups typical in US patient populations were not represented at all. In addition, relationships between predictors and health outcomes are likely to have changed over the past 40 years in which there were large changes in health risks as well as treatments. This workspace analyzes trajectories of diabetes complications for underrepresented groups and contrasts it to predictions from the UKPDS.","Project Purpose(s)

We will conduct a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of family history of common chronic diseases in diverse All of Us participants. We will also investigate the risk of various chronic diseases based on reporting a  family history of the same disease or other diseases. We will investigate factors associated with increased familial risks such as age of onset of disease, number of affected relatives and other covariates. Family history is considered one of the most important risk factors for health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and other chronic conditions. Even though many researchers have studied risk of family history of few chronic conditions, the family history module of All of Us research data set contains 104 different conditions that can be analyzed to assess familial risk in more details.","Project Purpose(s)

For this study, we expect to show the percentage of survey participants with a family history of chronic disease out of those who have that disease and the association of the chronic disease with the family history of that disease. Each year since 2004, the Surgeon General has declared Thanksgiving to be National Family History Day, and encourages Americans to use his ""My Family Health Portrait"" which is an internet-based tool that makes it easy to record family health history. However, information on family health history on currently available surveys are limited to few chronic diseases.

Diabetes remains an overwhelming public health burden in the United States with the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes reaching an estimated 8.7% of the adult population in 2019. Among patient with DM, cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Importantly, the burden of disease is not shared equally across the population; racial and socioeconomic disparities are evident in recent DM data.
The goal of this project is to use the All of Us Research Program database to explore racial and socioeconomic disparities in composite CVD risk factor control amongDM patients with and without CVD. We want to know 1. Among patients with diabetes mellitus with and without CVD, what is the extent of composite risk factor control (BP, HbA1c, LDL-C, BMI, tobacco status, activity level? 2. How is race, ethnicity, sex, income, and healthcare access associated with number of risk factors at target for control?","Project Purpose(s)

Understanding the spectrum risks found in persons with diabetes and ASCVD in a contemporary cohort of US adults can help target the intensity of therapeutic approaches to prevent future adverse outcomes.
The project will examine the following questions:
1.	Within those with diabetes, how many are higher risk (two or more risk factors) and within those with ASCVD how many are at very high risk according to the recent 2018 cholesterol guidelines?
2.	Among these higher versus lower risk patients with ASCVD and DM, what is the adherence to non-smoking, healthy diet, and regular physical activity?
3.	Among these groups, what is the proportion at target for BP (<130/80 mmHg), LDL-C (< 70 mg/dl if CVD, <100 mg/dl otherwise), HbA1c (<8% if with CVD or <7% if not)?

Insulin pump systems offer improved glycemic control and reduced morbidity and mortality in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In recent years, insulin pumps have increasingly been paired with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to automate insulin delivery and reduce user input. Significant barriers to diabetes technologies–including cost, access, and provider knowledge–limit uptake. Similar barriers also likely exist for the use of oral antihyperglycemic medications that require investigation of insulin resistance profiles in patients receiving care at specialized centers. The goal of this study is to identify socioeconomic disparities in T1DM management in a large national cohort. Specifically, we aim to (1) characterize insulin pump system use across race/ethnicity among patients in the United States, (2) characterize insulin pump complications among patients in the United States, and (3) characterize oral anti-hyperglycemic medicationn use in T1DM using the All of Us database.","Project Purpose(s)

Due to the far-reaching effects of metabolic dysregulation, the All of Us dataset makes it possible for us to examine PASK, USF1, and ATXN2 variants on various phenotypes and disorders.
PAS Kinase (PASK) is a protein that responds to glucose availability and regulates glucose metabolism in yeast, mice, and humans. Metabolic issues contribute to diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Publications have shown a relationship between conditions such as those listed above and PASK. Our research aims to find genetic associations between PASK and two of its substrates with various disease phenotypes. We will accomplish this using data provided by the All of Us dataset, which includes lab measurements and whole genome sequencing. We will perform a linear regression analysis to find associations between PASK gene variants among diverse ancestries to find new trends and associations between various metabolic issues and phenotypical expression.","Project Purpose(s)
Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We propose to discover associations between USF1, ATXN2, and PASK to analyze their variation in conjunction with blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, blood count, lipid panels, and urinalysis using the All of Us dataset.
We will utilize the All of Us dataset to find associations between PASK, USF1, and ATXN2and their phenotypes in diverse ancestry groups. Regression analyses will present our findings.
Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) will look at common and rare variants found in the PASK, USF1, and ATXN2. Using diverse data, we can better indicate significant variations between these genes and make applicable findings for all people. Efforts to ensure ancestrally varying datasets improve contributions made in medicine to make progress towards personalized care. European, African, Asian, and Hispanic populations are all included in the All of Us dataset, which will guarantee more accurate associations made in our study.","Anticipated Findings
Our final goal will be to show associations between these three genes of interest with disease phenotypes. We expect to see significant phenotype-gene associations in various areas due to the central nature of lipid and respiratory metabolism and the role of their dysregulation in many diseases.   We will publish our findings in a peer-reviewed article which will be part of a more extensive publication. The publication will include information from the genome-wide association study described in this proposal. It will also include data collected from a phenome-wide association study, identifying associated disease phenotypes for PASK, USF1, and ATXN2. Next fall, I will present the data as a poster at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG).

I want to understand how we decide what type of health care to get and when. My premise is that we seek care that has value to us... meaning achieving a desired outcome at an acceptable cost but value for an individual may differ from value for a health system.
Aim 1 :  Determine predictors for utilizing health care resources and determine if use of different resources leads to differential health outcomes
For example, does using Urgent Care versus Primary care affect health outcomes for individuals with different health backgrounds?
Aim 2 : Recreate nationally used quality metrics for the All of Us population and determine benchmarks for these measures.
A simple example would be patients with diabetes whose hemoglobin A1C is higher than a standard.

This project will have a longitudinal, natural experiment design as we plan to look at changes from the initial questionnaire to the follow-up.. We will control for various demographic, social, and genetic factors to infer causality.
We will use data from the EHR domains, genomics, physical measurements and the survey categories of family health history, SDOH, overall health, and lifestyle to examine factors influencing participants' health outcomes.
We will use R to analyze the data. We will calculate descriptive, bivariate, and inferential statistics to describe the population and measure outcomes of interest. The focus is on multivariate, fixed effects regression, with basic and augmented models. The study will include two main regressions, A) estimating the effects of environmental exposure on gene expression, and B) estimating the effects of changes in gene expression on health outcomes.
The outcome measures are epigenetic changes and mental and physical health outcomes.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that degree of exposure to adverse environmental conditions will have a positive association with extent and severity of epigenetic changes. Additionally, we hypothesize that these epigenetic changes will be positively associated with extent and severity of poor physical and mental health outcomes. We expect to find that these effects are mitigated by upward socioeconomic mobility.
This research project fills a gap in the current literature by analyzing epigenetic data through a social science lens and combining epigenetic information with environmental exposure in populations with similar genetic information. Applying social science methods to this topic increases the external validity of this research because it combines field-based data with laboratory data. While much social science public health research analyzes associations between SDOH and health outcomes, this paper looks to examine the biological pathways by which these associations occur.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Is covid-19 and its relationship to diabetes in Hispanic/Latino communities different among different genders, geographical areas or wealth brackets?
Is there reverse causality between Ethnicity and Diabetes and Covid-19?
Covid-19 has had a catastrophic effect resulting in more than 6 million deaths.  It has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy.
Type 2 diabetes is an expanding global health problem. Individuals with T2DM are at high risk for both microvascular complications and macrovascular complications owing to hyperglycaemia and individual components of the insulin resistance syndrome.
Recent literature suggested that the rate of T2Dm are unusually high in specifically Hispanic/Latino populations with Covid-19.  What are the underlying reasons?","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Initially part of an AILA challenge.  )","Scientific Approaches
We will initially use the NIH dataset for the challenge.  We will do a power analysis for hispanic/latino populations and perhaps turn the paneled data into longitudinal data.  We will join the data on subject and look for what combination of useful independent variables give enough power for both covid-19 and diabetes in hispanic populations.  We may then conflate the fitbit data into means and variance per day of certain readings and also look at specific  .  We may do some initial exploratory analysis on the social determinants with pearson correlations between hispanic/latino and caucasian with both covid-19 and t2dm.  PCA and  TSNE as well.  We can then try fitting a neural network with attention and saliency maps on both stages and/or trying an instrumental variable regression.","Anticipated Findings
We hope to see a relationship between doctor prescription of diabetic medication and income in hispanic populations.  There is sometimes a large amount of prescriptions in EHR data (usable) that go un-used due to income issues.  We also wonder if employment and/or distance traveled to work is an underlying factor in this spike in type 2 diabetes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Determine the association of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the screening patterns of GDM.
Increasing the effectiveness of healthcare by improving patient experience, outcomes, overall population health, and reducing healthcare costs is at the heart of U.S. healthcare quality improvement (Berwick, D. M, et al 2017). Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity continue to pose significant problems in healthcare for non-Hispanic black Americans. Billions of dollars are spent each year on medical resources and lost productivity. However, GDM is not well studied to mitigate its contribution to the increase of T2DM. For instance, the global burden of disease only includes GDM within “other maternal disorders” (Other maternal disorders - level 2 cause 2020). With the increase in minority and older populations, it is necessary to identify the optimal screening method for GDM by addressing upstream social determinants of health that prevent screening for GDM.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Educational","Scientific Approaches
We will conduct a binary logistic regression analysis to assess if the independent variables – patients' demographic and socioeconomic predict the dependent variable – when GDM was screened (Normal – 0 and Early – 1). Binary logistic regression is used for studies where the dependent variable is a categorical variable with a dichotomous outcome (Pituch and Stevens, 2015).
The reference category will be Normal (GDM screening between 24th to 28th weeks of gestation). The analysis will be done at the individual level. Odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p-value will be presented for the outcome variable. The analysis will be done with SAS Student edition software.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that there will be a difference in how women screen for GDM between race/ethnic groups as well as between socioeconomic groups. By identifying how upstream factors (Social determinants of health) impact population health, we might be able to propose strategies that are both cost-saving and effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

C-Reactive  Protein  (CRP)  level  is  commonly used to index inflammatory response to both acute and chronic conditions. Previous work has observed elevated CRP levels in individuals with a variety of conditions, including obesity, diabetes and major depression as well as in response to environmental toxins, such as tobacco use. Other work suggests a protective effect of cannabis use on CRP levels. It is unknown to what extent this ""protective"" effect holds under heavy or persistent use, with preliminary evidence suggesting a reversal of this effect in individuals with cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, current research has failed to consider if this seemingly causal association may  be confounded by comorbid traits such as major depression, cardiovascular disease, or asthma. We aim to explore the association between cannabis use measures and CRP (and potentially other relevant biomarkers) in All of Us, as preliminary, exploratory research used to inform future grant proposals.","Project Purpose(s)

The scientific questions we are going to study are:
Are there differences in mechanisms responsible for the development and outcomes of cancer between diabetics and non-diabetics?
Do diabetic treatments delay/excel the onset of cancer?
This is important because the number of patients with diabetes is increasing, and if there are different mechanisms by which patients with diabetes develop cancer, we can create tailored treatments for these patients.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Type 2 diabetes, cancer)","Scientific Approaches
We will create a dataset of patients with diabetes who develop cancer and a dataset of patients without diabetes who develop cancer. We will data mine variables that are associated with diabetes risk assessment, such as BMI, A1C, blood glucose, age, etc., for both cohorts. We will use logistic regression models to understand which variables are significant to cancer development for both cohorts, and also use supervised machine learning models to predict cancer development using our variables for different types of cancers. We will also data mine diabetic medications and conduct survival analyses to determine if there are specific treatments that work better/worse for different cancers.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate there will be different variables effecting the development of cancer for diabetics and non-diabetics. Also, we believe diabetics on certain medications, such as metformin, could possibly have better outcomes than healthy patients not taking medications. Our findings would demonstrate different mechanisms by which cancer can develop, and show the necessity to change patient care based on diabetic status.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This project aims to understand etiologic mechanisms underlying comorbidity of mental disorders and related traits through the analysis of large-scale phenotype and genotype data. Psychiatry is the only medical field that defines disorders without pathologic evidence. Clinical symptoms often overlap across different diagnoses, while comorbidity is the norm rather than an exception. In particular, people diagnosed with mental disorders are at greater risk of developing comorbid physical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. People with comorbid medical conditions, especially involving both mental and physical disorders, also suffer from greater burden of symptom severity, functional disability, and increased mortality. Yet, we have limited understanding of the etiological bases of such comorbid conditions. In this project, we aim to investigate: (1) the prevalence of comorbidity; and (2) risk factors associated with various comorbid medical conditions.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
First, we will use ICD10 or ICD9 code to identify mental disorders with the prevalence greater than 2.5%.
Second, for the identified mental disorders, we will identify comorbidity between mental disorders (e.g., depression and ADHD), and that with physical conditions (e.g., depression and hypertension).
Third, for each of the mental disorders (e.g., depression), we will examine demographic, family history, genetics, and lifestyle measures that are more common among people with depression and comorbid conditions vs. people only with depression vs. people without depression. Multiple regression will be used to estimate the effect of the examined risk factors, while accounting for age, sex, and top ten genetic components for population substructure.
This analysis will be conducted within each population and examined for heterogeneity across different populations.
Software: Our analysis will be conducted using R, PLINK, PRSCSX, PRSICE, and shell scripts.","Anticipated Findings
There are two public health benefits. First, our findings will provide critical insights into potential etiologic relationships between distinct comorbid medical conditions. Previous studies have focused on examining a pair of comorbid disorders, while our study findings will examine multiple comorbid conditions. Secondly, our study findings will identify risk/resilience factors related to comorbid medical conditions. Treating people with comorbid disorders has been a major challenge, especially, those with both mental and physical conditions. Identification of risk/resilience factors will form a critical basis for risk prediction and personalized intervention strategies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

It’s estimated 5 million of the 18 million americans in the US with diabetes do not know they have it. Early diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes is important so that patients can begin to manage the disease early and potentially prevent or delay the serious disease complications that can decrease quality of life. Some of these complications include premature heart disease and stroke, blindness, limb amputations, and kidney failure. Our project will review clinical data to estimate each patient’s diabetes risk, which will help identify high risk individuals who may need to seek medical attention.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
Given the importance of being able to correctly give early diagnosis, this team places a stronger importance for our model on predictive performance, which leads the team to initially lean towards using random forest or boosting (particularly XGBoost) models.  These more complex models might not be as interpretable, and take longer to run, but they generally yield a much higher out-of-sample performance, which is the main goal of this team’s project.  The team will also look into how well a CART model performs with the dataset given that a CART tree, if it is not too complex, would offer that interpretability for the end users of this research project.  It is important to note that a CART model would be used in lieu of a more complex model if it performs on par with the more complex models.","Anticipated Findings
The overall goal of the project is to assist doctors with treating patients. Ideally, the data analysis would provide doctors with a model of what age range a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on his/her risk factors. If we can provide doctors with this information, then they can have a conversation with patients about preventative care, such as lifestyle changes, in advance of that age to try to prevent patients from developing diabetes. It also allows doctors to know when to start testing patients’ A1C levels to diagnose diabetes so the disease can be treated as quickly as possible. This prevents the untreated disease from wreaking havoc on the patients’ bodies, preventing complications from diabetes down the line.","Demographic Categories of Interest

People who have diabetes are more likely to develop several eye diseases or conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and open-angle glaucoma. For people who have diabetes, it is important to get regular comprehensive dilated eye exam to identify these conditions and have early treatment.

The long term goal of our work is to improve the diagnosis and clinical management of diabetes subtypes by translating recent advances in our understanding of genetic risk factors for diabetes.  We study the role of rare and common genetic variants in diabetes type 1, type 2, and subtypes of monogenic diabetes. We use genetic data in combination with clinical and other variables to develop risk models to better identify individuals with diabetes subtypes.  We test the utility of previously developed genetic risk scores for type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the MyCode cohort and determine the impact of rare disease-associated genetic variants.  The Allofus cohort will allow us to validate and refine our findings from admixed ancestry in a  large diverse population.   We will develop tools to better diagnose diabetes subtypes in individuals of all ancestries including European and non-Europeans  (African American, admixed American. Asian/Pacific Islander).","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to validate and refine genetic risk scores for diabetes subtypes and examine rare and common variant contribution to type 1 and type 2 diabetes in association studies.  We also plan to develop risk models for diabetes subtypes, including monogenic diabetes using machine learning approaches.","Anticipated Findings
We plan to use data from Allofus to validate findings from the MyCode cohort, in particular, findings from admixed populations.  Overall, we anticipate being able to validate the grs findings from the MyCode cohort and the Allofus cohort.  We will be able to compare pathogenic variants of monogenic diabetes between the cohorts and ascertain phenotypic spectrum, prevalence, and penetrance of diabetes genes.  We will use the Allofus population to validate any risk models developed.
Achieving our goals will lead to possibility of further genetic studies into the phenotype, progression and complications of diabetes subtypes.  The risk models for diabetes subtypes will be provided freely on a server and available for clinicians to use.

We are interested in the conditions that accompany obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are conditions that are risk factors for OSA, so we expect to see those prior to a diagnosis of the sleep problem. There are also many comorbidities of OSA, such as cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and diabetes. We believe that there may be mechanisms underlying OSA and these comorbidities that are present before diagnosis. We therefore want to look at when co-occurring conditions occur before and after a diagnosis of OSA. We also wish to assess those conditions in people without OSA as a comparison.","Project Purpose(s)

We will look at the conditions commonly associated with OSA (CV disease, mental health, etc) in people without indication of a sleep disorder, and see whether the timeline and severity differs with the OSA group.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to see conditions occurring prior to a diagnosis of OSA.

The aim of this study is to investigate if Pyridoxine use can benefit diabetics in preventing long term complications by inhibiting formation of activated glycation end products and improving clinical outcomes.
Diabetes and hyperglycemia are affecting over 415 million people worldwide, and by 2040 the number is expected to increase to 642 million. Chronic hyperglycemia results in the glycation of proteins and other biomolecules resulting in generation of AGEs. Glycation can be identified as the core reason for diabetes associated disorders. The interaction of AGEs with their receptor elicits oxidative stress and as a result evokes proliferative, inflammatory, thrombotic and fibrotic reactions in a variety of cells. Therefore, inhibiting the glycation process might be an effective way to prevent the complications of chronic hyperglycemia.","Project Purpose(s)

The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is incompletely understood.

Access to large datasets with genetic and clinical phenotypic information provide an ideal opportunity to conduct analyses that might improve our understanding of T2D and related traits, particularly within underserved or underrepresented populations.

To achieve these goals, we plan on performing association analyses between T2D-related traits and genetic variants typed in the All of Us cohort, extending our previous work on the genetics of T2D to diverse populations. We will also test whether the variants associated with these traits, or risk scores that combine genetic and phenotypic variables, also impact related traits/outcomes, to further characterize the impact of these variants or the disease subtypes described by them on health. We will use combinations of traits and Mendelian randomization techniques to assess causality between traits.

The purpose is to 1) explore the available data in order to 2) investigate whether we can observe trends between respiratory diseases (e.g. sleep apnea) and the development of age-related cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both have in common cardiovascular factors (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attacks). If brain functioning is interrupted by abnormal blood flow, this might contribute to a faster decay with aging. The hypothesis is that respiratory problems can be observed first, followed by cardiovascular problems and that a subset of the population with these health problems will eventually develop AD. It is critical to explore this connection because it might lead to the investigation and development of preventative breathing interventions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Respiratory conditions and the risk of Alzheimer's Disease)","Scientific Approaches
First of all, my goal is to identify which variables could be useful for this purpose. For example, an important correlational analysis would be between the number of years since diagnosis of a respiratory disorder and the onset of mild cognitive impairment or AD. It is also of interest, what percentage of people with AD have a history of cardiovascular risk and/or breathing difficulties. For the participants that have not yet developed AD, it will be useful to understand whether they show the same or worse cognitive performance compared to people without this breathing disorder and whether this is still the case for those with breathing abnormalities AND cardiovascular risk.
For this purpose, I will include data on age, cognitive function, cardiovascular health, breathing-related and cognitive impairment/AD diagnoses and the time and age of the diagnoses. Control variables will be sex, education, physical activity, socioeconomic background and potentially history of medication use.","Anticipated Findings
I anticipate to find that compared to healthy controls, people with sleep apnea show reduced cognitive functioning. I anticipate this to worsen the longer they have suffered from sleep apnea. In addition, I expect that cardiovascular risk factors will further reduce cognitive functions. This effect may be ameliorated by people who are more physically active, have higher education and a higher socioeconomic status. There might be age and sex differences. Most importantly, I expect that people with AD may have a worse disease course if they also have a history of sleep apnea and/or cardiovascular risk.","Demographic Categories of Interest

How do data from the All of Us database compare against known data sources that are considered to be representative of the general population and have been traditionally used in vision health surveillance activities (such as NHANES, NHIS, etc.)? How does All of Us compare to existing big-data sources such as IQVIA?
There is increasing interest in understanding how social factors impact health and vision outcomes. Social determinants of health are important considerations for disease management and prognosis, and our representative use case (diabetes and diabetic retinopathy) has huge implications for our health system as  the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment among working-age adults in the United States. By answering the above questions, we can determine whether the All of Us database is representative and may be broadly generalizable for future studies.","Project Purpose(s)

o	Examine demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity) of cohorts across data sources
-	Identify areas of similarity/alignment vs. differences","Anticipated Findings
If we are able to demonstrate that the All of Us database is representative and aligns with existing nationwide data sources, then findings regarding links between social determinants and vision health outcomes using All of Us would be felt to be more broadly generalizable. On the other hand, if there are major discrepancies between All of Us and previously established data sources, this would be important information for the vision research community to be aware of, and this could even inform future efforts to make the database more representative.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients with diabetes and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate an increase risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, longer hospital stay, and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients who have experienced hypoglycemia during inpatient admissions versus those who have not. In those without diabetes, inpatient hypoglycemia may still occur. Studies demonstrate that even in patients without diabetes, hypoglycemia results in poor clinical outcomes as related to mortality and cognitive function. There is no standard protocol for blood glucose monitoring inpatient for patients without diabetes. A standardized protocol could more closely trend blood glucose values among hospitalized non-diabetic patients who have an elevated risk of hypoglycemia in order to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia and its related complications.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (hypoglycemia)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
A retrospective review of patients will be conducted who have experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) during inpatient hospitalization and potential risk factors which may have contributed to such episode will be identified. Examples include end stage liver disease, renal disease, cardiac disease, protein-calorie malnutrition. Following, use these risk factors in a multivariate analysis to create a scoring system which assigns specific point values to each risk factor in order to predict risk of hypoglycemia during admission.","Anticipated Findings
The findings should create a model of risk factors for hypoglycemia among hospitalized non-diabetics. Using this risk model, other researchers may be able to expand the findings to create prospective studies that aim to reduce the risk of developing hypoglycemia groups with these risk factors.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Age-associated neurodegenerative diseases (A2ND) contribute to the second leading cause of death worldwide and account for the majority of life-years lost to disability. As the global population ages, the prevalence and societal impact of A2ND will become ever greater with annual costs in the US expected to exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2050. The management and treatment of A2ND risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, might delay or prevent A2ND onset. To this point, an untreated risk factor generates a cascade that with time increases in complexity and ultimately results in A2ND. Our aim is to select risk factor profiles that are targetable with a drug class and assess if a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics can disrupt the risk cascade modifying A2ND onset.  We aim to include in our analyses demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, genotype, disease stage, socioeconomic status) to stratify efficacy of each therapeutic for AD prevention in a given population.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (neurodegenerative disease)","Scientific Approaches
Our first analysis will examine most common A2ND diagnosis incidence rates in subjects with long-term use of a drug targeting a specific risk factor in comparison to subjects with no drug use.  We will focus, first on preventative drugs within classes such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogen modulating therapeutics, psychiatric drugs and therapeutics targeting the inflammatory and metabolic system. Factors such as race, age, gender, genotype (e.g. APOE for Alzhimer's Disease (AD))  and other co-morbidities will be used to determine populations of subjects in which this preventative effect is most pronounced. Our second analysis will evaluate possible therapeutic effects on A2ND diagnosis. For this, cognitive measures in subjects with long-term use of a therapeutic will be compared to those in subjects with no known use while accounting for variability in age, gender and race. The drug effect on cognitive scores will be examined in sub-populations defined by their genotype.","Anticipated Findings
Previous work from our group has shown benefits of treating AD risk factors with commonly used therapeutics (statins, estrogen replacement, selective estrogen receptor modulators, etc) to reduce AD onset. Of clinical importance, there may be selective benefits for  specific genotype patients with and the ability to advance a precision prevention approach for AD. Going forward, key issues to be explored are sex differences in response to therapy, genotypes and phenotypes most appropriate for a given therapy and which specific therapies have greatest preventative efficacy in the context of other variables such as sex, ApoE genotype, and other comorbidities. Results of our pilot analyses and the work proposed here will contribute to a growing body of evidence indicative of therapeutic benefit of AD risk factor treatment in a responder subset and thus have the potential to impact risk and course of Alzheimer's disease. We will extend our analysis to other neurodegenerative disease.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asian Americans recorded the fastest growth rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the US between 2019 and 2020. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension occur at high rates within the Asian American community but are masked by high socioeconomic status, education, and health insurance.  Undoubtedly, with this rapid growth, pre-existing health disparities in the Asian-American community will become magnified. Currently, Asian Americans are more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) despite having a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to other racial/ethnic groups.
Researchers have been unable to identify health trends within Asian American subgroups. In this study, we aim to examine the prevalence of T2D among the Asian American cohort of the All of Us Research Program, which may differ within each ethnic subgroup. How do the rates of T2D, as diagnosed by hemoglobin A1C, differ among Asian American racial subgroups?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a retrospective observational study with the All of Us cohort data. We plan to access the EHR of participants within Asian American subgroups. Within the EHR’s, T2D will be defined as diagnosed by a physician or measured by HA1C levels. We plan to use SPSS or R to run the statistical analysis. We plan to use a one-way ANOVA to investigate if our single independent variable, the racial subgroup, will have an effect on the dependent variable, T2D.","Anticipated Findings
The goal is to delineate health trends and disaggregate Asian American subgroups. We anticipate identifying health trends regarding the prevalence of T2D within Asian American subgroups. By identifying these trends, we hope to raise awareness of the prevalence of T2D within Asian American communities. There is currently a deficit in biomedical research regarding Asian Americans. This is especially concerning, as Asian Americans are on pace to be one of the fastest-growing racial groups in America. By identifying trends within the cohort, the results can be used to identify which groups are most susceptible to T2D, which will allow the development of better prevention strategies and optimal treatment.","Demographic Categories of Interest

According to the CDC, 90% of the nation's $3.5 trillion annual health care expenditures is spent on treating chronic and mental health conditions. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) provided by Registered Dietitians has been shown to be an effective and cost-effective component of treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, in small clinical studies and medical practices in hospitals. Thus, MNT could be an additional powerful medical treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. However, there is no known large-scale research that examines the effectiveness of MNT in the diseases. By leveraging the national-level data from All of Us, we hope to determine if MNT could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. If possible, we would also like to determine if specific nutrition interventions provided in MNT produce significantly better health outcomes compared to other nutrition interventions provided in MNT.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Diseases)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a prospective cohort study for individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndromes. Individuals with those diseases who have completed at least 1 MNT or no MNT will be included in the cohort. MNT is being provided by Registered Dietitians in hospitals and clinics, so data about MNT is available from the EHR. By following those individuals in the cohort over time, we will have their short-, middle-, and long-term health outcomes of the diseases. By comparing the health outcomes between individuals who completed MNT and individuals who did not, after adjusting potential confounders, we will determine if could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. Additionally, we will attempt to categorize different MNTs based on their specific nutrition interventions and determine if specific MNTs are more effective.","Anticipated Findings
The primary outcome of the study is the overall effectiveness of MNT on cardiometabolic diseases. The secondary outcome of the study is the effectiveness of specific MNTs on cardiometabolic diseases. Our finding might provide evidence that MNT is an effective treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, in addition to medications and medical surgeries. MNT provided by Registered Dietitians could be an essential part of a health care team that is responsible for treating cardiometabolic diseases, positively impacting patients' weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose control.  Additionally, since MNT is cost-effective, it could help save health care expenditures, which is beneficial to alleviate the financial burden of the diseases. Lastly, because MNT is an individualized nutrition treatment, our findings could contribute to the understanding of the effect of precision nutrition on human health, as one-size-fits-all nutritional approaches have not been very effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Exercise has been shown to produce beneficial effects in many aspects of this very complex disease as well as in the co-morbidities frequently occurring with HFpEF (e.g. atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, etc.).  More research is needed to analyze how different clinical phenotypes of HFpEF respond to exercise training and whether exercise training is a viable strategy for the treatment and management of HFpEF.","Project Purpose(s)

Early identification of patients with undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) or those at an increased risk of developing the disease is an important public health challenge. We aim to develop a predictive model for disease transitions in T2D. This will help us gain a more accurate understanding of the combination of factors that cause the disease, allowing us to more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients. Our research aims to 1) better understand T2D disease transition and progression, 2) more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients, 3) better understand the risk factors that lead to the development of the disease and their interactions, 4) identify currently unknown risk factors, 5) gain a better understanding of which types of interventions have the greatest chance of success for impacting disease transition, either by reducing the severity of the disease, delaying its onset, or preventing it altogether.","Project Purpose(s)

We aim to improve the accuracy of clinical risk factors used for modeling T2D  to inform population health interventions, individual patient care, and research discovery by integrating machine learning and cohort analyses using All of Us datasets. By investigating risk factors of T2D we have the potential to improve disease detection/diagnosis and gain important insights into the etiology and sequelae of this complex disease.","Anticipated Findings
The results from our study could help patients in several ways. First, a predictive model might help to more accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients and identify the most effective ways to prevent the condition from developing or worsening. Second, identifying relevant risk factors (both known and unknown), as well as their interactions, may help to deliver patient interventions earlier to reduce disease outcomes. This may also help doctors and patients target the factors that are most likely to reduce or eliminate disease transition, helping to provide the best clinical outcome for patients.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex common disease that disproportionately impacts minority ethnic and racial groups. Socioeconomic deprivation (SED) is widely considered to be a risk factor for T2D disparities. In 2021, the effect of genetic ancestry (GA) on such disparities was studied using data from the United Kingdom (UK) to reveal an interaction. The study found that both SED and non-European GA were significantly associated with the observed T2D disparities, with GA showing a stronger effect than SED in the overall population. GA and SED show significant interaction effects on T2D, with SED being a greater risk factor for T2D for individuals with South Asian and African ancestry, compared to those with European ancestry. This study underscored how the effects of environmental risk factors can differ among ancestry groups, suggesting the need for group-specific interventions. We intend to conduct a similar study using more diverse data from the United States' All of Us project.","Project Purpose(s)

In type 1 diabetes (T1D), insulin is not produced by the pancreas, leading to the inability to properly metabolize sugar. If caught early, T1D can be treated with regular insulin injections. As insulin shares properties with growth hormones, a side-effect of managing T1D with insulin injections may be increased growth.

We will analyze conditions that may be associated with esophageal achalasia. Specifically:
1. Is idiopathic achalasia associated with other medical conditions that lead to microvascular damage (e.g. type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis etc.)?
Esophageal achalasia is an idiopathic, rare disorder characterized by degeneration of neurons of the myenteric plexus of the esophagus. Gastroparesis, which functionally resembles achalasia and affects diabetic patients, is hypothesized to occur due to nerve ischemia from microvascular damage secondary to diabetes. Studies on achalasia have been largely limited due to the rarity of the condition, but understanding whether a relationship exists between achalasia and disorders that cause vascular damage could help inform guidelines on preventive care given how common some of these conditions are in the U.S. population (e.g. type II diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, autoimmune conditions).","Project Purpose(s)

I plan on reviewing the data set and performing a case-control study. Patients will be included in the study  if  they are ≥ 18  years of age and have esophageal achalasia.  Patients will be matched by age, race, and sex. Then they will be compared to patients without diagnosed esophageal achalasia and compared on their prevalence of type II diabetes, type I diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, malignancy, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematous, and IBD. I will also perform a subanalysis by race for the risks given the limited data on achalasia and hypothesized HLA predispositions. Means will be compared between cohorts using a Student’s t-test. Proportions will be compared using the chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression will be performed to further examine specific conditions and  the results will be expressed using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. I will consider a p value of <0.05 significant for all findings.","Anticipated Findings
It is anticipated that most, if not all of these conditions leading to microvascular damage, will be represented to a greater extent in the achalasia group compared to the control group. Regardless, any information gathered would be very helpful in leading to a greater understanding of esophageal achalasia, which is poorly understood. Information on associations by race would also be very valuable as little data exists on the topic given the rarity of the condition.

Aevus is engineering a ML -powered Prescription Guidance Platform - Aevus Precision Rx for Endocrinologists/PCPs  to tailor prescriptions for Type 2 diabetes patients. In doing so, Aevus intends to improve T2D  drug outcomes, reduce medication switching and lower treatment costs. There are 11 drug classes used to treat T2D with over 100 different medications for a doctor to choose from prior to prescribing a treatment plan to a patient. The doctor is thus faced with a problem of plenty - On average, it takes an Endocrinologist/PCP 18-24 months to arrive at a stable drug compound and dosage of that compound to treat a T2D patient. A portion of the astronomical health care spending also goes into treating Adverse Drug Reactions, which are frequent and drain the health system of $3.5 B annually. Precision Rx will act as a real-time point-of-care clinical decision support tool that will interface as a software between the physician and the EHR.","Project Purpose(s)

The goal of our modelling outcome is to generate a scale that will rank the 11 drug classes used to treat Type 2 Diabetes in decreasing order of potential toxicity to the patient. The above mentioned overarching ML model will comprise of several sub-ML models, the ensemble of which will produce an umbrella model that can rank all the drug classes. Each sub-model will tackle the question of 'Is drug class X suitable for unique patient XYZ or not?'. Precision Rx is intended to be a tool that can easily integrate into the existing clinical workflow of a physician with minimal change to their routine. There have been some advancements in the space of automated clinical decision support for Type 2 Diabetes in the past - tools like Epocrates have EHR integration capabilities that allow for physicians to make more accurate prescription decisions based purely off ADA guidelines.

We want conduct an exhaustive cost-effectiveness analysis on all antihypertensive drugs across a variety of outcomes to be able to suggest modified prescription guidelines. Hypertension affects 30-45% of adults in the United States (depending on the definition of hypertension used) representing a significant economic burden on both individuals and society. However, there are many guidelines spanning different countries, associations, and organizations which often recommend multiple drug classes even in the case of another existing condition (e.g. type 2 diabetes). We want to use real world evidence to conduct cost effectiveness analysis to improve the existing guidelines.","Project Purpose(s)

We plan to use the electronic health records (EHR) data as real world evidence to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis. Specifically, we will get the EHR of all individuals who have been diagnosed with hypertension and are first time users of antihypertensive monotherapies. We will then match the cohorts with propensity score matching and conduct cost-effectiveness analysis on all pairwise combinations of drugs with respect to a number of outcomes including: QALY and ICER.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that for most disease/secondary outcomes there is no major difference between different classes or active ingredients of antihypertensives especially for the short term outcome of 5 years. With our findings, we will be able to suggest changes to the existing hypertension prescription guidelines for different races, sexes, ages, preexisting diseases (e.g. chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.) which we hope will have a positive impact on healthcare.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Main goal: To develop an effective approach to identify unique genetic and clinical profiles for characterizing different skin conditions.
Aim 1: Catalog the molecular/biomedical information available on skin diseases and then investigate its potential for understanding the impact of diseases in terms of their environmental factors, comorbidities, drug prescriptions, mental health and mobility.
Aim 2: Identifying the unique genetic determinants of skin diseases and their prognosis by comparing the alleles for genetic markers in these patients with controls. Understanding how these unique determinants are shared with other human disorders.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (skin disease)","Scientific Approaches
Although epidemiological and genetic studies have been conducted to reveal distinct clinical and molecular features for different skin conditions (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, etc.), the identification of shared and unique disease components has been challenged by the lack of large population-based studies. Over the past five years, large biobanks are being established, which instead of focusing on a specific disease, invest vast effort to collect detailed clinical and molecular information from the general population. These population-level biobanks can significantly extend the application and translation of findings by providing resources to unravel the factors shaping the diversity of different disease conditions. The patients in the Biobank with a wide range of skin diseases and the diverse range of information provided will be useful for understanding the overall burden of cutaneous disorders.","Anticipated Findings

Genome-wide association studies of mental health conditions have identified variants that contribute to a small portion of the total disorder variance. While these data have been useful in identifying novel genetic associations, in large part these data have not been used predict risk of disease. Our hope is to leverage the All of Us data to estimate disease effect estimates for multiple mental health conditions in diverse populations. Specific questions include: (1) what are the most significant non-genetic and genetic factors in association with serious mental illnesses? (2) How can we combine both clinical risk factors and genomic risk scores to predict mental health conditions? We hypothesize that a risk model incorporating both non-genetic and genetic factors will have better power to explain and predict mental health conditions. This study will develop and evaluate end-to-end predictive models for mental health phenotype in diverse groups.  Phase-3 will focus on HLA region.","Project Purpose(s)

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
We will cover all eligible participants with different background in All of Us. First, self-reported surveys (e.g., lifestyle and medical history) and electronic health records (EHR) will be used to determine serious mental illness cases and their matched controls. Exposure variables will be assessed and harmonized across resources; and pre-processed for missing value and outliers. Second, disease risk factors will then be interrogated by regularized regression (non-genetic) and genome-wide association test (genetic). Third, clinical risk score and genomic risk score will be constructed by weighted sum of significant risk factors retained, and then combined by logistic regression and random forest. Fourth, a set of candidate risk models will be validated and then optimized in prospective sample, via C statistics and other diagnostic metrics. The whole framework will also be repeated in stratified samples so as to tune the parameters for specific groups (e.g., age, sex, and race).","Anticipated Findings
Findings from this project would identify novel genetic biomarkers and establish a predictive model to classify individuals at different risk for developing serious mental illness. We expect to find: (1) significant clinical/social factors and biomarkers that are associated with focused diseases; (2) polygenic risk scores tailored for overall population and different subgroups; (3) risk model comprised of non-genetic risk factors and polygenic risk scores. We also anticipate some risk factors may present different effect sizes across populations. There is a need to revise risk model in general population to increase its performance in specific group. However, those difference observed across populations may be caused by social determinants, instead of biology; and some of them may be not well covered in All of Us. We will mitigate the potential stigmatization risk of our models in future publications and presentations by providing more discussion on its benefit and limitation.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. What proportion of adults in the dataset identify as a sexual minority and autistic, and what is the prevalence of co-occurring mental health conditions among autistic sexual minority adults?
2. What associations exist between social determinants of health and the health and health care access of autistic sexual minority adults?
3. What associations exist between social determinants of health and the mental health and emotional wellbeing of autistic sexual minority adults?
RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Growing research suggests that a higher proportion of autistic people are sexual and gender minority (SGM) but little is known about their healthcare needs. Research suggests that autistic adults have worse health/mental health outcomes than their allistic peers and that SGM adults have worse health/mental health outcomes than their cisgender and heterosexual peers, but few studies have explored outcomes for autistic sexual minority adults specifically.","Project Purpose(s)

Injuries are not created equal; groups experience injuries at different rates. Aging US population yields increases in falls, but assaultive injuries shouldered by Black or African American patients, work related injuries shouldered by Hispanic/Latinx patients. Historic and ongoing systemic racism has led to modern segregation and inequities across the country that may drive injury disparities. Most injuries are preventable and present a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy. At the individual level injuries confer risk for poor mental and physical health, lower quality of life, increased financial and economic burden. Risk for poor mental health after injury may be impacted by various factors such as mechanism of injury and prior or current exposures to stress. Disproportionate exposure to injury can therefore differentially impact health and quality of life.","Project Purpose(s)

Research question: What is the relationship between chronic pain and hip and waist circumference? Can hip and waist circumference be used as predictors of chronic pain onset and burden? Are hip and waist circumferences accurate and reliable indicators of chronic pain?
Chronic pain is among the most common morbidities globally, afflicting 1.71 billion people globally with an estimated prevalence of 50.2 million adults in the US alone. Living with a chronic pain condition has been associated with a detrimental impact on a patient’s mental health, sleep habits, and physical state. Thus, understanding potential risk factors can help reduce the prevalence of chronic pain and help create preventative measures.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (Our chronic pain research aims to identify and investigate measures that can prevent or minimize the occurrence of chronic pain conditions, diseases, or adverse events. We aim to understand the risk factors of hip and waist circumference, and any underlying mechanisms, and help aid the creation of effective strategies to prevent the onset or progression of chronic pain. Additionally, we aim to educate others on the correlation between chronic pain and hip and waist circumference. )","Scientific Approaches
Our approach to the study will require examining the various demographic factors related to pain and hip/waist circumference. We intend to include subjects 18 years or older in this study, however, we have no exclusion criteria for other demographics for this study. Other variables documented will include numerical rating scale numerical rating scale (NRS) scores, specific diagnoses made in relation to pain, medications taken, and pain severity. By noting these factors, we hope to use correlation analysis to determine the relationship between chronic pain and hip/waist circumference.","Anticipated Findings
Our study is aiming to explore the correlation between hip/waist circumference to chronic pain. We anticipate that our data collection will show these measurements to serve as a more precise and accurate link to chronic pain compared to the current standard, which is BMI. By improving the markers of chronic pain, we believe that we can further manage individuals by creating a more transparent depiction of individuals with pain. By minimizing false positives and negatives in screening for pain, we hope to effectively portray the chronic pain population. Creating a stronger correlation to chronic pain will create a more concrete understanding of individuals with pain, reducing any incorrect classifications made with BMI. By understanding the population to a greater degree, it will become more feasible to analyze and assess for the best ways to manage pain.","Demographic Categories of Interest

**Scientific Question**
How do sociodemographic factors (such as gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status), depression, anxiety, and alcohol or other drug use differ between individuals who initiate cannabis use at age 21 compared to those who initiate at the more typical age of 14-16?
**Importance**
This study is primarily concerned with the etiology of drug use disorders: The current literature on cannabis and associated mental health, social, and economic problems in the United States is almost entirely based on a prior legal environment in which cannabis was illegal everywhere. Now that there is a patchwork of different legal conditions, we can finally gain some insight into how much of these associated problems are due to the use of cannabis itself, vs the need to operate within an illegal market with all of the associated social ties and associations that develop as a result. The results of the study will have important implications for cannabis policy in the US.","Project Purpose(s)

1: Are rates of lifetime cigarette use significantly different in those with mental health disorders than in the general population.
2: Which disorders show the highest rates of lifetime cigarette use.
3. Are rates of lifetime e-cigarette use significantly different in those with mental health disorders than in the general population.
4.Which disorders show the highest rates of lifetime e-cigarette use.
5. How do the mental health disorders differ from the general population in quit rates for cigarette use?
6. How do the mental health disorders differ from the general population in quit rates for e-cigarette use?
7. What is the nature of the overlap between cigarette use and e-cigarette use within various mental health disorders?","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The purpose of these analyses are to use the All of Us dataset to examine the relationship between cigarette use, electronic cigarette use and various mental health disorders including major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and PTSD. We will be looking at prevalence of life time cigarette and e-cigarette use in those with various mental health disorders. We will also compare each disorder with a non-MH disorder control group using  logistic regression in both unadjusted and adjusted models. Adjustments will include, but not be limited to, age and gender.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that certain mental health disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder) will have significantly higher lifetime cigarette use rates than a non-MH population. We are less certain of the findings on e-cigarette use as this has been much less much less explored in large samples such as All of Us.

Due to the increase in mental health disorders throughout the past few decades, I'm interested in exploring how various health outcomes may correlate with mental health diagnoses in pediatric years. I hypothesize that participants with mental health diagnoses such as depression and anxiety in pediatrics may have worse health outcomes when compared to their peers due to mental health's impact on physical health. The anticipated findings could hopefully shed light on the need for more pediatric mental health services to prevent adult non-communicable diseases down the road.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
The dataset would be from participants with identified medical records before the age of 18. The cohort then would be divided into two groups of: those who had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and those who do not. With each group, we will then look at the risk ratio of common NCD such as hypertension, Type II DM, and hyperlipidemia. Looking at the geographic data of the participants will help our team understand the access to care that those participants may have had.","Anticipated Findings
Early diagnosis of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety will lead to worse health outcomes due to the multifaceted effects of mental health disorders, impacting other domains of life such as livelihood and relationship building.

The AoU program integrated self-reported survey data (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and sex assigned at birth) with EHR data (including gender identity disorder [GID]-related ICD code and medication information), physical measurements and biospecimens to create a data repository. This allows us to explore SOGI disparities in mental health outcomes using diverse and large volunteer cohorts from different sources. Despite existing computable phenotype algorithms to detect HIV cases from AoU, there is a lack of standardization regarding detecting SGMs in the AoU platform for SOGI-related analyses.

We will define suspected gender minorties using a combination of EHR and survey data. In the EHR data, we used transgender/gender nonbinary diagnosis code (ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes) in the “condition occurrence” table and gender affirming medications in the “drug exposure” table, and transgender related surgery in ""procedure"" table.  In addition to EHR, we identified gender minorities using responses to two survey questions, including: (1) “What was your biological sex assigned at birth?” (responses include female and male); and (2) “What terms best express how you describe your gender identity?” (Responses include woman, man, non-binary, transgender, and additional options). Participants whose responses to gender identity were not “woman”/“man” or there were incongruences in their sex assigned at birth and gender identity were considered as “gender minority.”","Anticipated Findings
Through exploring the phenotyping algorithm of gender identity disorder (GID) and the intersection effects of race, gender identity, and sexual orientation on their mental health.

Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The cohort we will be utilizing will be participants 18 and older, adults, from a variety of backgrounds. Within our cohort we will have two subgroups. One group containing individuals with hypertension and one without hypertension.
We will most likely be using the following surveys from the Research All of Us Workbench: The Basics; Lifestyle; Overall Health; Social Determinants of Healt; and Emotional Health and Wellbeing.
Using RStudio, we will first code to stratify by gender, race, ethnicity, and economic status. We will then use code to analyze anxiety disorders and depressive episodes. Then, patient provider relationship, chronic stress, and factors of discrimination. Second, we are going to code for characteristics and connections regarding adherence. This may include different types of treatment plans, mental health, and efficacy of treatment plans.","Anticipated Findings
Using our findings from an 18 source literature review, we anticipate:
Higher access to health care, rates of health literacy, and income will increase hypertension treatment efficacy and decrease mental health affects.

Globally, Black and U.S. Latina/o/x populations suffer disproportionately from  psychiatric disorders, such as psychotic disorders, compared to White Americans regardless of socioeconomic status. This is largely due to systemic racism, which has been deemed a fundamental cause of health care inequities. Yet few empirical studies have directly investigated the social determinants of psychiatric disorders, while also examining the impact of these determinants on the human genome (epigenetics). Theoretical emphasis has highlighted the importance of studying the confluence of biological and social factors on psychosis. The aim of this study is to initiate an interdisciplinary microbiome study integrating bioinformatics and social determinants of mental health using data from the recent NIH-sponsored All of Us Research Program, while building a sustain able mentored student research project","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health

Ancestry","Scientific Approaches
The main research objective is to identify the microbiome signature associated with psychosis and determine if psychosis-associated microbiota vary by social determinants of health such as neighborhood quality, deprivation, and cohesion. We will use the All of Us database to elucidate exposure to racial discrimination in Black and Latinx individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders and those not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders, then use the AnVIL platform to compare microbiotic genetic profiles in these populations.  Interaction terms in the regression models between genomic data and social determinant and discrimination measure scores will be created to determine the degree to which joint combinations predict probability of psychotic disorders. All models will covary key demographic factors such as sex, gender, and age.","Anticipated Findings
The research findings will contribute to a body of knowledge that can improve disease prevention strategies and health care treatment in two communities (Black and Latina/o/x) that have been historically medically underserved. It will represent the first time, to our knowledge, that this type of innovative interdisciplinary research connecting genomic research with social determinants of health focused specifically on Black and Latinx health has occurred. The research collaboration between faculty and students at CCNY and Guttman Community College also marks a novel interdisciplinary research model, with both four-year and two-year undergraduate students contributing equally to a research project that has the potential to shape how the scientific community understands mental health disorders.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We propose to explore the issue of phenotypically heterogenous groupings in bipolar disorder within the AURP cohort by use of clinical and genetic measures. Relevant clinical variables include: medication history (e.g., use of lithium or other mood stabilizers), treatment history (e.g., contact with mental health professionals), and comorbidity (e.g., suicidal behavior, alcohol use disorder). Genetically, relevant variables can be derived from summary statistics produced by GWAS of BD and related disorders. In general, we expect that participants who report a history of BD supported by typical clinical history will carry an increased burden of BD risk alleles compared to participants who report BD without a supporting clinical history. Existing GWAS also provide excellent benchmarks for heritability estimated from genetic relationships (“SNP heritability”). Thus this study aims to identify clinical and genetic features that may define distinct subsets of individuals who report BD.","Project Purpose(s)

Since AURP comprises a rich diversity of study participants, interaction effects with regard to demographic variables will also be considered.","Anticipated Findings
Results from this study will provide novel insight into genotype-phenotype relationships across the broad spectrum of BD. Unlike case-control studies, which are biased toward more severe, treatment-recieving cases, diverse, population-based cohorts like AURP, provide a more representative sample that is expected to provide a new perspective on the genetic architecture of BD and related disorders.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My questions are:
What are the specific genetic markers influencing SSRI responsiveness?
How can decision tree ensemble models be effectively utilized to measure the importance of input features in the context of SSRI responsiveness?
What is the impact of whole-genome sequencing information in uncovering genetic determinants of SSRI response compared to limited subset analyses?
How can the identified genetic determinants be translated into personalized medication recommendations for individuals with affective disorders?
The relevance of these questions to science and public health lies in the potential to enhance the understanding of individual variability in SSRI responses, leading to more targeted and effective treatment strategies for individuals with affective disorders. The research aims to contribute valuable insights into the genetic basis of SSRI responsiveness, offering a pathway towards more personalized approaches to medication in mental health treatment.","Project Purpose(s)

Here are my approaches:
1. Data Acquisition: From the All of Us database, extract data on patients with affective disorders who've been exposed to SSRI medications. Focus on those with whole-genome sequencing information.
2. Model Implementation: Use decision tree ensemble models, which can measure the importance of input features. While these models traditionally rank the significance of SNP/Indel variants, our approach aims to pinpoint essential genomic locations
influencing SSRI efficacy.
3. Feature Importance Analysis: Analyze the trained model to reveal crucial genetic determinants of SSRI response. This step will help identify genetic markers with the most influence on medication responsiveness.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings are:
Identification of Specific Genetic Markers, Insights into Genomic Locations, Validation of Decision Tree Ensemble Models, Comparison with Limited Subset Analyses, Potential for Personalized Medication Recommendations.
While SSRIs are common treatments for affective disorders, patient responses vary significantly. Current methods for recommending SSRIs based on genomic information are limited, analyzing only a subset of genes.

How do SDOH influence individuals' mental well-being in the context of a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic?
Our primary objective is to accurately pinpoint individuals who are most susceptible to experiencing mental health issues based on specific social determinants of health. These determinants include but are not limited to, the safety of the neighborhood they live in, social support that they receive from their peers, discrimination that they may be subjected to, loneliness, and food insecurity. By identifying these factors, we can proactively anticipate and provide support to individuals at the highest risk of experiencing mental health challenges, especially during critical periods of vulnerability, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project seeks to uplift and empower vulnerable communities, acknowledging the importance of a collective and compassionate response to mental health challenges in the face of adversity.","Project Purpose(s)

Our approach involves a multi-step process to investigate how social determinants of health (SDoH) contribute to the worsening of mental health during a public health crisis. First, we will conduct a detailed descriptive data analysis to better understand the information and its characteristics. This will involve examining various factors that are available for participants, such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and SDoH. After completing the descriptive analysis, we will implement linear mixed models to identify individuals at high risk of poor mental health outcomes overall and over time during the pandemic. Specifically, we will explore the relationship between these waves, SDoH, and mental health outcomes. This will allow us to better understand the impact of the pandemic on mental health and identify factors that may be contributing or aggravating to mental health decline.","Anticipated Findings
Our hypothesis is that social determinants of health (SDoH) have a significant impact on mental health, and that the effect is not limited to a single SDoH factor. Instead, we expect to see that a combination of these factors can contribute to the decline of participants' mental health. These factors may include socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, education, employment, housing, and social support. By analyzing the data collected, we hope to gain a better understanding of how multiple SDoH factors interact and affect mental health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We intend to assess the differences in care for patients aged 18 and over who were diagnosed with mental health/substance use disorders across different genders. This question is important because oftentimes discrimination against those with mental illness or substance use in healthcare settings can result in delayed diagnosis, referral to treatment, and recovery for mental and substance use problems, as well as other health conditions. The All of Us survey allows us to estimate the occurrence of and correlates of perceiving frequent discrimination in healthcare settings from a large national sample of patients.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Data from a subsample of participants in the All of Us study who completed the Social Determinants of Health and the Personal and Family Health History surveys were analyzed. Perceived discrimination in healthcare settings was assessed by asking participants “How often do any of these happen to you when you go to a doctor’s office or other health care provider?” Multivariable logistic regression models with a sex*history of mental health interaction term were conducted to estimate average marginal effects of perceiving frequent discrimination across categories of biological sex at birth and prior mental health history. Wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted to estimate sex differences in marginal effects for those with and without a history of a mental health or substance use disorder and differences in the sex gap for those with a with and without a history of a mental health or substance use disorder. Analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.2 Patched on Jupyter notebook.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to find differences in the treatment of mental health/substance use disorders depending on the gender of the patient. These findings are intended to highlight the unconscious and conscious bias that exists in the treatment of mental health/substance use disorders among people of different genders. Hopefully, the results of the study will demonstrate the need for new approaches to mental healthcare to improve treatment and care for all patients and ensure that they all receive quality care, regardless of their gender. Identifying population groups that face a higher risk of discrimination within healthcare settings, is pivotal for tailoring education programs aimed at healthcare professionals. This program can equip them with the knowledge and sensitivity needed to interact effectively with diverse patient populations.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Our study examines the association between covid-19 with new onset anxiety and depression. From this study, we are determining if viral infections such as covid-19 can be a contributor to the diagnosis of mental health conditions anxiety or depression.","Project Purpose(s)
Educational","Scientific Approaches
This review aims to determine if there are statistically significant rates of new-onset anxiety and depression diagnoses after COVID-19 infection among All of Us Research Program participants. Our project uses EHR-derived diagnoses of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression from the conditions domain as well as COVID-19 diagnoses from the labs and measurements domain. Our analysis also incorporates demographic and socioeconomic variables from participant-provided survey data. Data cleaning was performed in Python, and logistic regression was performed in R to evaluate the association between COVID-19 infection and these mental health conditions.","Anticipated Findings
Anxiety and depression are known comorbidities, however their relationship with viral infections including COVID-19 is not fully clear. It is common for patients to experience anxiety or depression when diagnosed with COVID-19, however even after full recovery, patients can remain anxious or depressed. This may be due to any number of factors, including long isolation after recovery. Depression is implicated in immune system suppression, and can complicate recovery from viral infections including COVID-19. Depression has also been identified as a possible neuropsychiatric consequence of COVID-19. However, the relationship between COVID-19 infection and its direct link with anxiety and depression is still being studied. COVID-19 survivors are at elevated risk for suicide due to the presence of depression after recovery.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Sexual minority (SM) women are an understudied population, although they face unique stressors including stigma, discrimination, and violence. Compared to straight women, SM women experience increased risks for depression, mental distress, heart disease, and tension or worry. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, people worldwide are facing a confluence of factors that contribute to mental health challenges, including risk of disease and death from COVID-19, loss of loved ones, decreased social contact, and employment loss. Science would benefit from studying how SM women are faring in this context and some protective factors that may be helpful.
This study's research questions are:
1. How is the overall mental health of SM women related to COVID-specific stressors (stress from social distancing and COVID-specific thought patterns and anxieties)?
2. Which social factors and coping behaviors act as protective factors for SM women’s mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Project Purpose(s)

This project will involve secondary data analysis of data from the NIH’s All of US study, including data collected through general project surveys as well as the COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) surveys. Data analysis will be conducted using R and well-vetted open access R packages.
We will use analytic techniques including profile analysis and OLS multiple linear regression.
Throughout the project, we will consult with community members (sexual minority women) on research questions, project design, framing of implications, and dissemination of findings.","Anticipated Findings
This research is anticipated to allow for improved understanding of the overall stress and mental health of SM women during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, this study is anticipated to help document whether specific coping behaviors, sense of life purpose, and social support can make a difference for the mental health of SM women during the pandemic, which can inform the work of community organizations and health providers who work to support SM women’s mental health.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), encompassing conditions like stroke and heart attack, remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. While traditional risk factors such as diet, exercise, and genetics are well-documented, the potential impact of novel environmental exposures, particularly lithium and pesticides, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge presents an urgent need for comprehensive research to understand these relationships better.
This research is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses a relatively unexplored area of environmental health. Understanding the role of lithium, commonly found in water supplies and used in various industries, and pesticides, widely used in agriculture, in the development of heart attacks and strokes could be significant in reducing the global burden of these diseases. Furthermore, this study could inform policy makers, guiding regulations on environmental exposures and public health advisories.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (cerebrovascular disease)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The study will employ an epidemiological approach, analyzing data from diverse populations to establish correlations between CVD incidence and levels of lithium and pesticide exposure. This will involve detailed environmental assessments, comprehensive medical histories, and possibly biomarker analyses to accurately quantify exposure levels. Advanced statistical methods will be used to control for confounding variables, ensuring the validity of the findings.","Anticipated Findings
The anticipated findings from this study could range from establishing a clear correlation between these novel exposures and increased CVD risk, to identifying no significant relationship. In cases where a positive association is found, the results could pave the way for further research into mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic interventions, and targeted public health strategies. Even in the absence of a significant association, the findings would be valuable in ruling out these exposures as major risk factors, refining the focus for future CVD research.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) will be used to compare the All of Us genetic data by creating polygenic risk scores (PRS) that can be used to predict psychiatric disorders within the All of Us dataset. The PRSs will be based on the larger GWAS studies by sampling and clustering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS), and creating a specific PRS based on the psychiatric disorder of interest through the All of Us data. Regressions will be run on these PRSs and will be used to predict psychiatric disorders based on the All of Us participants' available psychiatric data. Covariates like family history, age, and sex of participants will be accounted for. Moderation analysis will examine any interaction effects between genetic risk and environmental factors, such as social support.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate to find that each of the disorder specific polygenic risk scores will significantly predict higher rates of diagnosed psychiatric disorders. We predict that each of the PRSs will be predicative for each of the psychiatric disorders in the study. We predict that there will be a buffering effect when higher social support is present. Due to the quantity and quality of the All of Us data, these findings would expand our scientific knowledge on the etiology of psychiatric disorders, how they interact with the environment, and the predictive validity of polygenic risk scores.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. What are the key risk factors associated with postpartum depression (PPD) in racial minorities such as previous psychiatric history, social support, and socioeconomic status?
Understanding specific risk factors for postpartum depression that racial minorities experience is crucial for the development of culturally competent care and resources that can target unique inequalities or factors that may lead to poor maternal mental health outcomes.
2. Can predictive models be developed based on the identified risk factors to effectively identify women of racial minority at higher risk of postpartum depression?
Developing predictive models can enhance the understanding of risk factors that women of racial minority may experience and place them at an elevated risk of postpartum depression. This has significant implications for public health as it enables targeted interventions and support resources for individuals with possible unique risk factors.","Project Purpose(s)
Other Purpose (The data will be used by a non-profit entity for research publication. The purpose is to publish a manuscript on a poorly researched topic on racial minorities to better understand socioeconomic risk factors for postpartum depression.)","Scientific Approaches
The study will use quantitative methods. Firstly, a comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify existing knowledge on risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD). Quantitative analysis will involve the utilization of datasets, encompassing racial minority demographic information, mental health, and clinical variables related to women's health. Statistical methods, such as logistic regression, will be applied to assess the significance of identified risk factors and their interactions in PPD development. Additionally, machine learning algorithms will be employed to develop predictive models. Data analysis will be facilitated through statistical software and programming languages like R or Python. The interdisciplinary nature of this study aims to provide a holistic understanding of PPD, facilitating the development of targeted interventions and predictive models to identify and support women at higher risk.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings from the study include the identification of specific risk factors in women of racial minority associated with postpartum depression (PPD) and an understanding of how these factors interact in its development. The development of predictive models is expected to enhance the accuracy of identifying women at higher risk. Some risk factors that are anticipated to place women of racial minority at increased risk for PPD are lack of social support, lack of access to mental health services, and socioeconomic stressors. The study aims to contribute significantly to the scientific knowledge in the field by pinpointing specific risk factors for women of a racial minority. The development of predictive models enables the potential identification of high-risk individuals with the purpose of early support to reduce the risk of developing PPD.

Strabismus describes misalignment of the eyes and affects about 4% of the U.S. population. Strabismus in children and adults can be caused by a variety of conditions, such as neuromuscular disorders, trauma, and stroke. Regardless of cause, strabismus can reduce quality of life through effects like amblyopia, impaired vision, fatigue, and reduced self-esteem. Through the All of Us database, we plan to explore how a diagnosis of strabismus correlates with mental health clinical measures (such as diagnoses of depression of anxiety). We also intend to more broadly investigate the population characteristics of individuals with amblyopia for any reason, not just strabismus.","Project Purpose(s)

For this analysis, we plan to control for factors like age, gender, race, employment/income, substance use, personality disorders, and disability. The secondary analysis aim is to see how socioeconomic and demographic variables may act as predictors for a strabismus diagnosis. Finally, we will examine the demographic data of individuals with amblyopia of any cause. Our methods would include multivariable logistic regression to identify associated variables. All analyses will be conducted in the secure All of Us workspace.","Anticipated Findings
While strabismus is linked to reductions in quality of life, this association has not been well explored within the All of Us database yet. The All of Us database has the advantages of a more representative/diverse participant cohort, and the comprehensive data on diagnoses, social determinants, and questionnaire results will allow us to better characterize the relationship between strabismus and mental health measures while controlling for confounders. We expect to see higher levels of depression and anxiety in individuals with a strabismus diagnosis, even after controlling for confounding variables. Additionally, we expect that socioeconomic status and demographic variables will be associated with a strabismus diagnosis. The demographic analysis of those with amblyopia will be more of a descriptive study, with potential for further investigation into social determinants of health based on results.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Compared to individuals who don't exhibit good physical health, mental health, and psychological stability before surgery, do those who possess these robust health characteristics demonstrate better recovery speed and quality in their postoperative recovery process?
Its potential impact on improving surgical outcomes. If the study finds a positive correlation between physical health, mental health, and psychological stability and the quality and speed of postoperative recovery, this will provide crucial guidance for patient assessment and preparation before surgery. Such findings would underscore the importance of enhancing overall health level before surgery. This could not only increase the success rate of surgeries and reduce postoperative complications and hospitalization duration but might also improve patient quality of life and satisfaction on a broader scale. Furthermore, it could positively affect resource allocation and cost management within the healthcare system.","Project Purpose(s)

Introduction:
Mental health is a critical area of study, particularly in light of the ongoing global mental health crisis. Traditional measures of mental health often encompass conditions such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis. However, the subjective nature of mental health data collection and the presence of ambiguous or missing data present unique challenges for researchers utilizing electronic health records (EHRs). This proposal seeks to investigate the ""All of Us"" Research Workbench to determine how it handles missing and ambiguous data, particularly in relation to mental health indicators.
Objectives
1. To identify relevant mental health indicators within the ""All of Us"" Research Workbench.
2. To evaluate the transparency of data cleaning practices and the use of data proxies within the platform.
3. To assess the likelihood of data bias in specific datasets related to mental health.","Project Purpose(s)

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of individuals worldwide. The social isolation, financial hardships, healthcare crisis and overall uncertainty about the future has increased the probability of anxiety and depression. These trends are highly visible in Puerto Rico, where the usage of mental hotlines have doubled during the pandemic. However, a preliminary analysis of assessments and surveys by the Montalvo-Ortiz lab have suggested a high degree of resilience to depression in the Puerto Rican population (N=200). In this project I will expand on this proposal by comparing responses from the Montalvo-Ortiz questionnaires with responses from individuals within the United States to identify any differences in healthcare outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled for across differing sociodemographic factors.","Project Purpose(s)

The Montalvo-Ortiz and All of Us questionnaires include sociodemographic information pertaining to the participant’s gender, age, ethnic group, financial situation, educational background and region of origin. Moreso, they include information about health including diagnoses, stress levels, depression, suicidality, mental health treatment history, sleep quality, smoking use, alcohol use, post-traumatic stress, and self-reported resilience. The datasets will be stratified across the differing sociodemographic statuses using R, to compare the different health outcomes after the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis is integral in understanding whether there may be a genetic underpinning that provides certain groups with a higher capacity to endure adversity.","Anticipated Findings

Our study leverages machine learning (ML) to investigate SDOH's associations with diseases while focusing on creating impactful data visualizations. We'll integrate electronic health records and SDOH data, employing ML algorithms like decision trees and neural networks for prediction. Cross-validation ensures model reliability, and ethical data handling is a priority. We will emphasize the use of data visualizations, including geographic mapping, to communicate results effectively. Collaboration with experts and peer validation ensures robustness. Feature engineering and interpretability techniques enhance model understanding. This approach aims to provide actionable insights for public health research and policy development, with a strong emphasis on visually conveying complex findings.","Anticipated Findings
Anticipated findings from our study include the identification of key Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) factors strongly associated with common diseases, revealing geospatial patterns in disease prevalence and SDOH disparities. Our ML-based predictive models are expected to accurately forecast disease trends and disparities, while insights into health equity and the effectiveness of health literacy programs will empower informed decisions.
These findings will significantly contribute to the scientific knowledge in the field by deepening our understanding of how SDOH influence common diseases, enabling targeted interventions, pinpointing regions needing specific attention, revolutionizing healthcare with predictive models, promoting health equity, and guiding evidence-based policies.

Our scientific question is about the health disparity in alcohol use disorder (AUD), substance use disorder (SUD), and mental health, as well as the impact of the COVID pandemic on such health disparity. The COVID pandemic has been bringing financial, social, and psychological burdens, which are known risk factors for SUD and mental problems. Populations from minority groups, being socioeconomically disadvantaged, of younger ages, or with limited access to corresponding health care are at particularly higher risk of developing SUD or mental problems. Adolescents and young adults are also at higher risk. The understanding of how social determinants of health (SDoHs) are associated with the risk of new SUD and mental health problems will help better support the high-risk populations during and after the COVID pandemic.","Project Purpose(s)

Aim 1) Explore risk factors for early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC, age <50 at diagnosis)
The incidence of EOCRC has doubled in the last two decades, and although screening is effective, this is reserved for their older counterparts. Understanding risk factors may lead to future targeted interventions and tailored screening recommendations.
Aim 2) Explore interactions between age and sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health and disease-related outcomes
EOCRC presents unique financial and social challenges compared to LOCRC. Financially, younger patients often face greater economic burdens due to potential loss of income during their prime working years. Socially and psychologically, disruptions in key life milestones such as career development, marriage, and parenthood can lead to issues like depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Conversely, these may affect the patient's ability to acquire treatment and affect outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

Existing research often lacks specificity in addressing the unique experiences of young African-American women, neglecting the cultural and societal contexts that shape their mental health. By bridging this gap, the research aims to provide valuable insights that can inform tailored interventions and support systems to enhance the mental well-being of young African-American women. We hypothesize that there is a significant association between specific sociocultural factors and the prevalence and severity of depression among young African-American women. Through a comprehensive examination of factors such as racial identity, gender roles, socioeconomic status, and community dynamics, we anticipate identifying distinct patterns that contribute to the manifestation and persistence of depressive symptoms in this demographic.","Project Purpose(s)

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. We might be able to reduce the burden of depression if we can improve our ability to identify who currently has it and our ability to predict who might develop it in the future. Technological advances like machine learning (ML) may help us do so, and algorithms have already started to be integrated into medical settings to help with the detection of other diseases and disorders. However, preliminary evidence suggests that machine learning algorithms are biased against people of color, both in healthcare generally, and in mental healthcare specifically. Thus, a central question is not just whether ML detection of depression works, but also WHOM it works for. The proposed study will investigate if improving training set representation and including social determinants of health as predictors reduces racial/ethnic bias in an algorithm predicting depressive disorder diagnosis in the electronic health record.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (major depressive disorder)
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development
Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI)","Scientific Approaches
The study will use the NIH All of Us dataset (Controlled Tier) to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts who will receive a depressive disorder diagnosis in their electronic health record. A preliminary algorithm (the ‘development-as-usual’ algorithm) will be built in accordance with common practices in the current literature and will be assessed for racial/ethnic bias. Then, we will test the effectiveness of two bias mitigation strategies: 1) increasing racial/ethnic diversity in the training set, 2) including more diverse predictors as features, and 3) combining strategies 1 and 2.","Anticipated Findings
We expect that the ‘development-as-usual’ algorithm will exhibit significant bias against people of color when predicting depressive diagnoses. We expect that each bias mitigation strategy will reduce bias, with the most significant bias reduction conferred by the combination of both strategies.
Many have proposed that improving our ability to predict and detect depression could reduce the worldwide burden of the disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that if we deploy the algorithms currently being developed, there is a significant risk of algorithmic bias that could improve circumstances for some groups while increasing disparities in mental health treatment for others. Therefore, it is extremely important that AI developers attend to and attempt to mitigate algorithmic bias.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This research aims to understand relations between mental health disorders including latent classes, rates of comorbidity, and patterns between familial diagnoses and self-diagnoses. Additionally, we aim to understand how social determinants of health including neighborhood characteristics, adverse experiences, educational opportunity, and discrimination impact rates of psychiatric diagnoses. In particular, we are interested in examining different latent classifications of mental health diagnoses between racial and ethnics identities to elucidate unique needs across identities and how racial and ethnic identity may interact with other demographic (e.g., gender) and social determinant (e.g., adverse childhood experiences, nativity) to predict likelihood of experiencing mental health disorders.
This work will be used to inform public health initiatives, clinical interventions, and intervention and prevention efforts at the individual, familial, and community levels.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Latent class analytic approaches will be used to derive latent classifications of mental health disorders for the full sample and by racial and ethnic identity. In addition, categorical and linear regression approaches will be utilized to examine relations between social determinants of health and latent class membership. We also plan to use structural equation modeling approaches to examine various models of psychopathology, such as common factors models, and pathways from social determinants to factors of psychopathology.
We plan to use data from self-report surveys and medical records to examine variables related to mental health diagnoses (self and family), sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., nativity, gender, education, race), neighborhood characteristics, discrimination, religiosity, adverse childhood experiences, and perceived stress.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that there may be different latent classes of mental health disorders as a function of racial and ethnic identities. We anticipate that common factors models of psychopathology will  fit the data for all groups; however, the strength of indicators as they relate to psychopathology will differ. For example,  we hypothesize religiosity will demonstrate a stronger protective effect for Black and African American individuals compared to White.
Findings will contribute to the scientific knowledge by elucidating similarities and differences in the presentation of psychopathology between racial and ethnic groups. It will contribute to our understanding of risk and protective factors for psychopathology and the strength of indicators between groups. These findings have clinical (e.g., screening measures, risk of comorbidity), social, and public policy (e.g., developing strategies to mitigate impact of ACEs) implications.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The prevalence of depression in older adulthood ranges from 6-9% in primare care samples, and is commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated. Growing mental health workforce shortages and few mental health providers accepting Medicare compound these difficulties. While efforts to manage depression in primary care have advanced greatly, less than half of older adults receive effective treatment, and of those 30% develop treatment-resistant depression. Thus, there is a pressing need to understand the real world landscape of depression care for older adults ≥ 60 years, including screening rates, treatment approaches, and effectiveness of treatment.","Project Purpose(s)

This project will examine the link between exercise and mental health outcomes in adults diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While a range of medications are available to treat the difficulties in focus and executive function that characterize all types of ADHD, these medications are not primarily targeted to mental health issues comorbid to ADHD. Research has shown that people with ADHD experience an elevated rate of mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, which can cause significant impacts in quality of life.
It is well-known that exercise leads to significant benefits for mental health for all populations.  One interest for this project is to examine whether there is a stronger (or weaker) exercise-mental health link for people with ADHD. This project will compare the correlation between these two variables for ADHD and non-ADHD populations and evaluate if there is a statistically significant difference.","Project Purpose(s)

•	Vigorous Physical Activity: During the last 7 days, did you do vigorous physical activities like heavy lifting, digging, aerobics, or fast bicycling?
•	Moderate Physical Activity: Think about all the moderate activities that you did in the last 7 days. During the last 7 days, did you do moderate physical activity like carrying light loads, bicycling at a regular pace, or doubles tennis?

Young adults (ages 18 to 26 years) who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are at significant risk for inadequate access to mental healthcare and mental illness due to societal stigma, marginalization, and exclusion.  Approximately 54% of LGBTQ youth and young adults in the US report unmet need for mental health care, and levels of unmet need are higher for LGBTQ racial/ethnic minorities. This study aims to investigate how healthcare system and social determinant of health factors shape mental healthcare access among LGBTQ young adults. The aims of the study are to:
a.	Characterize racial/ethnic differences in mental healthcare access among LGBTQ sub-groups;
b.	Examine the relative importance of healthcare and social determinant of health factors in explaining unmet need for mental healthcare and mental health outcomes; and
c.	Investigate how interactions with healthcare providers influence unmet need for mental healthcare and mental health outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)

This cross-sectional study will use survey data from the 'All of Us' study with a sub-sample of adults who self-identify as sexual or gender minorities in the demographics survey.  We will examine social determinants of health (Neighborhood, Social support, Discrimination, Food security, Housing, Stress, Spiritual life, Language) and healthcare factors (insurance, cost barriers to care, distance to care, transportation, interactions with healthcare providers) as potential explanatory factors for understanding drivers of unmet mental health need and mental well-being among LGBTQ young adults. We will assess differences among LGBTQ sub-groups as well as racial/ethnic subgroups, as these groups are heterogenous and may experience different barriers to mental healthcare access and utilization. We plan to use multivariate models in R to examine which social determinants of health and healthcare factors are the highest priority to target to address unmet mental healthcare needs.","Anticipated Findings

We carried out a zebrafish genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a motivated behavior that resulted in over 30 significant Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). We found that genes in these QTLs were, more often than expected by chance, associated with mental health disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Moreover, we found 19 sequence elements that are conserved between zebrafish and humans and contain at least one zebrafish genome-wide significant variant. Here, our goal is to further explore the conserved sequence elements and SNPs within them in the human data to determine whether genotype-phenotype associations can be detected, especially with respect to mental health phenotypes.","Project Purpose(s)

In this study, we will compare health survey data and electronic health record (EHR) acquired data to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Latinx and Asian Americans using data from the All of Us program. Note: This workspace is a duplicate of our organization's ""Asian American Health"" workspace and is an extension of the project being worked on in the original workspace.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will develop frequency tables to compare the prevalence of mental health conditions (i.e., depression and anxiety) among Latinx and Asian Americans in the All of Us data. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models will be used to examine the association between sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, sex, income, education, insurance status, place of birth) and mental health conditions (i.e., depression and anxiety) as reported in both the health survey and EHR data. Analysis for Latinx and Asian Americans will be run separately.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that both Latinx and Asian Americans will be less likely to report a mental health diagnosis in the health survey compared to EHRs. In particular, we expect that older adults and foreign-born populations will report a lower prevalence of mental health diagnoses in the health survey compared to EHRs.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The escalating burden of severe obesity in women of reproductive age has driven a growing utilization of weight loss surgery (WLS) in this population. Despite benefits such as reduced incidence of gestational diabetes, a pregnancy after WLS is considered high-risk given the elevated rate of various adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, there have been serious concerns about the negative impact of WLS on maternal mental health, particularly related to depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality. These mental disorders increase the risk for severe maternal morbidity by 50% and are the leading cause of maternal mortality.
We propose to use All of Us data to accomplish two specific aims. Aim 1 Determine the individual and composite prevalence of depression, substance use disorder, and suicidality in pregnant women post-WLS. Aim 2 Examine the association of composite mental disorders with severe maternal morbidity post-WLS.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
For Aim 1, we will use t-test to compare the prevalence of mental disorders between pregnant women post-WLS and comparison groups. For Aim 2, we will apply logistic regression to examine the association between mental disorders and severe maternal morbidity, adjusting for factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and pregnancy complications.","Anticipated Findings
This study is of clinical significance because the findings will aid clinicians in offering more informed counseling regarding the risk-benefit profiles of preconception WLS. Also, this study carries policy relevance. Current policies aiming to enhance perinatal mental health care mainly target traditional high-risk groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status. This study will raise awareness about the mental health burden faced by women conceiving post-WLS, supporting future advocacy for the inclusion of their needs into policy formulation. Moreover, while national guidelines for post-WLS pregnancy management have been published, mental health was a missing piece. This study can, therefore, foster efforts to develop more inclusive guidelines that incorporate mental health aspects, to optimize maternal care post-WLS.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We hypothesize that Asian and Pacific islanders who live in the Midwest experience different degrees of mental health problems and may have less access to mental health services than individuals of the same racial and ethnic identities who live in other regions of the United States. We will explore the following research questions:
1. What is the proportion of AAPIs in the Midwest who experience mental health issues?
2. What is the proportion of AAPIs in the Midwest who use mental health services?
- 2a. Does the proportion of AAPIs in the Midwest using mental health services significantly differ from that of other U.S. regions?
3. What is the proportion of AAPIs in Missouri who utilize mental health services?

We will use the following All of Us datasets to answer our research questions: 1) The Basics, 2) Overall Health,  3) Personal and Family Health History, 4) Conditions, and 5) Health Care Access and Utilization.
The study cohort will include individuals who identify as Asian or Pacific Islander and who live in the Midwest. We will calculate the proportion of the study cohort who have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety reaction/panic disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, an eating disorder, social phobia, or a personality disorder. We will then calculate the proportion of the study cohort who have seen or talked to a mental health professional in the past 12 months. We will use the chi-square test to determine whether the answer to these questions differ by race, age group, gender, rural residence (rural or urban residence), state in the Midwest, and U.S. Census region.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this study will bring awareness to the unique mental health issues that AAPIs face in the Midwest, compared to regions with larger AAPI populations.

Emerging adulthood is a unique developmental period between adolescence and adulthood, characterized by instability across multiple domains of life.  Literature suggests that emerging adults with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for mental health difficulties and reduced quality of life. However, much of the literature has focused on emerging adults within a single academic institution and there is a great need to explore these health outcomes among a more diverse sample of emerging adults. We aim to utilize the All of Us data to ascertain health profiles among emerging adults with chronic medical conditions and identify modifiable factors associated with these health profiles. By employing a biopsychosocial framework, we hope to ascertain salient factors that could be targeted to improve health outcomes for this underserved population. Initial exploration of the available data and sample sizes will drive planned analyses and specific research questions.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
An initial exploration of the datasets are required to determine what data is available for emerging adult participants and which datasets can be best utilized to answer our overall research question. Once the datasets are chosen, specific health indicators and associated factors will be selected. To determine health profiles, latent profile analysis will be utilized which takes a person-centered approach to understanding patterns of symptoms and characteristics. Health profiles will be analyzed based on a number of mental (e.g., depressive and anxious symptoms) and physical health (e.g., fatigue, exercise, cortisol) indicators, which will be selected during the initial exploration of the datasets. After the optimal class solution is identified, the R3STEP procedure, which employs multinomial logistic regression, will be utilized to assess predictors of class membership.","Anticipated Findings
It is anticipated that a variety of health profiles will be identified, which will be characterized by unique sets of symptoms (e.g., depressive and anxious symptoms) and health outcomes (e.g., high cortisol, fatigue, low physical activity). Although a priori hypotheses are not appropriate for latent profile analyses, we do expect that results will yield a solution with more than three profiles (e.g., good health, moderate symptoms, poor health), as the analytic approach is expected to identify a more nuanced picture of health. We expect that several biopsychosocial factors will be associated with specific health profiles, indicating that some factors increase or decrease risk for particular patterns of health indicators. Some factors that will be considered include socioeconomic status, experience of discrimination, social support, healthcare access, ACES, family history, spirituality, and coping skills.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Disparities exist within the treatment of chronic pain and substance use.  Racial/ethnic disparities in the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pain have been extensively documented, with marginalized groups (i.e., racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority groups; low SES) consistently reporting greater pain-related functional impairment and are less likely to receive  to receive adequate treatment for their pain. Similarly, patients belonging to minoritized groups endorse higher rates of substance use and misuse, enter treatment later while also being less likely to complete, and evince higher substance-related morbidity and mortality. These racial/ethnic inequalities in physical and mental health extend from the civilian population to military veterans.  The overarching goals of this study are to examine reciprocal associations among SDoH (e.g., perceived medical discrimination), pain, substance use (e.g., nicotine/tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, opioids), and veteran status.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We have a workspace utilizing the Registered Tier Dataset v6 that investigates the associations among SDoH, pain, and SUD in the overarching All of Us sample. As directed by the All of Us Helpdesk, we will export and download versions of notebooks without outputs from that workspace and upload them into the Controlled Tier Workspace for the current workspace, including: electronic health records and items from several questionnaires (e.g., “The Basics,” “Lifestyle,” “Social Determinants of Health,” and “Healthcare Access & Utilization”). The study sample will focus on adults aged 18 and older who endorse current pain (EHR), report current every or someday use of at least one substance, and have available data pertaining to SDoH and healthcare access and utilization. We will then use the Controlled Tier dataset v7 to use the Veteran Status variable as well as other variables that may mediate relationships among SDoH, pain, and SUD across the two populations (e.g., Genomic, EHR).","Anticipated Findings
Overall, we anticipate positive associations between SDoH and worse health outcomes among individuals with co-occurring pain and substance use. Limited research has examined SDoH in this context, and these results may elucidate drivers of disparities and inequities in pain-substance use trajectories/outcomes. While we expect to confirm that these associations are qualitatively consistent across the Veteran and non-Veteran population, previous studies have noted important differences in these populations in the prevalence and effect of SDoH, pain, and SUD on physical and mental health depending on specifics of each of these variables, indicating that the associations among SDoH and worse health outcomes among individuals with co-occurring pain and substance in the Veteran population may differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the non-Veteran population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The datasets which will be used in this study are All of Us, the UK Biobank, and FinnGen. UK Biobank is a large biobank study in the United Kingdom which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease, including more than 500,000 participants to date. The FinnGen project collected biological samples from 500,000 participants in Finland over six years with the aim of improving health through genetic research, covering 10% of the whole population. I will apply GWAS, polygenic risk scoring, Mendelian randomization, and genetic correlation analyses. Polygenic risk scores provides a measure of your disease risk due genes, Mendelian randomization uses measured variation in genes of known function to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease. Genetic correlation is the correlation of phenotypic effects by genetic variants across the genome on two phenotypes.","Anticipated Findings
As mentioned previously, endometriosis is a common, but understudied disease. It is currently unknown which genetic factors are causal for the disease. Furthermore, there are only three studies that investigated the genomic relationship between endometriosis and mental health so far, and none of them applied polygenic risk scores to do so. We will advance the field by investigating the genetic relationship between mental health (focusing on psychological trauma), which will be highly valuable for the field. We anticipate that women who went through childhood trauma has endometriosis more often, and genetic predisposition to trauma also predisposes for endometriosis diagnosis.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Transgender populations, comprised of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth, face substantial mental health and substance use inequities compared with cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) people in the United States. These inequities include heightened risk of psychological distress, depression, and suicidality, as well as increased binge drinking and substance use disorders, and are driven by high exposure to stigma and discrimination. Though research has consistently linked stigma-related stress at the individual and interpersonal levels to negative mental health and substance use outcomes, fewer studies have assessed structural stigma, defined as the systematic devaluation and marginalization of transgender people. We aim to investigate the association between state-level structural stigma and mental and behavioral health.","Project Purpose(s)

We will use data from the All of Us Study to, (1a) among transgender people, investigate the associations between state-level structural stigma and a range of mental health and substance use outcomes, and (1b) among the total sample, investigate whether the association between transgender vs. cisgender identity and these outcomes varies by state-level structural stigma.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that state-level structural stigma is associated with poorer mental and behavioral health outcomes among transgender people, and that state-level structural stigma is also associated with narrower differences in mental and behavioral health outcomes between transgender and cisgender people.

in what ways are persons connected to an individual with sickle cell anemia affected by adverse mental health outcomes? Is there a psychosocial impact tied to sickle cell anemia? what are the effects of sickle cell therapies and interventions? Sickle Cell Anemia is common, with most patients not disclosing their diagnosis.

we expect to find mental health issues related to sickle cell disease--especially depression. People without diseases go through depression, and so the experience of sickle cell disease might be a risk factor for a depressive episode or episodes. we expect the African American population to experience fewer therapeutic tendencies or interventions as cooping for the disease. This is due to a stigma around mental health and a lack of access to mental health resources in the African American community. there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of sickle cell anemia and mental health.

Researcher have shown that there was an increase in discrimination some points of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many researchers have suggested a myriad of reasons why this may be. However, it remains unclear what the correlates and distribution of discrimination experiences were for different groups of people. In addition, it is unknown how these experiences increased or decreased during high points in the pandemic. Lastly, it is unclear how social isolation and the disruption in human connection (e.g. with family, friends, etc.) may have been associated with the mental health effects of discrimination during the pandemic. This is of considerable public health significance because we must not only address the mental health needs of those in need, but understand the specific correlates of mental health, such as discrimination, to prevent such an uptick in mental health distress due to discrimination during the next pandemic.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
I plan on using the COPE data source from May 2020-February 2021 to examine changes in experiences of discrimination, social isolation, human connection, and mental health. I will utilize hierarchical linear models to asses random and fixed effects, as well as potential mediators and moderators. The COPE has questions related to discrimination experiences in each wave, family connections, social isolation, and mental health. I will also utilize the main survey to access basic sociodemographic information (e.g. race/ethnicity, age, socio economic status, etc.) to utilize as covariates in my analyses.","Anticipated Findings
Based on the extant research literature, I believe that we will find that there is a general uptick in perceived discrimination during COVID. In addition, we hypothesize that as discrimination experiences increase, so does poor mental health. We also hypothesize that social isolation will mediate the longitudinal relationship between perceived discrimination and perceive social isolation and perceived mental health. Lastly, we hypothesize a mediated-moderated model whereby those with perceived positive human connections who experience greater discrimination will report less social isolation and thus less poor mental health compared to those with perceived negative human connections who experience greater discrimination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Some of the specific questions we intend to study are: Are there significant differences between Blacks and Latinos in regard to physical activity and nutrition, Are there any barriers that prevent access to proper nutrition and physical activity, and What are the impacts on adverse health for depression and anxiety? These three questions are important for understanding if race is a factor in health disparities, and how we can promote better nutrition and more physical activity across communities in East Los Angeles. After doing a literature review on several different articles related to nutrition and physical activity, some of the gaps in the findings included factors that affect nutritional intake and physical activity the most, and the impacts that they can have on mental health. As it’s not well understood how physical health can impact mental health, the three questions are relevant for decreasing health disparities and increasing awareness for better physical and mental health.","Project Purpose(s)

Appropriate statistical analyses will be used to determine if significant differences or relationships exist between the parameters being measured.

We anticipate finding a positive relationship between high income Black and Latino households and proper access to nutrition and physical activity. We also anticipate finding behavior and low income to be some of the major causes for barriers that prevent proper nutrition and physical activity for Blacks and Latinos.

This will be an epidemiology study that aims to interrogate the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and COVID-19 symptoms.  Depression is the most common mental health condition and affects more than 300 million people around the world. It is also a leading cause of suicidal death.  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected >200 million people and caused >4.5 million death since its outbreak in late 2019.  It is known that people with mental health problems may have worse physical health, lower immunity, and higher susceptibility to infection. We hypothesize that individuals with MDD before the COVID-19 outbreak are more easily affected by COVID-19 than those without MDD; and vice versa, individuals affected with COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to develop or deteriorate depression symptoms than those not affected. A clear relationship between MDD and COVID-19 status will help to establish better screening and prevention strategy for both two health conditions.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (major depressive disorder)","Scientific Approaches
Both electronic health records and survey data from All of Us program will be used to examine the relationship between MDD and COVID-19. The definition of MDD will come from electronic health record (ICD9/10) and PHQ-9 questionnaire from COPE survey. COVID-19 symptoms will also come from COPE survey.  We will describe the MDD population statistics before and after COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. COPE surveys from 3 different time points (May, June, July/August 2020) will be leveraged to perform combined analysis and time-varying analysis. Environmental variables (e.g., demographic, socioeconomics status, and disease comorbidities) will be extracted as confounder or covariates in our statistical modeling. Univariable analysis will be carried out by chi-square test, log-rank test, and correlation. Multivariable analysis will be performed by logistic regression, cox regression, and generalized linear mixed models.","Anticipated Findings
Expected outcomes will include: 1) descriptive statistic of MDD and COVID-19 by different stratum in All of Us populations; 2) correlation and association pattern between MDD symptoms and COVID-19 status or monitoring strategies; 3) risk stratification model for COVID-19 onset and development that include MDD symptoms as predictors.
With all above expected outcomes, our findings will  not only provide additional insights on how to better manage MDD by controlling COVID-19 affection, but also have better strategy of preventing COVID-19 affection by screening high risk MDD patients for earlier intervention and vaccination.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Health disparities are adverse differences in cancer burden experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and medically underserved area/populations (MUA/P). An individual diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) faces a variety of physical and mental health-related issues and social and financial challenges. Minorities and MUA/P are more likely to suffer from adverse events (AEs), have a lower quality of life, and experience greater financial hardship. MM survivors of MUA/P face an increased financial toxicity and differences in palliative care. New MM treatments have improved clinical courses and survival. However, these differ in their mode of action, safety profile, and AEs. The goal of this study is to establish the benchmark for an integrated systematic investigation to assess toxicities of different MM drugs due to acquired drug resistance and disease relapse to improve the survivorship experience for minorities and MUA/P by minimizing culturally sensitive intervention.","Project Purpose(s)

We intend to assess outcomes and survival in MM clinical trials for MUA/P and minorities based on genetically defined traits. A pooled analysis of all MM therapeutic datasets will be conducted. We will evaluate the relationship between time-to-event outcomes and different traits using age-adjusted stratified Cox models. Drug-associated genes and phenotype entries will be analyzed to search for clinical synopses and highly conserved signal transduction pathways. Cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and stem cell self-renewal are controlled by these pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may induce these signaling pathways in MM. We plan to study various (un)known proinflammatory signaling pathways including NF-κB, STAT3-10, PI3K/AKT, growth factors, and Wnt-β catenin based on biological stress responses, epigenetic modification, and RNAseq expression that may help in the initiation and progression of MM.","Anticipated Findings
Upon comprehensive analysis of the various pro-inflammatory signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of MM, several antiapoptotic proteins and antiapoptotic signaling cascades will be identified which may contribute to the antiapoptotic genomics and phenotype of MM cells. Our goal is to uncover mechanisms that may contribute to the enhanced survival of MM cells and their resistance to drug therapy. Understanding these mechanisms is essential to making progress in the treatment of MM. Additionally, we may be able to identify potential inhibitors of proinflammatory signaling pathways derived from natural sources that can be used both for the prevention and treatment of MM in MUA/P and minorities. Having an understanding of the causes and consequences of signaling pathways in MM will facilitate the development of strategies that will target social determinants of health which are factors in the social environment impacting health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

1. How do quality of life and overall self-reported health and mental health outcomes among individuals with vaginal or vulvar cancers compare to individuals a) without cancer, b) with breast cancer, c) with other gynecological cancers (ovarian, cervical, endometrial cancers).
2. Exploratory: Do these outcomes differ by demographics within the group of individuals with vaginal or vulvar cancers.
Rationale: Vaginal and vulvar cancers are stigmatized cancers. They are also quite rare and therefore difficult to study in local cohorts. Anecdotal evidence from pilot studies suggests that cancer survivorship outcomes such as quality of life are worse among individuals with vaginal or vulvar cancers compared to other cancer populations.","Project Purpose(s)

We hypothesize that individuals with vaginal and vulvar cancers on average report worse quality of life / overall self-reported health outcomes compared with those who have no cancer, breast cancer, or other gynecologic cancers.
Potentially, some variation in QOL outcomes is explained by demographic characteristics, hence the adjusted analysis accounting for demographic and clinical factors.

We will explore the social determinants of health (e.g. social support, neighborhood cohesion, loneliness, housing security, etc.) and their impact on mental disorders such as depression and anxiety by utilizing the survey and EHR data within the All of Us cohort.
Some questions of interest are:
1) Are the determinants associated with risk or protection for mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety?
2) How do the associations look like for different demographics including:
Age, sex assigned at birth, race and ethnicity, residence (urban, suburban, rural), sexual orientation, income, and education.

Can wearable technology accurately monitor and track depression symptoms in individuals over time?
What is the relationship between physical activity levels measured by wearables and depression symptoms?
Can wearables help predict depressive episodes and facilitate early intervention?
What are the ethical considerations surrounding the use of wearable technology in mental health research and treatment?
The question of wearables and depression is important because depression is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Wearable technology may offer a convenient and cost-effective method for tracking symptoms and improving early detection and treatment of depression. Additionally, studying wearables and depression may contribute to a broader understanding of the relationship between physical activity, mental health, and overall well-being.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (major depressive disorder)","Scientific Approaches
I will be studying the relationship between wearables and depression using a variety of research methods and tools to answer my scientific questions. Specifically, I plan to use longitudinal observational studies to evaluate the relationship between physical activity levels, sleep patterns, and other physiological parameters measured by wearables and depression symptoms. Additionally, I plan to use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets generated by wearable devices, with the goal of identifying patterns and trends that can help predict and prevent depression. Finally, I plan to conduct ethnographic research to explore how individuals use wearables to monitor their mental and physical health and how these devices can be integrated into depression management programs. To analyze the data collected from wearables, I plan to use data analysis tools such as R or Python, and statistical software such as SPSS or STATA for statistical analysis.","Anticipated Findings
Wearables can accurately monitor and track depression symptoms in individuals over time, and they can provide valuable data to inform treatment decisions.
There is a significant relationship between physical activity levels measured by wearables and depression symptoms, and increasing physical activity may help alleviate depression symptoms.
Wearables may help predict depressive episodes and facilitate early intervention by detecting changes in physiological parameters and alerting individuals or healthcare providers.
Ethnographic research may identify barriers to wearables' adoption and use among individuals with depression, such as concerns over data privacy and security or perceived stigmatization.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Anosmia, or the loss of sense of smell, has been recognized as one of the common symptoms of COVID-19. Studying anosmia is important in the context of COVID-19 because it can aid in early detection and diagnosis of the disease, especially in asymptomatic patients. Moreover, anosmia can have significant implications for mental health outcomes as it has been associated with depression, anxiety, and a decrease in quality of life. Additionally, research has shown that loss of sense of smell can impact behavioral outcomes such as appetite and food intake. Understanding the impact of anosmia on behavioral and mental health outcomes is crucial in order to develop effective interventions and support for those affected. Therefore, further research on anosmia is essential in order to improve our understanding of COVID-19 and its associated impact on individuals' health and wellbeing.","Project Purpose(s)

Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to determine key features associated with those that suffer short and long term anosmia in both in the context of COVID and non-COVID indications.","Anticipated Findings
Research on anosmia and its relationship with COVID-19 can provide important insights into the prevalence and severity of this symptom in infected individuals. Understanding the potential long-term effects of anosmia on mental health and behavior can also inform the development of interventions to support affected individuals. Furthermore, investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying anosmia and its relationship with COVID-19 can provide new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease. Overall, these findings could contribute to the body of scientific knowledge in the field by improving our understanding of COVID-19 and its associated impact on health and wellbeing. Additionally, it could provide important information for the development of clinical guidelines and interventions for individuals with anosmia or COVID-19.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The question we intend to study is to examine physical activity/exercise among stroke survivors and compare this between the stroke belt states and the non-stroke belt states. In addition, covariates such as education level, income, race/ethnicity will be examined. The primary outcome measures are physical and mental health related quality of life and if these differ between the states (stroke belt and non-stroke belt), different groups of individuals such as race/ethnicity, and by the cumulative amount if exercise achieved. The amount of exercise that stroke survivors get has been shown to influence health related quality of life and this data set will give us more insight into differences between regions and races.","Project Purpose(s)

Understanding health disparities of older SGM is vital to be able to create evidence based geriatric SGM care.
- Do older SGM have a higher burden of frailty?
- Do older SGM have different health care utilization (PCP/mental health visits) compared to non-SGM?
- Do older SGM have difference use of potentially inappropriate medications compared to non-SGM?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
The population is over 50yrs old. SGM are self-identified via survey questions. Health care utilization is derived from survey data and includes PCP and mental health visits. Eventually we plan to use EHR data for both utilization( hospitalization/ED visits) and drug/Rx information. Frailty is assessed by the FI we created for AoU.

How does the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals with visual impairment compare to individuals without visual impairment?
Visual disorders are debilitating diseases that account for a majority of irreversible blindness in the United States. Visual impairment can be a source of disability amongst affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought several challenges to individuals with visual impairment, including difficulty accessing care and increased concerns about social interaction. As an example, rapid at-home testing is inaccessible to visually impaired individuals without a caretaker as they are unable to interpret the results. If individuals with visual impairment are suffering disproportionately throughout the pandemic, new tools and policies to increase access to care and mental health services may help mitigate this disparity. Better understanding the COVID-19 experience of people with visual impairment will allow us to address this issue.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Visual Impairment)","Scientific Approaches
Our study cohort will be individuals who have previously had an eye examination. Of these individuals, we will identify individuals who have a visual disorder by their ICD-9/ICD-10 codes or SNOMED diagnoses. We will then utilize the COVID-19 Participant Exposure survey to identify different “spheres” of the COVID-19 pandemic experience, including access to COVID-19 testing, social distancing experiences, and wellbeing. Univariate and multivariate regression models (controlling for age, sex, race, and other covariates) will be used to predict the relationship between the relationship between the visual impairment and the COVID-19 experience. Sub-analyses may be performed in certain demographics to see how the risk for a visual disorder may modulate in certain populations.","Anticipated Findings
Previous studies on this subject have been limited by their sample size (<300 individuals) and their limited sample population (>95% White, or not reporting race). The All of Us database is the largest and most racially diverse US database, where more than 50% of participants are from racial and ethnic minorities. Large-scale ophthalmology research often has a majority White study population; the opportunity to study the association between visual impairment and COVID-19 experience in individuals from historically underrepresented backgrounds will help us ascertain how this relationship might shift in certain populations. The large sample size may allow us to discover associations in populations where previous analyses were underpowered.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I am currently exploring the data to formalize a specific research question. I am interested in the relationship between mental health symptoms and experiencing discrimination as well as the relationship between mental health diagnoses and experiencing discrimination. Are mental illness symptoms or mental health diagnoses more strongly related to reporting experiencing discrimination? Additionally, are there meaningful differences in people's experiences of discrimination based on the type of mental illness or level of severity of their mental health issue(s)?","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
People 18 years and older who have answered survey questions about mental health symptoms, diagnoses, and experiences of discrimination will be included in this study. Participants will be categorized based on the severity of mental illness symptoms (normal, mild, moderate, or severe) and will also be classified based on their diagnosis(es).
Descriptive statistics (cross-tabulations with chi-squared tests; means with t-tests) will be used to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of individuals with mental health issues based on symptoms reported and also done separately based on the reported mental health diagnosis(es). Bivariate regression analyses will be performed to analyze the predictors of an individual endorsing a1) mental illness symptoms, a2) mental health diagnoses, and b) discrimination/stigma to get a sense of the data and covariates.","Anticipated Findings
This study should clarify whether mental illness symptoms and/or mental health disorder diagnoses are predictive of reporting and experiencing discrimination/stigma. If so, it should help identify whether one is more predictive than the other as well as which specific symptoms and/or diagnoses are most strongly related to experiencing discrimination/stigma. This will be particularly useful for anti-stigma campaigns and other programs because we will be able to identify those who are likely the most in need of intervention. The results can also help raise awareness about the different and nuanced experiences of anyone who falls under the umbrella of suffering from mental illness.
Based on some previous research I anticipate folks who fall within the categories of having serious or severe mental illness will report more experiences of discrimination/stigma compared to those who fall into categories of less severe mental illness.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Disease Focused Research (heart disease)","Scientific Approaches
The dependent variable was incidence of the condition cardiovascular disease, which would include at least one of the following diagnoses – heart disease, congenital heart disease, coronary arteriosclerosis. The condition was evaluated as a nominal variable. The main independent variable was perceived neighborhood safety which was derived from the survey prompt, “My neighborhood is safe.” There were 4 Likert scale responses: agree, strongly agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. I will consider the covariates of housing ownership and mental health and use logistic regressions to run analyses between these variables and covariates.","Anticipated Findings
I hypothesize that a lower perception of neighborhood safety will be a significant factor of cardiovascular disease among participants. This would be very helpful when considering social determinants of health and could assist with policy design and community interventions. Previous studies have looked at perceived neighborhood safety and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and have found significant results.

According to a 2021 poll by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, Nearly half of all Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American and LGBTQ+ individuals say they have personally experienced increased mental health challenges between July 2020 and July 2021. Half or more of adults surveyed said they have frequently experienced feeling tired or having less energy (63%); had difficulty sleeping (58%); felt nervous, anxious or on edge (51%); and had trouble relaxing (50%). We propose to use the All of Us data to study if the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the mental health of underrepresented population while controlling for other factors e.g. urban vs. rural, and if so, shed lights on its impact.","Project Purpose(s)

Military servicemembers and veterans  generally have increased access to healthcare, including mental healthcare through VA and DoD healthcare systems. However, stigma about mental health has been an issue in military populations. Therefore, it is unclear what patterns of mental health care (pharmacological and psychological) that individuals are receiving and whether this differs by military status.
Some previous work has shown that military status was not associated with these services but used a small sample among college students that was further limited by the number of participants using psychological services.

Health disparities are critical factors that negatively impact the health of Hispanics in the United States. Health Disparities have been defined as inequities that exist between various groups that pertain to health outcomes or access to healthcare when compared to the general population (Healthy People 2020). According to the Institute of Medicine (2003), disparities exist among Hispanics in preventive healthcare for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health, and Hispanics lack access to healthcare (Quinn et al., 2011).  This study will document differences in COVID-19 infection among Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants and investigating the mediating effect of infection on income, job, and health access measures. The results will demonstrate whether COVID-19 infection increased economic, job, and health access disparities among Hispanic participants.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will define a cohort on All of Us that includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants who self-report COVID-19 infection, have record of a positive PCR test for COVID-19, or have COVID-19 antigens. We will produce data visualization of key results and build logistic regression models predicting ethnicity build using the selected variables of COVID-19 infection and related social determinants of health.  Appropriate interactions will be included to produce a model with explanatory power and parsimonious fit.","Anticipated Findings
1) The Hispanic group lacks access to health care resources
2) There weren’t as many job losses among the Hispanic group, and this could be a result of many working essential jobs where work-from-home was not possible
3) Low income among Hispanic group, in comparison to other race & ethnic groups. As a result, access to health care is low, but exposure to the COVID-19 virus is high due to essential jobs.
4) The following variables are associated with ethnicity: access to a doctor, having a positive COVID test, having a lower annual income, not having access to health insurance, is less likely to access a COVID vaccination, is less likely to have a person to take them to the doctor, having reduced pay, and are less likely to own a home.","Demographic Categories of Interest

My goal is to explore the All of Us database in order to establish a relationship between eating habits and the development of psychological disorders (specifically ADHD) in children. While the comorbidities of ADHD and eating disorders have been well-documented, it is less understood how poor diet during childhood (but not necessarily disordered eating behavior) may be used as a predictor of the development of mental illnesses in adolescents and adulthood; in other words, diet may be a kind of early warning sign for certain conditions. My investigation may also explore the long-term health effects of experiencing mental illness during childhood on diet in adulthood, as this represents the other side of the mental health to diet relationship.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
This study will focus on a broad population of participants with a diagnosed mental illness; while comparison between subpopulations of this cohort may yield interesting discoveries, the primary comparison will take place between participants with an ADHD diagnosis and a control participant population with no diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Preliminary background articles for this research have been accessed using PubMed, and I plan to complete the data analysis using R coding language as supported by All of Us.","Anticipated Findings
Based on previous studies, I do not expect to find evidence that diet contributes to the development of ADHD or other mental illnesses; however, it is my hope that my findings may reveal a correlation between favored diets or eating behavior in childhood and the development of mental illness down the road, so that future studies may investigate the link further. If there are dietary “early warning signs” in the development of future mental health disorders, this information can be used to aid early diagnosis and possibly reveal more about the origins of the disorders (linked genes, environmental factors, etc.). In addition, I hope that investigating the subsequent effect of living with ADHD on diet will reveal lesser known challenges faced by these individual, and help clinicians consider these factors as they may effect the overall physical health of their patients.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The goal of this project is to explore the ways in which perceived social support and perceived social isolation interact with each other and other stressors to impact mental health outcomes (e.g., depression and anxiety). Social isolation is a significant public health concern. Eradicating social isolation has been identified as one of the Grand Challenges for the field of social work and the AARP Foundation has identified social isolation as a key mission area. Social isolation is associated with a range of mental health outcomes. Gaining a better understanding of the antecedents (e.g., social stressors) of social isolation as well as the role social isolation plays in the development of negative mental health outcomes has important implications for the development of interventions. Furthermore, identifying the role of perceived social support can better elucidate these relationships and provide important information than can aide in the development of interventions.","Project Purpose(s)

Identification of additional methods and approaches may be identified upon further exploration of the data.","Anticipated Findings
It is anticipated that feelings of social isolation will (1) be associated with greater levels of mental distress, (2) greater reported stress will be associated with higher levels of social isolation, (3) the impact of stressors on social isolation will be buffered by social support. As noted above, by further explicating the ways in which stressors and social support impacts perceptions of social isolation, interventions can be developed and at-risk populations can be identified for the purposes of reducing perceived social isolation and therefore improving both physical and mental health outcomes.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Mechanisms involved in work-related disparities of bone health are complex given the bidirectional relationship between bone and brain which includes indirect
regulation through the peripheral nervous system and directly by releasing molecules that can cross the blood brain barrier. Accelerated biological aging has been linked to conditions including adult mental health disorders, health-related behaviors, and various chronic and age-related diseases. Telomere
length, a widely accepted biomarker of aging (BoA), has been linked to OP and musculoskeletal functioning. Telomere erosion rate can also vary in response to socioeconomic factors and psychosocial stress. Likewise, perturbations in circulating microRNAs and DNA methylation age, also BoA, are affected by SDOH. Thus, although little is known about whether occupational characteristics or job-related stress impact biological aging, it is possible that the relationship between work and bone health may be a result of accelerated aging.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development
Control Set","Scientific Approaches
The proposed study will leverage the extensive data resources of our existing Cincinnati Lead Study (CLS) prospective cohort which has experienced moderate to high levels of Pb exposure during their early life and is now in their early 40’s and involved in various occupational sectors. Aims: 1) Determine the association between workplace risk factors and combined bone and musculature health (bone fragility and neuromotor functions); 2) Identify biomarkers of aging (telomere length, DNA methylation, and circulating microRNAs) associated with workplace risk factors and how they relate to disparities in bone health; and 3) Identify perceptions of (physical and psychosocial) risks of work and associated work-based health protection and promotion strategies which are feasible among employers. Because the CLS cohort is relatively small (89 at last contact), we hope to explore AllOfUs data as a potential control and/or validation cohort.","Anticipated Findings
The core hypothesis of this project is that people experiencing work-related stressors (physical and psychosocial) exhibit poorer combined bone and musculature health outcomes and accelerated biological aging. Further, the association between work-related risk factors and combined bone and musculature health is exacerbated by preexisting social determinants of health, including early-life Pb exposure.","Demographic Categories of Interest

For this data we will report descriptive statistics of the collected variables in order to compare the social background of ESRD on HD patients who present to the ED. We will report means and confidence intervals for the Distressed Community Index Score and Social Vulnerability Index in order to compare established measurements of social determinants of health between ESRD on HD patients presenting to the ED and the general population. We will also use established scoring systems including ASSIST and PROMIS29 as described above in order to generate risk scores for participants.","Project Purpose(s)

I am still figuring out the exact tools and methods based on the dataset available variable for use.","Anticipated Findings
HD patients miss approximately 10% of all treatments. After a missed HD treatment there is a significant increase in risk of hospitalization, ED visits, and ICU admission. Not only are the monetary cost of ED HD approximately four times as expensive as in-center dialysis, but missed HD sessions contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in particularly vulnerable ESRD patients. Patients with depressive symptoms are more likely to miss HD, present to the ED, and face increased mortality due to their ESRD. In addition to depressive symptoms, smoking, pain, low health literacy, low baseline quality of life, and younger age have been found to influence missed HD. By identifying the specific reasons that patients miss HD, new interventions focused on getting patients to hemodialysis can be piloted and their impact on decreasing poor outcomes can be analyzed. It is important that this work be done to better serve this already vulnerable patient population.","Demographic Categories of Interest

(1) In addition, reports of anxiety and depressive disorders were also increased during the earlier months of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the same months in 2019. To date, the effects of COVID-19 related psychological distress and its associated outcomes remain largely un-investigated in communities of color partly due to stigmas surrounding mental health, medical distrust, and decreased behavioral health resource accessibility within these communities. (2-7) Results from this study are intended to highlight a need for continued expansion of equitable access to behavioral health resources and services among racial- ethnic minority communities.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
Data on a cohort of racial-ethnic minority patients will be collected from the All of Us COPE survey database and reviewed for baseline and sociodemographic information. Participants eligible for inclusion in this study are those who self-report their race or ethnicity as Hispanic and/or nonwhite. The period of time from which data will be collected will be May 2020 through July 2020. Medication misuse will be defined as affirmative responses to the query “did you use prescription opioids/stimulants/sedatives in any way a doctor did not direct you to use it?”. Psychological distress will be classified using questions assessing mood and anxiety based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression module and the Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) mental health rating scales. Both screening tools are based on the DSM-IV criteria for major depression and generalized anxiety disorder and have well-documented reliability and validity in literature. (8,9)","Anticipated Findings
This study intends to provide an analysis of the COPE survey data to investigate the relationship between substance misuse and COVID-19 induced psychological distress among racial-ethnic minorities. As the immensity of both direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 remains under explored, investigating this topic in our study is paramount to further understanding substance misuse and behavioral health within these vulnerable populations. The overarching goal of this study is to utilize the granularity of ethnicities and races in the All of Us program to supplement recently described increases in rates of substance misuse amongst various racial and ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are hopeful that this study will inform on an area of focus which could promote health equity and overall improved health outcomes for minority communities. Results of this study have great potential to inform health services and policies.","Demographic Categories of Interest

I  am studying Covid's impact on mental health and how it has impacted minorities. I  want to see how minorities responded to the pandemic due to the fact that they got fewer resources in their areas. I  want to see if mental health conditions improved or got worse during the pandemic.

This is a copy of a different workspace in order to access the controlled tier level sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data. It is well documented that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are at higher risk for housing instability and adverse mental health and substance use outcomes than individuals who identify as heterosexual. Many studies that previously examined these outcomes have been limited to large cities (e.g., New York City or Los Angeles) with few providing a nation-wide overview of these issues. The aims of this study are to: (1) examine housing differences by sexual orientation and gender identity and (2) assess the relationship between mental health and substance use outcomes and housing instability among LGBTQ people. Secondary aims include examining these differences by other sociodemographic characteristics including race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, and geographic location.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We plan to use most recent general All of Us dataset. We will examine the data using descriptive statistics including chi-square/ANOVA/t-tests to assess the general associations.

1) We hypothesize that individuals who identify as LGBTQ would be at higher risk for housing instability compared to those who identify as heterosexual. (2) Among those who identify as LGBTQ, we anticipate that those who are experiencing housing instability will also endorse adverse mental health and substance use outcomes. (3) We expect that there will be sociodemographic differences by race/ethnicity, income, educational attainment, and geography based on all outcomes assessed. The findings from this analysis will add to the LGBTQ health disparities literature as it will provide a national overview of these important stressors and issues. The findings can be used to inform housing, mental health, and substance use policies, programs, and initiatives at the national level, and can also be narrowed down geographically depending on the differences in results.","Demographic Categories of Interest

As a first step towards developing a mental healthcare system that is personalized, culturally responsive, and community-embedded, the aim of this project is to anticipate the development of adverse mental health conditions through early warning signals, paving the way for personalized just-in-time interventions. Specifically, this project will examine if critical slowing down, one early warning signal, occurs prior to the emergence of an adverse mental health conditions.
1. Evaluate whether digital health information (sleep, exercise, heart rate, activity level) anticipate/predict adverse mental health conditions (billing codes, prescription medication, mental health surveys).
2. Evaluate whether health surveys, participant demographics, contextual variables, physical measurements, anticipate the development of adverse mental health conditions (billing codes, medications) in the future?","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Adverse mental health conditions)
Social / Behavioral
Methods Development","Scientific Approaches
We will include participants if they were diagnosed with an adverse mental health condition (depression, anxiety, PTSD, sleep difficulties, or chronic pain) and if they have provided their digital health information (e.g., fitbit). With these participants, first, we will compute latent change score models for each outcome of interest from the baseline measure through the last assessment. Using the latent change score, we will be able to examine estimate the influence of predictors (baseline risk factors) over time on the development of adverse mental health conditions.
To examine the utility of early warning signals in anticipating the emergence of mental illness, using digital health information, we will identify moments of critical slowing down. In a longitudinal intensive time series, critical slowing down can be identified through autocorrelation, variance, kurtosis, and skewness. Testing different rolling window in the time series to identify the optimal point for anticipation.","Anticipated Findings
Although there are several effective interventions to alleviate the burden of adverse mental health conditions, many people do not have reliable access to them or face significant barriers to treatment, including lack of health insurance, availability of culturally relevant treatments, historical mistrust of healthcare services, and discrimination, lack of effectively trained providers, flaws in diagnostic systems, and implementation treatment gaps.
Developing, disseminating, and connecting patients to the right level of treatment would bridge some of these gaps in care.
Evaluating whether early warning signals occur prior to the emergence of adverse mental health conditions would have tremendous impact on prevention and intervention efforts. If early warning signals occur before the emergence of an adverse mental health condition then this would provide the framework for delivering just-in-time interventions, potentially transforming the delivery of mental healthcare.","Demographic Categories of Interest

We seek to study the effects of the 2016 Presidential election on mental health of adults in the United States, mediated by political leaning of their county and other demographic factors, including race and income.

From the All of Us dataset we plan to use medical data, including anxiety and depression diagnoses and medications, and demographic data, including race/ethnicity and income data. Outside of All of Us, we plan to bring in granular election result data, focusing on the vote counts and margins for Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton on the county level. We'll specifically be using the ""County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020"" available from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
We plan to use a variety of basic statistical tests, such as linear regression, to evaluate the effect of our independent variables, county political lean and demographic indicators, on our dependent variable, increase in mental health issues.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that increased Democratic vote share in a county correlates with higher levels of mental health issues in the time shortly following the 2016 Presidential election.

Is there a correlation between overall health and delays in receiving medical care in those who identify as women?
Historically, those who cannot easily access medical care have been underrepresented in research. Women in particular have faced challenges in accessing healthcare, which is critical as risk factors for chronic illnesses are becoming more prevalent in women of reproductive age (Daniel et al., 2018). In addition to unique reproductive and mental health issues (Daniel et al., 2018; Witt et al., 2009), there are approximately 38% of women who have one or more chronic diseases, compared to 30% of men (NCSL, 2015). We hypothesize that delays in receiving medical care are related to self-reports of “Fair” or “Poor” health, while those who had no delays reported their health as “Excellent,” “Very good,” or “Good.”","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
We will use responses from the Health Care Access & Utilization survey, specifically “yes” and “no” responses to questions about delays in receiving medical care during a 12-month period. We will include responses from the Overall Health survey, specifically self-reported health status. Using a chi-squared test in R, we will compare the overall health of women who delayed receiving medical care to the women who had no delay in receiving medical care. Poor health will be defined by “Fair” and “Poor” responses, while good health will be defined by “Excellent,” “Very good,” and “Good” responses. From the Data Browser , we found that 101,220 individuals assigned female at birth answered the questions from the Health Care Access & Utilization survey. Of the responses, a total of 84,260 indicated delays receiving medical care during a 12-month period. In this study, we will explore the relationship between overall health of those assigned female at birth and delays in receiving medical care.","Anticipated Findings
We hypothesize that delays in receiving medical care are related to self-reports of “Fair” or “Poor” health, while those who had no delays reported their health as “Excellent,” “Very good,” or “Good.” Delays in receiving medical care impact overall accessibility to health care services. The most common delay reported by women is out of pocket costs for some/all of the procedure, followed by nervousness about seeing a provider and an inability to take time off of work. These reasons could persist, limiting accessibility and utilization of healthcare for women and thus worsen chronic illnesses and/or postpone preventive care.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Asian Americans are the fastest growing group in the United States that is projected to double in size by 2060. However, the severity of mental health problems (e.g., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) experienced by Asian American cancer survivors are understudied, and even less is known at the Asian subgroup level (e.g., Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans). The severity of mental health problems among Asian American cancer survivors will be examined with the following cancer types: stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, liver, lung and bronchus, breast cancer, ovary, cervical, prostate, gallbladder, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and leukemia. These cancer sites were selected based on their overall contribution to Asian American mortality burden from 2003 to 2011, as well as data on Asian American cancer burden in 2016.

[Place Holder] The study plans to use data harmonization methods, by pooling data from various large-scale national public health datasets, combined with multilevel structural stigma indicators, including discriminatory laws, unequal policies, and negative population attitudes across states and counties, over two decades of time, to test three-level (clustered) models with multilevel predictors, both cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally.","Anticipated Findings
[Place Holder] Data harmonization will allow to answer important unaddressed questions, for example , how structural stigma across various levels (e.g., state, county, school district) can exert different effects on sexual minority mental health and coproduce adverse mental health, how county/school district policies may be particularly important during youth and adolescence while macro factors may have a larger role during adulthood, and how the level of urbanization (i.e., urban vs. rural) plays into this.

Most of empirical studies explored risk factors of mental health outcomes in the context of COVID-19, but few studies also identified potential protective factors that can mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes. The identifications of these protective factors can be critical in developing tailored health promotion interventions to reduce mental health disparities among those underserved populations.
The main research aims is to identify potential protective factors for mental health outcomes at multiple socioecological levels including individual level (resilience, physical activity), interpersonal level (e.g., social support), health institutional level (e.g., health service accessibility), and structural level (social determinants of health) adjusting pre-existing health condition including psychiatric disorders and other relevant factors . We will also conduct analysis for different underserved subgroups as the factors could vary by groups.","Project Purpose(s)

Individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) are at higher risk for mental health and substance use than individuals who identify as heterosexual. Few studies have extended these findings by testing potential downstream effects of LGBT disparities on mental health and substance use to positive outcomes such as subjective well-being. Moreover, resilience and social support are critical protective factors, but their moderating roles are not well understood. The aims of this study are to: (1) examine LGBT disparities in mental health, substance use, and subjective well-being; (2) test COVID-related stress and LGBT-specific discrimination as potential mediators; and (3) understand the extent to which resilience and social support act as buffers against stress, discrimination, mental health, and substance use on subjective well-being. Secondary aims include the exploration of sex differences and sexual minority subgroup differences in the mediators and outcomes.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We plan to analyze data from the All of Us COPE Survey to examine whether individuals who identify as LGBT experience disparities in mental health, substance use, and subjective well-being, and test the hypothesized pathways within a structural equation modeling framework.","Anticipated Findings
(1)	We hypothesize that individuals who identify as LGBT would be at higher risk for mental health and substance use behaviors, as well as lower subjective well-being than individuals who identify as heterosexual.
(2)	We anticipate that COVID-related stress and LGBT-specific discrimination would mediate the associations between LGBT status with mental health, substance use, and subjective well-being.
(3)	We expect that resilience and social support would moderate the hypothesized pathways.
The findings from this study will add to the literature on LGBT health disparities as it uniquely focuses on stressors and discrimination experiences during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings will have the potential to inform prevention efforts on the population level during a public health crisis.

Our study looked prevalence rates for the above conditions in the following ways:
1. Prevalence in EHR data available by various demographic factors
2. Cohort characteristics
3. Congruency for diagnoses in EHR and self-report questionnaire
4. Among individuals who self-report as having been diagnosed with a mental health condition listed above, the percentage of individuals in treatment and associations between treatment and various demographic factors","Project Purpose(s)

We are interested in the conditions that accompany obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are conditions that are risk factors for OSA, so we expect to see those prior to a diagnosis of the sleep problem. There are also many comorbidities of OSA, such as cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and diabetes. We believe that there may be mechanisms underlying OSA and these comorbidities that are present before diagnosis. We therefore want to look at when co-occurring conditions occur before and after a diagnosis of OSA. We also wish to assess those conditions in people without OSA as a comparison.","Project Purpose(s)

We will look at conditions relative to the date of diagnosis of OSA. We will assess the timeline of occurrence of events (diagnosis, survey, vital) relative to OSA, and assess the conditions that occur early, simultaneously or late. We will look at the conditions commonly associated with OSA (CV disease, mental health, etc) in people without indication of a sleep disorder, and see whether the timeline and severity differs with the OSA group.","Anticipated Findings
We expect to see conditions occurring prior to a diagnosis of OSA.

For my thesis, I am looking at the association between obstetric trauma (3rd/4th degree perineal tears) and mental health outcomes postpartum. While previous research has assessed the relationship between other types of trauma and health outcomes, there is a lack of research assessing the relationship between traumatic or adverse experiences during childbirth and mental health outcomes. This is an important area of research for two main reasons. First, identifying risk factors for imminent poor mental health outcomes is critical for interventions. Second, identifying poor outcomes associated with obstetric trauma can help advocate for more interventions to prevent obstetric trauma, particularly spontaneous tears.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health","Scientific Approaches
I will be using the All of Us dataset. This is a retrospective cohort study with women who have given birth in the All of Us dataset as the baseline population. Those women who have experienced obstetric trauma will be the exposed. Poisson regression will be used to assess the relationship between obstetric trauma and poor mental health indicators, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.","Anticipated Findings
I hypothesize that women who have experienced obstetric trauma are at a greater risk of poor mental health outcomes postpartum. This will be one of the first studies assessing this relationship with a national sample in the United States, and will therefore make a unique contribution to the field.

The impact of COVID-19 is particularly severe on older adults. The older adults (>= 65yr old) account for more than 80% of the mortality. Other reported negative outcomes include anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and physical inactivity. We propose to utilize this unique, rich set of data to study the relationship between social determinants of health (SDOH) and COVID impact on older adults’ behavior and mental health. Our overall hypothesis is that a comprehensive set of SDOH is associated the COVID impact.  Our specific aims are:  Aim 1. Identify SDOH factors that are significantly associated with COVID impact on older adults’ behavior, adjusting for age and comorbidities; Aim 2. Identify SDOH factors that are significantly associated with COVID impact on older adults’ mental health, adjusting for age and comorbidities.","Project Purpose(s)
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
We will use a logistic regression model as the primary approach, to describe and examine whether patients with certain SDOH will have a lower rate of COVID-related behavior (including hand washing and social distancing) and higher prevalence rates of mental health concerns.  Multivariable models will adjust for potential confounding factors.  In addition, given the multiple factors to be examined (i.e., SDOH, age, and comorbidities), the final models will consider controlling multiplicity to avoid inflated Type I error using Hochberg or false discovery rate method. Besides, we will complement the statistical analysis with explainable deep learning modeling. We will train deep transformer model  (type of DNN designed for sequence data) to identify the level of association between SDOH and COVID experience. The DNN approach will allow us to assess the impact and significance of each variable in the model using a DNN as well as the interactions between factors.","Anticipated Findings

Our focus is potential differential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation efforts on UBR and other vulnerable populations based on responses to the COPE surveys.
Specifically, we will:
1)	Describe ethnic and age differences (with a focus on those >65 years old) in responses to questions on:
1. Behaviors re: social distancing
2. Mental health
3. COVID symptoms, testing, treatment
4. Household composition/social isolation
5. Physical activity
6. Smoking, alcohol and other substance use
7. Resilience
8. Discrimination
2)	Examine associations between answers in each category by ethnicity and age, with a particular focus on mental health as an outcome.
3)	Examine any longitudinal changes for questions that are repeated across COPE surveys.
Understanding potential differential effects of the pandemic and on mental health among UBR and elderly populations will inform efforts to tailor interventions to reduce health disparities and foster resilience in these populations.","Project Purpose(s)

This study will compare survey responses to questions regarding social support, access to care, perceived discrimination, anxiety and stress, and drug abuse behaviors at 2 different points in time (6 months apart). In addition, we will compare responses from different racial/ethnic groups, gender identities, and income status to analyze demographic variables as significantly related to these variables. We will use the COPE survey to examine these items and will use SPSS to conduct Chi-Square analyses to examine relation between substance abuse and anxiety and stress, as well as Regression analyses to determine predictive power of social support, access to care, and discrimination on anxiety and stress.","Anticipated Findings

There is a rapidly growing body of literature--both national and international--reporting increased incidence of mental health conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of the risk and protective factors reported by recent COVID studies are known predictors of major psychiatric conditions. Further, most prior studies focus on the association of one risk factor with mental health risk at a time using linear models and do not examine multiple risk factors concurrently.

According to the CDC, 90% of the nation's $3.5 trillion annual health care expenditures is spent on treating chronic and mental health conditions. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) provided by Registered Dietitians has been shown to be an effective and cost-effective component of treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, in small clinical studies and medical practices in hospitals. Thus, MNT could be an additional powerful medical treatment for cardiometabolic diseases. However, there is no known large-scale research that examines the effectiveness of MNT in the diseases. By leveraging the national-level data from All of Us, we hope to determine if MNT could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. If possible, we would also like to determine if specific nutrition interventions provided in MNT produce significantly better health outcomes compared to other nutrition interventions provided in MNT.","Project Purpose(s)
Disease Focused Research (Cardiometabolic Diseases)
Drug Development","Scientific Approaches
We plan to conduct a prospective cohort study for individuals with cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndromes. Individuals with those diseases who have completed at least 1 MNT or no MNT will be included in the cohort. MNT is being provided by Registered Dietitians in hospitals and clinics, so data about MNT is available from the EHR. By following those individuals in the cohort over time, we will have their short-, middle-, and long-term health outcomes of the diseases. By comparing the health outcomes between individuals who completed MNT and individuals who did not, after adjusting potential confounders, we will determine if could significantly improve patients' health outcomes of the diseases. Additionally, we will attempt to categorize different MNTs based on their specific nutrition interventions and determine if specific MNTs are more effective.","Anticipated Findings
The primary outcome of the study is the overall effectiveness of MNT on cardiometabolic diseases. The secondary outcome of the study is the effectiveness of specific MNTs on cardiometabolic diseases. Our finding might provide evidence that MNT is an effective treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, in addition to medications and medical surgeries. MNT provided by Registered Dietitians could be an essential part of a health care team that is responsible for treating cardiometabolic diseases, positively impacting patients' weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose control.  Additionally, since MNT is cost-effective, it could help save health care expenditures, which is beneficial to alleviate the financial burden of the diseases. Lastly, because MNT is an individualized nutrition treatment, our findings could contribute to the understanding of the effect of precision nutrition on human health, as one-size-fits-all nutritional approaches have not been very effective.","Demographic Categories of Interest

The terms transgender and gender diverse are umbrella terms for individuals who gender identity is different from their sex assigned at birth. Little is known about the general health of these individuals. As such, we seek to characterize the health and wellbeing of this community and estimate any health disparities between transgender and cisgender individuals. The health conditions and behaviors we will examine include: smoking, body size, alcohol use, substance use, mental health, stress, disability, HIV, hepatitis B and C, HPV, gallstones, hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and receipt of preventative services (vaccinations and cancer screenings).","Project Purpose(s)

Our focus is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation efforts on breast cancer survivors and potential differences with matched controls without a history of cancer based on responses to the COPE surveys to determine whether survivor status has an influence on the experience of the pandemic in either positive or negative ways and to determine what factors (including socioeconomic or race/ethnicity) modify the experience.  Specifically, we will: 1) Describe differences between breast cancer survivors and age- and ethnicity-matched controls without a history of cancer in responses to questions on: 1. Behaviors re: social distancing 2. Mental health 3. COVID symptoms, testing, treatment 4. Social isolation and 5. Health behaviors.  Understanding specific effects of the pandemic on the mental health of breast cancer survivors will inform efforts to tailor interventions to reduce the negative effects of future similarly isolating events among this population.","Project Purpose(s)

Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
A series of Bayesian latent growth modeling will be used to assess between person differences and within-person changes on parents' anxiety, stress, and depression levels over time. Using a step-wise approach, a series of models will be tested iteratively by increasing model complexity: random intercept, random slope, non-linear slope, and growth mixture models to determine the best fitting trajectory.  Next, the impact of age, SES, and history of mental illness will be tested using conditional growth curve modeling, and growth trajectories will be compared across racial/ethnic groups by using multigroup latent growth curve models.","Anticipated Findings
Experiencing income loss or food insecurity during the COVID-19 could negatively affect the quality of parent-child interactions due to parents' increased distress. However, identifying the role of SES and neighborhood risk on the association between family financial difficulties and parents’ mental health trajectories can assist  policymakers to help identify the low-resource communities where programs and services can then focus efforts to provide services to in-need families.","Demographic Categories of Interest

This research is guided by the minority stress model, which suggests that minority groups experience stressors identity-specific stressors (over and above day-to-day stressors) that contribute to worse health outcomes over time. Our research conceptualizes the healthcare setting as particularly stressful for LGBTQ patients, and as such may be implicated as an identity-specific stressor. Our research will explore which aspects of healthcare access and utilization are associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes in LGBT populations. We hypothesize that participants who experience more difficulty in accessing care and more negative experiences will have worse physical and mental health outcomes compared to LGBT people with fewer access difficulties and fewer negative healthcare experiences. This research has significant practical implications for the healthcare domain as it could establish clear links between healthcare barriers and health disparities among LGBTQ populations.","Project Purpose(s)
Population Health
Social / Behavioral","Scientific Approaches
The dataset we hope to obtain will contain several sets of variables from the All of Us project: all variables from the demographic section, healthcare access and utilization section, lifestyle section, and overall health section. We are also interested in the item regarding mental health and substance use diagnoses within the personal medical history section. These diagnoses of mental health and substance use disorders will serve as the outcome variables in our theoretical model. Items within the healthcare access & utilization section such as “How often were you treated with respect by your doctors or healthcare providers?” and “Have you delayed getting care for any of the following reasons in the past 12 months?” will help us to understand and quantify the amount and quality of care received by LGBTQ patients. We plan to use SPSS software to analyze the dataset and assess the associations between relevant variables.","Anticipated Findings
We anticipate that this dataset will corroborate the well-established body of work that demonstrates the significant disparities in physical and mental health in LGBTQ populations compared to cisgender and heterosexual populations. We also anticipate that LGBTQ people who experience more difficulty in accessing care and more negative experiences will have worse physical and mental health outcomes compared to LGBT people with fewer access difficulties and fewer negative healthcare experiences. Overall, we hope that our findings will add to the minority stress theory literature, as the conceptualization of healthcare access and utilization as an identity-specific stressor for LGBT people is a novel application of the model. These findings could spur new explorations in this field of study, as health outcomes for LGBTQ people have not yet been linked to actual healthcare experiences within the minority stress theoretical model.","Demographic Categories of Interest

Approximately 10-20% of women suffer from mental health concerns during the perinatal period While the experience of pregnancy and of becoming a mother is often considered a positive experience, the perinatal period may be a complicated emotional experience, accompanied with psychosocial stress and symptoms of depression, anxiety and trauma related disorders. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased uncertainty for all, and largely adverse psychological consequences. We will examine the associations between psychosocial stress and other obstetric risks, and protective factors on the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women before and during COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent possible, we will stratify analyses by race/ethnicity to understand the extent to which risks are specific by group.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes a large burden of morbidity and mortality in the United States.  There are multiple factors that may influence how individuals with TBI recover and interact with the healthcare system after the initial injury, including demographic factors (age, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, urban vs. rural locations, etc.), patient factors (medical history, family medical history, medications), and clinical factors (co-occurring injuries, surgeries, and medical treatments).
